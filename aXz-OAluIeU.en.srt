1
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,050
You all have come now to Bangalore,

2
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,040
and yesterday you had gone to Mysore, which was

3
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,150
ruled by mahishasura.

4
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,120
That's the reason you didn't get your food - it crossed you.

5
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,140
It's better not to eat food in such places isn't it, all right.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,040
So it's a very beautiful place, Bangalore is.

7
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,100
Climate is beautiful and you'll find always these rakshasas

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,110
lived in places like this. Like in Pune, you have,

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,110
you know this Rajneesh was there â€“

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,070
here is this mahishasura.

11
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,080
They always try to find places which are cold

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,010
because they have so much heat in their body.

13
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,040
Now as you know, there's one more rakshasa here

14
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,050
who has to be exposed.

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:51,070
And this, today through our puja, we should achieve it.

16
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,220
In the olden days when the Goddess had to fight

17
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:08,240
the rakshasas, the rakshasas were not involved in human

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,230
beings as such.

19
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,200
They didn't become gurus or anything.

20
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,190
And so, now we find in Kali yuga they have gone into

21
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,020
the brains of sadhakas, of their devotees.

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,200
It's very difficult to remove them.

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,090
And once they go into the brain of the sadhakas,

24
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,130
then sadhakas become of course possessed, they suffer,

25
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,100
they have all kinds of problems.

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,230
Despite that, they stick onto that person because

27
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,110
they are mesmerized, very much mesmerized.

28
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,170
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely so strong

29
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,120
headed that even if they have to die,

30
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,100
they wouldn't give up their gurus.

31
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,190
The main thing is that in this Kali yuga there are so many

32
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,110
sadhakas, they are running helter and skelter.

33
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,220
They are running all over trying to find out some way

34
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,170
of finding the Truth.

35
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,010
Why when the market is on, you know you get people

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,200
to sell it also.

37
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,130
So that's how so many have come up and are trying

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,140
these things, tricks, on people all over.

39
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,140
Most of them have gone to the Western countries

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,210
because people have money.

41
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,090
Thank God we are not so rich in India that they could not

42
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,150
befool us - especially in America.

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,060
And Americans took to these people as a fish takes to

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,000
water, very simple.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,130
I went there and told them and warned them - they wouldn't

46
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,170
listen to Me. They can't understand anything that

47
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,040
you can get without money.

48
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,000
But despite all that, so many of you have been able to

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,200
come to Sahaja Yoga and get to the Reality.

50
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:33,230
It's your destiny. It's blessings to you of your previous lives

51
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,160
that you could see it so clearly and come to Sahaja Yoga

52
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,040
and now you have grown so much, you have become

53
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,070
so matured and you understand what others are doing

54
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,070
is absolutely wrong.

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,010
Also somebody told me about this fellow Boy John (George)

56
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,130
misbehaving with these homosexuals and all that,

57
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,130
and calling them "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna"

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,230
and all nonsense.

59
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,030
Then I discovered that this story is very prevalent in Kerala,

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,170
where they say that Krishna when he became, I mean

61
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,120
Vishnu, when he became Mohini, he had a child from Shiva.

62
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,240
Absurd. And now, Murti was telling Me when I told you this

63
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,020
story, you said "this is blasphemy, this is sin".

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
Same way I feel.

65
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,010
It is very dangerous also to play about with

66
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,240
a person like Vishnu. He is a very dangerous deity.

67
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,060
Shiva ultimately is very dangerous but it takes time with Him.

68
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,110
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has to be very

69
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,020
careful, misbehaving like this.

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I don't know what is going to happen to them.

71
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,040
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

72
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,070
One thing they should judge that if this thing you are doing

73
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,240
is good for them, is by God's blessings,

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,090
then why should you get diseases.

75
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,190
There is a regular one crore of people going to a nonsensical

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,080
place where they have this Ayappa business,

77
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,190
and they wear black dresses for one month,

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,170
and they have their beard and everything.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,120
They starve themselves, they go up miles together,

80
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,150
they climb do all kinds of things that is a sort of

81
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,050
a suffering for one month.

82
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,040
And eleven months they do everything.

83
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,020
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

84
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,130
So now it has become like a craze like jogging or something

85
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,080
like that in Kerala.

86
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,200
And this year there were one crore of people doing this

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,060
stupid nonsense.

88
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,040
I mean even in India we have such stupid people,

89
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,200
you can see that.

90
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,130
But the number is not so much, I must say,

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,020
as it is in America, percentage.

92
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,040
In India, we are very conditioned by these ritualisms,

93
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,130
especially in the South we have lots of ritualistic things.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,060
And we are impressed by people if you take out some watches,

95
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,230
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

96
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,010
To them, it is something really remarkable that how can you

97
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,170
have Swiss made watches here.

98
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,180
Very simple people.

99
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,210
They do not understand that none of the Incarnations did these

100
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:46,180
tricks and that truth should be based on the tradition,

101
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,150
on the shastras.

102
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:59,230
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates is actually heretic

103
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,030
and also is blasphemy.

104
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,050
But as I told you the other day that those people

105
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,070
who talk of Knowledge, like Sufis, who got their Realization,

106
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,050
real Sufis, they were called as heretics -

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,140
they were thrown out of the religion.

108
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,040
Also, the Christians, the early Christians,

109
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,070
who were Gnostics were called as mad people, heretics.

110
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,060
In the same way, those who are following stupid things,

111
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,050
and are following something that is very black and dark

112
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,130
negative, will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

113
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,230
and will say that this is something heretic or it is something

114
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,100
that is blasphemy.

115
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,170
But, as you understand now what it is, we have to bring forth

116
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,010
new laws that those who are not Sahaja Yogis are actually,

117
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,160
if they are practicing any religion, they are not doing

118
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,110
the right thing.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,140
Slowly, slowly as Vatican is getting exposed and

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,170
the Christian churches are getting exposed,

121
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,220
even in India so many such organizations are getting exposed,

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,190
and people are understanding that this is very wrong.

123
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,080
These ideas actually have come from incarnations,

124
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,140
like Adi Shankaracharya said "Tatatkim, Tatakim, Tatatkim" -

125
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,000
if you have not followed your guru then "Tatatkim".

126
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,180
So they said now any guru can come from the jail,

127
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:58,150
can be a smuggler, can be anything, characterless person -

128
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,210
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

129
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,160
Whatever we call somebody, say we call somebody as a guru

130
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,200
and we stick on, "this is my guru".

131
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,150
But what did the guru give to you, that nobody asks.

132
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,070
You just feel happy, oh very nice. It's like the worms

133
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,140
clinging onto the lotus and saying, "oh, we have lotus".

134
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,080
What about you, you are a worm still, what is the use of these

135
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,130
lotuses or whether that is lotus or a snake, God only knows.

136
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,080
So a guru who doesn't talk of Realization,

137
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,090
who doesn't talk of Kundalini, who doesn't talk of ascent,

138
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,220
who doesn't talk of second birth - cannot be a guru -

139
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,240
minimum of minimum.

140
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,220
So like we also believe in say Rama - "I believe in Rama" -

141
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,230
so what? Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging you.

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,230
"I believe in Christ" - so what?

143
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,020
You believe in this, you believe in that -

144
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,070
it is such an absurd idea still I never understand when people

145
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,230
say, "I believe in this".

146
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,070
What does that make, what does that mean.

147
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,240
You believe in Christ.

148
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,020
You are leading a licentious life, you are doing all kinds -

149
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,020
but "I believe in Christ, I believe in God".

150
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,210
Doing everything against divinity and I believe.

151
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,080
So the question comes, what do you mean by believing?

152
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,180
It's like, "I believe it is silver" - so what, it is silver.

153
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,000
What does it make to you to believe by that,

154
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,200
saying something you have done great.

155
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,150
What is great in that?

156
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,190
Now if you say I believe in Shri Mataji, so what.

157
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,200
All right you believe in Me because of certain experiences -

158
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,170
still what?

159
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,170
Mataji should be in your life -

160
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:23,100
should be in your expression, in your behaviour,

161
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,080
in your treatment to others,

162
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,070
in understanding each other, and loving each other.

163
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,090
That is what impresses people.

164
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,160
People say, "All right, we'll come to Mataji,

165
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,060
e'll just pray to Her and go away - we'll not talk to Her.

166
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,050
Why? Because we believe in Mataji. Finished.

167
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,000
So now we have to understand that you believe in Sahaja Yoga,

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,210
of course it is shraddha (faith), it is not a blind faith I agree,

169
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,110
but still belief has to penetrate into your being.

170
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,210
This belief has to act, has to show results,

171
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,170
it has to work out in every way.

172
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,010
Somebody might say that we believe in Mataji and

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
She does everything - She'll do bhakti for us?

174
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,130
Should sit down and sing the song of Mataji or what?

175
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,230
So what is going to come from your side, that is what we have

176
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,240
to understand and once that starts working then these demons

177
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,140
and these rakshasas will all vanish, no problem.

178
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,030
So what am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?

179
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,020
You should ask the question, "what am I doing?".

180
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,150
Now if you make this instrument, and then if it is not doing

181
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,070
anything, what is the use of making the instrument.

182
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,210
Now you are the light, you have got enlightenment

183
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,170
but what is the use of a light which is hanging somewhere,

184
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,110
which is not giving light to anyone.

185
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,010
So when you are giving light to others, in a very innocent

186
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,120
manner, in a very reciprocal manner -

187
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,110
not this way that we are giving light because we want to have

188
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,220
an advantage over it, or we want to show off or

189
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,030
any all nonsensical things that are there.

190
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,130
Then the derailment starts. People start saying,

191
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,190
"Oh, I am this, I am that."

192
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,170
But with full understanding, that we are instruments

193
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:50,000
in the hands of the divinity and we are just enjoying

194
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,110
that divinity flowing through us and working out,

195
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,070
you won't feel tired, you won't feel upset,

196
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,060
you'll not be in any way in trouble.

197
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,010
But this has happened with you.

198
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:12,030
You are so matured, but still we all have to decide that

199
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,160
now we are going to India to get ourselves the whole joy

200
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,190
of the tour - but for what?

201
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,210
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it with others.

202
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,060
This joy is for you to share it with others.

203
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,000
Unless and until you learn that, your ego

204
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,220
will come back again and again.

205
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,000
And also you have seen the way people who have been

206
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,120
even spreading Sahaja Yoga got into the mess of ego.

207
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,180
So one has to be very careful.

208
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,210
The more you are rising in your divinity,

209
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,120
the more you are maturing, you have to be very careful.

210
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,230
See on a tree if you see, if there's a leaf no insect will enter.

211
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,090
If there's a flower, the insect will come

212
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,180
and it will make it into a fruit.

213
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,240
But when it is a fruit, then the insect will enter and eat it off.

214
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,100
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have to be very careful

215
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,160
that no insect should get into you.

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,100
On the contrary, now you have the capacity to destroy

217
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,050
all of the insects.

218
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,080
And that is what is, I would say, is the state where we should

219
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,070
all come up to.

220
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,210
So you are destroying insects on one side and

221
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,030
satisfying people on the other side.

222
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,190
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is the only way

223
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,230
you can be cleansed, but the greater thing is to go out, all out,

224
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,180
to find out where can I spread Sahaja Yoga - where can I go,

225
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,230
what is the nearest village I can go, where will I work it out.

226
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,110
All of those things the more you think the better it is and

227
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,030
you start moving in that direction.

228
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,210
Once you start moving in that direction, you will be surprised

229
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,000
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

230
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,000
You'll meet the people whom who want,

231
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:27,020
you'll get all the necessary help that you want,

232
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,130
suddenly you'll find some people who'll come down

233
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,010
and say "now what can we do for you."

234
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,050
Every type of help starts coming to you the way

235
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,230
you expand yourself.

236
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,100
Its like the expanding your wings, like a bird does,

237
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,230
and then you take off.

238
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,080
But if you don't extend yourself, you keep Sahaja Yoga

239
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,170
to yourself only, it doesn't work.

240
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,040
I know you love me very much and you know

241
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,130
I love you very much, but don't you think others should

242
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,140
also share this love.

243
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,220
Others should also have this.

244
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,200
Now when we start struggling, we also struggle with people

245
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,240
who are very difficult - like my brother, my brother's son...

246
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,210
Just don't go near "my", get away.

247
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,170
"My" is the most difficult thing. You see in my family,

248
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,180
I don't touch them because once you go to "my" they sit

249
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,010
on your heads, or maybe they'll sit on the heads

250
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,210
of the Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

251
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,140
So don't go to the people - it is my sister,

252
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,050
she's my sister in law, nothing of the kind.

253
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,180
What you have to do is to see what is beyond

254
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,090
and the more you'll go beyond the better it will be.

255
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,230
See you can see clearly, we have worked so had in Maharashtra

256
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,020
it is a useless place I find.

257
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,160
Maharashtran Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

258
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,040
but whatever are there are also not so good.

259
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,050
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here in Madras, in Bangalore,

260
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,140
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

261
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,000
So much work I have done there.

262
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,220
So those who are very near to you, always cannot see

263
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,090
the greatness of you.

264
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,220
Like if you go near the big mountain you cannot see

265
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,190
the big mountain, you have to be away and then you see.

266
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,170
In the same way, when you want to do some work with anyone,

267
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,060
try to see that you are not closely related nor do you have

268
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,220
any connections with them.

269
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,140
Something unknown.

270
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,020
These people are much better for you to follow and they

271
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,190
will keep your attention tight, absolutely.

272
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,030
Otherwise the people who are known to you will trouble you.

273
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,050
Now there are many difficulties in spreading Sahaja Yoga -

274
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,210
there were many many more before,

275
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,110
slowly these are coming down.

276
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,140
Naturally it is much better than at the time of Thomas

277
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,180
because he had to hide his treatise to save it from others.

278
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,070
He thought a day will come when there will be resurrection time,

279
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,020
then this treatise would be revealed.

280
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,080
Imagine, only 48 years back,

281
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,110
now it would be around 53 or 50 years back, it was discovered.

282
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,090
It was not discovered before. He had to hide it.

283
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,020
But now we are not to hide.

284
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,010
We are to go all out and must know, must forgive.

285
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,060
That, you see, ours is an open place where anybody can come in.

286
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,090
So we get all kinds of people - if you go and meet people

287
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,100
also there is all kinds of oppositions, all these things,

288
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,100
doesn't matter.

289
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,170
Everything can be overcome but first is your own initiative

290
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,120
and your own lethargy which has to be overcome.

291
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,070
Then it will start spreading out. Of course we have already

292
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,010
lot of Sahaja Yogis - in Russia, we say we have so many

293
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,170
in thousands.

294
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,030
But in every place we can have lots of people now and I'm sure

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,160
this is a nice year where they say so predict that

296
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,130
Sahaja Yoga will grow very much this year.

297
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,020
So this is the beginning we are starting today.

298
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,040
I just wanted to tell you that you have the power,

299
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,020
you have the Shakti within your reach.

300
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,080
They said it was very cold one day before I came here,

301
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,140
I said don't worry - I didn't give bandhan or anything.

302
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,090
I just came here and how they know. It's become all right,

303
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,050
you are sitting in your kurta pyjamas.

304
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,170
Otherwise you would have been in your three piece

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,040
suits shivering. That's how it works.

306
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,140
But you have to be that way dedicated.

307
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:28,060
Now for all these Surya [Sun] and Chandra [Moon] and all these

308
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:34,000
stars and whole cosmos has only one thing to do -

309
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,100
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading well,

310
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,050
is settling well and is achieving it's goal.

311
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,160
Every element is working it out.

312
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,200
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya is working around

313
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,020
so many ways.

314
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,150
You are not to be convinced about Me I know.

315
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,000
But now you have to be convinced about yourself

316
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,050
that you have all the powers within you.

317
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,150
I mean I don't do anything really to be very frank.

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,110
If I could do everything, I would not have had it,

319
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,170
I would have done it myself.

320
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,220
But you have to do it - you are My channels.

321
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,020
You are the channels of Shakti.

322
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,150
But do it in a way which is gracious, which is beautiful,

323
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,100
which is very satisfying.

324
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,240
Like yesterday, that musician -

325
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,160
he just wanted to entertain you.

326
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,100
He wanted to play.

327
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,240
Even he was enjoying it.

328
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,210
In the same way we should want to do it.

329
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,120
I don't have to tell you.

330
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:51,200
And I am sure, in every area that you work, in every personality

331
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,070
whom you meet, you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga

332
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,050
and tell them. It works. It acts.

333
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,220
Moreover it is behind you, the whole power of all the deities

334
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,040
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running forward fast,

335
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,010
this Paramchaitanya.

336
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,110
Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming, all right, let them not eat

337
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:18,060
their food, finished, organize it.

338
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,060
Everything so beautifully done.

339
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,150
Now see the arrangements - I mean I was thinking

340
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,100
such few people here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

341
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,240
can you believe it, all this arrangement.

342
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,110
How it's working out.

343
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,120
How it is giving results, it's really remarkable.

344
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,070
So have faith in yourself, have faith in all of Them helping you

345
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,160
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

346
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,060
Because the Shakti is in you. You have the Power.

347
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,060
Every kind of Power you have, I assure you,

348
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,220
you have every power.

349
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,050
Ask for It and you'll have It.

350
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,220
Whatever you ask for, you'll have It.

351
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,200
But don't hesitate. As I said the other day, that I beg you

352
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:16,070
sit on the throne and also I put the crown on your head.

353
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,220
And also I say that you are the king but still you are running

354
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,010
away and not believing Me - looking this side with fear -

355
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,110
"Am I a king, really how can I be?"

356
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,160
That's not the way. Have faith in yourself.

357
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,140
I'm very happy you all have come here.

358
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,200
We are trying to do whatever is possible to make you

359
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,200
comfortable and for you to provide whatever is necessary.

360
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:56,110
Of course you are only just spirits and you try to find

361
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,200
the comfort of your spirit.

362
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,210
I know that you are very adjusting yourself.

363
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,030
Everybody is surprised how you people from the West

364
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,050
who just believe in materialism can take to Sahaja Yoga -

365
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,080
they are quite surprised.

366
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:21,170
But you are all very sweet people, I think something

367
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:28,070
very special who have come to Sahaja Yoga.

368
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,000
And by God's grace, I'm sure you will be the people

369
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:43,000
who will be the foundation of Sahaja Yoga and you will build

370
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:54,020
the great mansion of Sahaja Yoga with your wisdom, faith,

371
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,060
shakti and love.

372
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,110
Today we'll worship the Shakti - very much needed - the Shakti

373
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,060
who destroyed all the devils, all the rakshasas.

374
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,040
That is what you are going to worship today -

375
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,210
the Shakti within you and without.

376
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,000
It's your desire which is going to work.

377
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,240
So today we are going to worship the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

378
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,050
May God bless you.

379
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,020
So, today first will have the washing of Feet

380
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,000
and with that will have

381
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,050
one Atharva Shirsha we'll do

382
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,020
and then we can have thousand names,

383
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,070
which have made very easily

384
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,240
compiled together by the noida people,

385
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,220
which you can sing.

386
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,000
That's how we can worship the Shakti.
