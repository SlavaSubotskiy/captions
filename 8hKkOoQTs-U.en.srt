00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:18,311
[CLAPPING]

2
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:21,847
We said on our National television to day that

3
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:25,107
sahaja yoga is a respectable yoga

4
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:30,847
because of some so called yogas that have gone before.

5
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:34,547
Shri Mataji has come to

6
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:43,607
show us the truth because that's what we all desire for.

7
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:48,167
That we have a special reason for existence -

8
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:53,087
- it is to find the truth.

9
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:59,567
And those of us who have been blessed to be with Her

10
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:05,827
have found the truth. So She's come to Sydney

11
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,827
to tell us about the truth.

12
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:17,887
In a very troubled world, has arrived with

13
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:24,947
many other wrong answers to our troubles - the answers of drugs, hard and soft

14
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:31,767
and other things that distract us - we found that those are not the answer.

15
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:39,547
Holy Mother thank You for coming and thank You for being with us.

16
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:47,207
So, once again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

17
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,267
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

18
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:11,627
The idea about truth

19
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:16,967
is sometimes a misconception.

20
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:24,867
Truth is what it is and will be the truth.

21
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:31,387
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,

22
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:36,687
we cannot work it out - it remains what it is.

23
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,847
And the greatest truth is that we all have become human beings

24
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:50,187
to become the spirit. We're still

25
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:58,987
not in that stage that's why there are problems around us.

26
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:05,547
Once you become the truth, it being the Absolute,

27
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:11,127
you reach the state of Absoluteness. Then there is

28
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:16,927
no difference of ideologies,

29
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:22,967
no differences of nation -

30
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:29,607
- all nations one knows are created by God Almighty.

31
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:38,847
Just He created variety to give a beautiful world to us.

32
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:45,987
Variety always gives beauty.

33
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:52,707
That's why this variety was created just to make the world very interesting

34
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:58,407
but not for fighting or for quarreling or for believing

35
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:04,107
that this part belongs to us and that part belongs to somebody else.

36
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:20,847
The human problem, as I have studied, is very simple -

37
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:29,147
- is to be understood in a detached way.

38
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:38,887
Now here you can see the beautiful machinery that is working within ourselves.

39
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:47,487
If you see on the left-hand side we have [ASIDE - SOMEBODY SHOULD COME AND SHOW] blue colored line

40
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:53,347
and the right-hand side you see a yellow line.

41
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,907
In the center you see a white channel

42
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:10,667
These are our Autonomous Nervous Systems - three channels -

43
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:15,087
Left and Right Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

44
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:22,347
When I talk of Medical Science people get quite surprised.

45
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:29,367
But it has something to do to understand what are we inside ourselves.

46
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:35,707
Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system that gives us balance.

47
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:43,367
For example, if I'm running fast, My heart will start thumping

48
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:47,407
but it comes to normal through Parasympathetic Nervous System.

49
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:54,647
And Medical Science doesn't know much about the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is actually in the center.

50
00:09:55,787 --> 00:10:01,327
These chakras are around the Parasympathetic Nervous System and

51
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:11,667
like My fingers here, this is the chakra in the center here

52
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:19,087
and this the Left Sympathetic and this the Right Sympathetic and they both put together make this center

53
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,147
to form the Parasympathetic - simple as that.

54
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:32,347
Now what happens with human-beings, that they have a capacity, they have a freedom also

55
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:40,287
to go to the left or to the right. They can be very emotional people.

56
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:46,827
They can go to the emotional side to such an extent that they can become fanatics.

57
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:54,687
They can go further with it so that

58
00:10:55,947 --> 00:11:03,487
the left side which represents our Subconscious,

59
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:09,927
then the Collective Subconscious can be entered into.

60
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:14,707
So they can enter into Collective Subconscious also.

61
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:23,427
Subconscious also has 3 - 4 layers that is we can say the Present Subconscious,

62
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:27,847
the Past Subconscious and the Subconscious of ages.

63
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:34,707
Then the Collective Subconscious where all that is dead exists in that area.

64
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:43,647
Now, when you move too much on that side, you get attacked by that side

65
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:52,547
and that side has got all that is dead which attacks you, which triggers you.

66
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:04,227
On the right hand side we have got another channel of the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

67
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:13,967
This channel represents our activity and our future.

68
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:23,647
So when you're overactive, you're working very hard, you're futuristic - all the time thinking about the future

69
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:28,127
- you start moving towards the right side

70
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:37,187
to such an extent that you can enter into your Collective Supra-conscious also.

71
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:44,307
In the same way you have got your Present Supra-conscious and also Collective Supra-conscious.

72
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:54,007
Now, human beings have a capacity, that they can move to the left and to the right with their attention.

73
00:12:54,247 --> 00:13:01,467
They can project their attention to the left or to their right or they can be moderate in the center.

74
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:10,567
So, when people talked of religion - I mean the real people who came on this earth, they talked of religion -

75
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:18,727
they talked about our valency, that's a human valency is of ten number -

76
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:25,507
and that's why they talked of ten commandments. Or in every religion they talked about it

77
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:31,447
that we have to keep this balance. When we go out of this balance

78
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:35,027
then we either move to the left or to the right.

79
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:41,487
But, if you see the history of religions, it is just the opposite.

80
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:47,887
That all these religions have created conditionings within us -

81
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:53,447
a kind of a fanatism, a kind of a blind faith

82
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:59,607
which was never the purpose of establishing your

83
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,707
valencies within yourself.

84
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:13,107
The movement to the right is also another problem of the modern times.

85
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:20,307
When we move to the right, we actually start becoming very egoistical.

86
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:28,467
The activity that we form, the activity that we perform

87
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,887
creates a balloon like structure on our head, as you see, crossing over here,

88
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:40,727
as ego - that yellow stuff.

89
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:51,387
On the left hand side when we're conditioned very much, we get another balloon, which we call as super-ego.

90
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:03,227
Jung also, missed the point because he described

91
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:09,067
that there're layers horizontally placed within ourselves - it is not so.

92
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:16,007
God, is a great constructor and a manager.

93
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:23,967
For example, you have put a road for Me here - I don't have to pass through different, different rows.

94
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:31,247
In the same way He placed everything in a vertical way

95
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:36,287
and the road to realization is kept free within us.

96
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:41,887
The road to realization is straightforward, which you see,

97
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:47,007
is the shown in the white color, is the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

98
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:55,667
Now those people who move to the left or to the right, develop diseases.

99
00:15:56,427 --> 00:16:02,287
For example, I'll show you here, now supposing, I move one finger too much here

100
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,927
then I'm cut off, cut off with the main -

101
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:14,947
this side is cut off with the main, this side is cut off with the main. Then what happens that there is no control

102
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:23,867
and the cells become malignant, on their own. They start over-powering others

103
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:29,707
and that's how they start destroying other cells - we say cancer has been established.

104
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:39,287
Is a very simple thing, is to bring them back again and put them in contact

105
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,887
with the Divine and bring them to the mains.

106
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:53,507
Secondly, people have these days diseases like Diabetes - very common, Diabetes is a very common disease.

107
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:59,847
Now in Indian villages, the villagers when they take tea

108
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:07,467
they say, the we must take so much sugar that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

109
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:14,027
And they drink such a lot of sugar - they never have Diabetes, never - they have never known Diabetes.

110
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:22,147
What is the cause of Diabetes or liver trouble

111
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:27,007
or we can say, other troubles like Blood Cancer?

112
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:33,307
Is a very simple thing that we do - is the imbalance within us.

113
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:39,507
Is you see, the yellow center we call as Swadhisthana,

114
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:45,787
which looks after the Aortic plexus in our body, on the physical level,

115
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:50,267
this center has a very special work to do

116
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:57,207
that is to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain.

117
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:01,607
So it converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

118
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:10,387
If people are very futuristic - all the time thinking, thinking, thinking - then this poor

119
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:19,247
center or chakra has one work, is to convert cells after cells for the use of the brain.

120
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:24,667
Brain starts growing but what about the other function it has to do?

121
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:31,687
It has to look after the liver, it has to look after the pancreas,

122
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:39,767
it has to look after the spleen, it has to look after part of the intestines and also the kidneys.

123
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:47,427
When we start thinking too much, we give too much work to this one center

124
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:54,427
all these visceras are neglected and you may develop any one of these troubles.

125
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:58,327
But when it comes to spleen, it is even worse.

126
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:06,127
When it comes to spleen - these days the life is so hectic - first of all,

127
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:13,027
we get up in the morning, first thing we do is to read the newspaper - that's the horrid thing to do.

128
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:19,127
Coming out of very nice sleep, you suddenly read the newspaper and so many are bombed,

129
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:22,867
so many are killed and so many are harassed - Oh God!

130
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:27,127
You get a shock, the system gets a shock.

131
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:33,067
Now, when the system gets a shock, the spleen has to

132
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:37,967
produce more Red blood corpuscles - it has to work very hard.

133
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:44,367
Then you suddenly discover, you have to go to your work, so you get out of your bed and rush here and there,

134
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:51,567
brush your teeth on your way and carry your breakfast - maybe your wife is running after you with the breakfast - you have no time for anything.

135
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,867
Such a hectic life you lead - extremely hectic.

136
00:19:56,187 --> 00:20:00,027
Then you get into the car, you find there's a jam - finished.

137
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:04,827
Is a, we don't understand how much you're shocking ourselves all the time.

138
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:09,647
We are on a war path with the watch.

139
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:14,907
All the time struggling for time, struggling for time.

140
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:20,687
This spleen doesn't understand the person -

141
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:26,087
there's no rhythm in the life of that person.

142
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:35,027
The spleen thinks, what am I to do now? Suddenly this person needs the Red blood corpuscles, then it doesn't need, then suddenly it needs it - it becomes hectic.

143
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:44,887
It needs hec.. when it becomes hectic, it becomes vulnerable for Blood Cancer.

144
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:53,507
And then, if a person gets any shock or goes to the left side in an emotional way, he gets Blood Cancer.

145
00:20:54,387 --> 00:21:01,187
Even the mothers who are like this, very hectic, disciplining their children, "Keep the carpet clean,

146
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:07,447
eh..walk this way, first put your right foot then left foot, don't walk that way" -

147
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:14,767
the child, when she's pregnant, can get Blood Cancer.

148
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:26,007
We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God, we're human beings

149
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:31,547
and the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

150
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:38,567
This is the blossom time. But we shock our system with so many things - for what have we achieved?

151
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:48,807
In India we have Taj Mahal, we have Ajanta caves, we have so many things to show you

152
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:56,587
but they are all in the past. I don't think in Sydney you can make a hall like this anymore - is not possible.

153
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,687
What have we achieved - plastics?

154
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,307
What are we achieving?

155
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:16,307
The modern times we have lost the sense of greatness and glorious things.

156
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:23,747
All the time you're struggling with time and no body has time.

157
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:32,647
Everybody is rushing up. I asked one gentleman, "Why're you in such a hurry to go to London, after all,

158
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:37,187
it's all right you can go tomorrow, if you don't get the seat today you can go tomorrow?"

159
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:40,327
He said, "No, I have to attend a ball."

160
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:45,887
He'll waste 3 hours in the ball or in a pub, that's all right.

161
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:54,007
But, he's so worried about getting his ticket - for that he will completely rattle his system.

162
00:22:56,707 --> 00:23:00,147
Just to get the ticket and that for what?

163
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:05,727
That ball is not going to give him any relaxation because he's already finished his system.

164
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:10,527
That's how one develops this Blood Cancer.

165
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:20,267
Then the pancreas is out of order, one develops Diabetes

166
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:24,127
Kidneys are out of order - high blood pressure.

167
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:30,207
Then all kinds of kidney troubles and then they go on the machine and all kinds of things happen.

168
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:41,947
It is happening in all the nonsensical things also we have taken.

169
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:48,487
Like for us now, so far he was, Mr. Freud was

170
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:54,647
had displaced Christ completely. He had become Christ for us.

171
00:23:56,227 --> 00:24:02,107
Blind-folded we followed him and also out-witted him

172
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:07,487
in our projections. "What's wrong?"

173
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:14,107
When I went to America in '73

174
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:21,087
I told them that this is all wrong you're doing, it will have a very bad effect, it's not natural.

175
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:26,587
If promiscuousness is good, then why does it give diseases?

176
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:33,947
If it is natural, then why does it give you problems - simple question?

177
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:44,987
There's a kind of a ego that we can do it - but why fight with the nature?

178
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:53,267
If you fight with the nature, nature will take it's respite.

179
00:24:54,767 --> 00:25:02,007
And today that's why, we have to say, "This was wrong we have done and we're not going to do it anymore."

180
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:05,647
Our children are not going to do it.

181
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:15,087
After going through all the experiences now they're talking that cigarette should be abandoned.

182
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:24,367
But Nanak Sahab had told long time back that cigarette is the worst thing, it will cause horrible trouble to you.

183
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:31,227
Now they're saying about no smoking - now they cannot give up.

184
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:40,687
There are thousand and one problems - the greatest is, I think now, is AIDS -

185
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:46,387
is caused by nothing but stupid ego.

186
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:58,267
Anything they try, you ask them why do you do it ; like some people are now coloring their heads.

187
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:05,747
And I found some of them are becoming blind. So I said, "Why are you doing it?" They said, "What's wrong?"

188
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:12,947
But why do you want to color your hair? "But what's wrong?" I didn't know what to answer.

189
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:20,487
I said, "But it will make you blind." "We'll see when it makes us blind." - Such arrogance!

190
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:30,467
You can't challenge your system like that, you have to be humble about it because it's a delicate system of a human being.

191
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:38,267
We are not hippopotamus, are we? That on a hippopotamus you paint anything, nothing will happen to him.

192
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:45,327
But we're human beings, we have got cells here, which absorb paints and that can go on to our nerves,

193
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:49,127
can also go on to our other centers.

194
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:58,427
There should be a basic understanding - what is ridiculous?

195
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:12,907
As if, people have gone a muck and doing all these things - but that's what, you're going to the left or to the right.

196
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:20,807
Now, those people who move too much to the right, get heart attacks.

197
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:30,187
They maybe thin like dried fishes but they can get heart attacks.

198
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:38,847
When you extract too much of your energy on the right side, the heart gives in.

199
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:50,247
There is no need to put in so much effort

200
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:56,847
- like one day I met a lady who had a heart attack -

201
00:27:57,707 --> 00:28:01,607
she's just a housewife with only two children.

202
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:10,227
I said, "Why do you get a heart attack, madam?" She said, "I've to work very hard, You know."

203
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:18,127
"With two children what do you do?" "Oh, I've to keep everything clean, absolutely clean,

204
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:24,327
to keep my children clean, I've to keep my husband clean, I've to keep my bathroom clean, to keep," and I said,

205
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:31,727
"It's all right, but why don't you understand that also your health is there and you should take some rest in between."

206
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:36,827
"No, to me cleanliness is everything." Then you have the heart attack.

207
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:43,867
This is the norms of today's life.

208
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:49,227
I don't think our parents used to polish everything all the time

209
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:55,367
or they were all the time with a vacuum cleaner, you see, like a tail we have a vacuum cleaner with us.

210
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:02,707
Doesn't matter, it's house. After all, it should be a cozy place for children

211
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:08,187
and for the husband to come down. Doesn't matter, once you clean it, it's all right.

212
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:13,467
But that kind of a attitude we cannot take because that's the norm.

213
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:21,787
So many norms we have which are really absurd and ridiculous.

214
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,427
We can never sit down and enjoy each other's company.

215
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:34,567
If the husband and wife are sitting, there should be a television in between or some sort of a drama or something.

216
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:42,447
There should be something in between, they cannot talk to each other - there's no relaxing mood.

217
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:46,267
There's so much to be talked between husband and wife.

218
00:29:46,507 --> 00:29:53,067
I mean, when husband wife are enjoying themselves and talking to each other, it's better to switch off the horrible

219
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:58,127
television which is showing the quarrel between husband and wife all the time.

220
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:11,087
So, all these things work out - the family system, the household and the all the norms we have started.

221
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:17,467
All these things work out on our sweet beautiful system that we have.

222
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:23,347
We are fighting all the time with each other, for what?

223
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:32,507
This is what takes us to the extremes and these extremes are responsible for giving us all these problems.

224
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:42,367
Now, with the Kundalini awakening, when She rises, passes through those centers -

225
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:47,447
first of all She puts them like a slot, they all come back,

226
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:55,107
fall in lines, She awakens them, gives them energy, the energy flows out

227
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:58,967
cures cancer, cures this, cures that, cures that.

228
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:06,207
Then it passes through your Agnya chakra here, where you forgive everyone.

229
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:15,847
You just forgive. You don't know, what a weapon Christ has given us to forgive.

230
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:21,127
Half of the marriages would be all right if we know how to forgive.

231
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:29,787
Just makes you a sweet, beautiful, charming person

232
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:35,167
in the real sense of the word, not outwardly because you're dressed up well or you have

233
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:43,047
a beautiful ornament or something like that. You really become a very charming person in the sense

234
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:50,667
that you charm the children, you charm your family, you charm the whole world.

235
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:59,287
Because once you start forgiving, the love of your heart starts pouring everywhere.

236
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:09,567
When She opens this last center, actually here on the fontanel bone area, where you get your real baptism

237
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:16,567
this is the, we call the seat of the heart center, seat of the heart center.

238
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:21,927
When She opens the transformation starts

239
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:30,927
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So, the transformation in the temperament,

240
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:37,947
in the behavior of a person - you immediately notice the face changing -

241
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:45,167
the tense face that you see suddenly becomes mellowed down - we're relaxed.

242
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:53,547
And this Kundalini awakening then kept up well, makes you grow spiritually.

243
00:32:54,767 --> 00:33:00,287
And the spiritual growth in a person is what we want today.

244
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:09,407
Of course, no diseases, no physical problems, no mental problems -

245
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:16,827
many mad people have been cured, this Schizophrenia has been cured with sahaja yoga.

246
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:24,107
Is all because our spirit has not come into our attention.

247
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:30,767
Spirit is the light but the light we see here is jarring sometimes -

248
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:35,867
has nothing in it - the light of the spirit has love -

249
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:45,447
is beautiful love about which we have heard about, which is All Pervading, is all over

250
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:53,007
and you just feel absolutely sure of yourself as if you're entered

251
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:59,387
into the beautiful hall of God's kingdom where you're secured, you're respected,

252
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:03,247
you're loved, you're looked after - is a fact.

253
00:34:05,347 --> 00:34:09,907
But we have to enter there and we have to receive that blessing.

254
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:16,107
Then this physical things look nothing, insignificant.

255
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:20,987
If somebody has some problem you can go and cure it, I need not be there.

256
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:27,507
You can raise the Kundalini of other people. This is your birthright

257
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:33,027
to get the Kundalini awakened and to have your real baptism.

258
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:41,527
You have got it within yourself, all is your power - I'm doing nothing,

259
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:48,547
maybe a catalyst - for a little while and then you become the catalyst.

260
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:55,667
The whole world can change and transform itself

261
00:34:56,447 --> 00:35:01,807
if it follows the power of love. We have never used the power of love -

262
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:05,447
is all the power of hatred all the time.

263
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:11,707
But the power of love that is Divine love is devoid of lust and greed -

264
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:15,607
is just you enjoy the loving of love.

265
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:25,127
And that situation when it works, you see the whole world in a different way

266
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:30,167
and you develop that witness state which is described many a times by many saints

267
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:33,387
and many prophets and Incarnations.

268
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:41,507
It's a very easy thing to happen, it is spontaneous because it's the living force,

269
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:50,087
is the living thing - you cannot pay for it, it's ridiculous to think that you can pay for it - you cannot.

270
00:35:52,727 --> 00:36:00,627
How much money did we pay to the plants which produce these beautiful flowers - nothing.

271
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:04,927
They just gave you the flowers because they enjoy giving.

272
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:15,007
That sort of personalities we all become - beautiful people. Actually we have wasted our life quite a lot.

273
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:22,307
After realization we understand how valuable we are, how glorified we are,

274
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:29,987
how God loves us and how He looks after us moment to moment!

275
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:40,407
These imbalances within us have now increased more by time

276
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:49,487
because the ego increased a lot and then we said, "Why not do this, why not try this, why not try that,"

277
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:57,407
like everybody going a muck trying this, trying that, trying that. Everything new they should have,

278
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:08,027
they did not believe in what people told them before, they discarded all that and they said, "Let's try everything new."

279
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:14,167
Like, the other day we were having a banquet and there was an ambassador sitting next to Me

280
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:19,707
and he said, "I know, You don't like Freud." Oh, I said, " I don't like him at all."

281
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:26,147
But he said, "He told us something new, while Hume didn't tell us something new, You see."

282
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:32,767
I said, "All right, we've had dinner many a times but we have never eaten the table, let's have it."

283
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:39,607
[LAUGHTER] That's a new thing, why not? He was shocked at Me.

284
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:47,147
He said, " Everything new can be very dangerous."

285
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:52,967
Let us try with the snakes, let us try with the tigers.

286
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:04,447
This is the trouble with us. We have to humble down to understand that no, this

287
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:11,827
is a trust of God within us - this body of ours - we have no business to insult it,

288
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:20,587
to be disrespectful to it, to waste it - we have to respect it.

289
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:31,507
With what difficulty it was made, the whole, you see, beautiful mechanism that is made within us

290
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:36,287
and it works so spontaneously, so beautifully -

291
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:42,147
even whatever you have done to it, doesn't matter, forget it -

292
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,827
even if you have not respected it, forget it.

293
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:54,967
Please don't develop any guilt - that's another disease of the modern times - everybody is guilty.

294
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:02,767
Why are you guilty? You're human beings, if you have done mistakes so it's all right.

295
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:09,807
It's for God to correct it - that's His job, so give Him to do that job.

296
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:13,167
But we shouldn't go on doing the mistakes.

297
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:18,747
Once we're blessed by Him, let us enjoy.

298
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:25,627
Now many scientists say that there is no God - I think it's very unscientific to say that.

299
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,447
A scientist must have an open mind.

300
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:35,767
If he doesn't have an open mind, he's not a scientist at all.

301
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:39,667
He has not known anything about God, how does he say there's no God.

302
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:47,467
You may say that the way religion is followed, is wrong - I agree there.

303
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:54,567
The way they make money in the name of God, is wrong - I agree there - but there is God.

304
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:05,807
Definitely there is God - keep your minds open like a scientist and also,

305
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:15,447
what I say is a hypothesis to you - tomorrow it will become a law and you'll be amazed

306
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:22,267
the laws of God's love are so definite,

307
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:30,967
unchangeable, they work so beautifully. For example, when you get your realization

308
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:37,507
you feel the cool breeze on top of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around your fingers.

309
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:46,587
These fingers tell you - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

310
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,827
seven centers that are within you - which one is catching.

311
00:40:54,567 --> 00:41:01,087
Is said so - Mohammad Sahab has said, "Your hands will tell you,

312
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:06,027
they will speak at the time of your resurrection."

313
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:14,667
Your fingers tell you what's wrong with you, they will tell you what's wrong with another person.

314
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:24,787
And that's absolute - all those who're realized will say the same thing.

315
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:35,447
What's wrong with this country, what's wrong with that country, and you can verify it.

316
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:43,947
It's very easy to verify whether it's the truth or not.

317
00:41:44,187 --> 00:41:49,427
Supposing you want to ask a question, "Is there God?" - You'll get tremendous vibrations.

318
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:55,287
If you say, "Is Freud was a good man?" - You'll get blisters, maybe.

319
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:07,187
So, it is within you, just to reach that point where you become so sensitive

320
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:13,067
that you can say what is what and you can verify,

321
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:20,467
and you can correct yourself, you can diagnose yourself, you can treat yourself, you can treat others,

322
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:26,827
you can help the whole world. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten many lights -

323
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:30,607
that's how it is going to work out.

324
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:37,187
Yesterday we spent a lot of time asking questions.

325
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:44,747
Today if you want, you can ask but not too many and sensible questions will be better

326
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:54,387
because I'm not here for election. They ask me questions as if I'm standing for some election or asking for goods from you.

327
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:59,447
I have come here to give you what is yours

328
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:06,287
- nothing to take.

329
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:18,007
[INAUDIBLE]

330
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:26,247
[INAUDIBLE]

331
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:34,027
I will, little later we'll do that, that's good. Listening to Me you may not, may some people maybe but you will be.

332
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:41,007
I'm happy that you're anxious to get the enlightenment - it's correct, very correct attitude.

333
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:48,747
Does it, does it matter if you're following another teaching?

334
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,567
Depends on.

335
00:43:53,967 --> 00:44:00,647
You see, if you're following the teachings which are against natural things, naturally

336
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:09,287
how can you judge - let us see on Kundalini. Kundalini immediately indicates

337
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:18,187
All right? If you're following a wrong person then it indicates immediately

338
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:26,067
and then you better give up, all right, in that case. Whatever is good for you, you should take it.

339
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:34,247
There have been horrible people in this world, I must confess.

340
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:41,367
I'm very sorry, so many have been Indians who came around spoiling the name of India.

341
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:48,827
I don't know what to say and taking full advantage

342
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:55,147
of your ignorance about this knowledge.

343
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:06,427
Uh.. I have to just say one thing, that you must give a full test

344
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:12,707
of these people - take a full understanding - how?

345
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:20,687
For example, if somebody is here and says, "You pay five hundred rupees or five hundred dollars

346
00:45:21,627 --> 00:45:29,507
for just seeing my face," - you better never see such a face again. [LAUGHTER]

347
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:38,247
Or that, "There is some technique which I'll teach you." There is no technique for living things.

348
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:42,027
It's already built-in, it works out by itself.

349
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:48,467
Or anybody who says, "There's a course you have to go through," - there is no course.

350
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:54,427
What is a course of a tree that is growing -  do you give a course to that tree?

351
00:45:54,627 --> 00:46:00,347
All right, you have five days' course - [LAUGHTER] It will grow despite everything.

352
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,987
Then,

353
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:14,887
you cannot take any money in the name of God.

354
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:23,787
You cannot live on the earnings in the name of God.

355
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:35,547
We don't believe in priesthoods in sahaja yoga. You have to do your normal work

356
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:40,067
you have to be married, you must have children, you must live like normal people

357
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:43,287
and be spiritually developed.

358
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:49,187
We don't have all these systems that people had

359
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:55,027
where we become a priest and you pay them money - the priest is taking money and living on that.

360
00:46:55,687 --> 00:47:00,667
God has nothing to do with money, He actually doesn't understand any money.

361
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:11,627
If you put only this test, then most of them will be finished.

362
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:22,807
We may say, how are they to live? They should live by, as they have been living.

363
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:28,327
They can teach in the school, they can sell things in the market, do what they like.

364
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:35,567
What is the need to take money?

365
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:44,127
Now for Me, I must say, luckily in this lifetime, I have

366
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:50,167
a good husband and we're well off but still

367
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:56,647
if these boys want to pay, say, for My travelling they can pay to the travel agent, not to Me.

368
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:09,147
If they give Me any presents, I can return them sweetly, something of the same kind or better.

369
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:14,147
But there should not be any greed.

370
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,007
Sometimes you feel like giving flowers - all right, then I must also return it.

371
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:27,247
All matter has this value is to

372
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:37,847
gives and communicate your feelings to another - that's the only thing a matter can do

373
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:44,907
and that's what we should utilize it for.

374
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:58,207
So this ghost of materialism will drop out. It's a ghost, I tell you and it's growing bigger and bigger.

375
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:06,847
I won't be surprised after some time people won't have their hair, won't have their teeth, won't have their ears left.

376
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:14,447
Because all kinds of things they tell you to do to your hair, all kinds of things they tell you to do to your face -

377
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,667
I mean, it's going on and on and on.

378
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:25,107
The kind of food we have to eat, God knows whether we are to eating plastic or polyester. [LAUGHTER]

379
00:49:28,347 --> 00:49:34,107
Everything becoming uh.. materialistic. With sahaja yoga

380
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:40,927
you can transform non-hybrid seeds for such

381
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:49,107
great germination power that they can produce crops better than hybrid - this we have experimented.

382
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:02,867
What's this question there? Somebody was asking.

383
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,787
It's gone away or what?

384
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:12,407
- All right.
- Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

385
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:19,347
Can you speak out, it's raining outside, we can't hear?

386
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:28,967
- She tends to sleep twelve to fourteen hours a day, she said that
- She sleeps a lot
- sleeps a lot

387
00:50:29,347 --> 00:50:35,747
You're left sided, that's all - we'll work it out, all right. It's very simple to give a balance to yourself.

388
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:44,147
That's simple. You're a left sided person, that's why you sleep more.

389
00:50:54,247 --> 00:51:00,107
- Can, can somebody stand up and say things?
- He's asking the question
- Is he?

390
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:09,247
[INAUDIBLE AND UNCLEAR]

391
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:32,947
Mother, may Your Holiness explain us

392
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:41,027
whether there is a difference between a knowledge, a steady wisdom and Self- realization?

393
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:46,887
If there is a difference in what aspect do they differ?

394
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:53,167
- What is the difference between Self-realization and knowledge?
- It's just the same.
- And

395
00:51:53,727 --> 00:52:00,387
No difference. You see in the Vedas it is written Vid - Vid is the word used in Sanskrit language -

396
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:03,667
means to know on your Central Nervous System.

397
00:52:04,047 --> 00:52:10,347
Whatever is known on your Central Nervous System is the knowledge, the rest of it is just

398
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:15,267
'Shabd Pandityam' means only the word, the words.

399
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:21,207
Words and words. Whatever you know on your Central Nervous System is the Knowledge.

400
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:24,747
the rest of it is just talking, talking, talking.

401
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:38,587
What's it? - [UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE]

402
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:41,887
Knowledge, wisdom and Self-realization.

403
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:49,887
Huh.. Now, Knowledge - When you have knowledge you get wisdom automatically - is a result of that, all right?

404
00:52:59,947 --> 00:53:05,447
- What is it yet?
-  [UNCLEAR] he wants to be detached

405
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:12,427
Yes, by, by realization you become detached and then you become wise.

406
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:19,067
All right. By Self-realization you automatically become detached

407
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:23,427
and you develop a witness state and that's how you become wise.

408
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:28,647
All right, now let others say.

409
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:34,747
These are half-read Indians. Haan, what's it?

410
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:47,627
- Yes, My child.
- I have a question about re-birthing and whether that is an advanced technique, it's very common nowadays.

411
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:55,347
- [UNCLEAR] re-birthing
- Annh?
- Re-birthing, the technique of re-birthing

412
00:53:55,687 --> 00:54:00,207
It's the technique that's being solved in, in example in Sydney

413
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:06,507
- What it is?
- It's a technique where people are made to re-live their birth

414
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:15,267
- That's the vogue, that's the fashion?
- The fashion.
- What is that?

415
00:54:15,547 --> 00:54:22,887
A technique called re-birthing where people pay money and they made to re-live their birth

416
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:29,947
their actual physical birth to clear any sub-conscious', sub-conscious blocks that are there in the system.

417
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:33,347
She wants to know that's an advanced...
