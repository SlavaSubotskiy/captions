1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:10,144
There are in these modern times, many seekers
of truth.

2
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:16,465
It's a special category of people born in
these modern times.

3
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:27,455
Perhaps we are not aware that in every country,
a lot of people are born with this seeking.

4
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:39,385
They are a special category which, sees beyond,
tries to find something beyond, what they

5
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:44,524
can perceive through their sense organs.

6
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:51,984
The truth as we see, is through our sense
organs.

7
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:58,315
For example something we see as white, we
call it white, something we feel cool, we

8
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:08,245
call it cold, something as hot, means whatever
we perceive through our sense organs and whatever

9
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,145
is communicated to us through our central
nervous system we accept as truth, and we

10
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:19,105
should accept that only, as truth.

11
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:28,014
And not something that is told to us, not
something that we have read in the books,

12
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:33,885
not something that we can project our mind
to, and then .......................that does

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:38,985
not mean that I deny any one of the scriptures.

14
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:44,165
That does not mean that I deny anything that
we have known so far.

15
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:53,224
But to begin with let us start from scratch
as they call it or a clean slate.

16
00:01:53,224 --> 00:01:57,095
Let us see what is the truth.

17
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:01,114
Now in every religion truth has been described.

18
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:08,655
As I can see it, everybody does not see it
themselves.....................That's why

19
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:17,854
there's blindness, that's why there are these
blind alleys where you end up, arguing things.

20
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:25,935
So there must be something that is missing
within us, that we have not been able to really

21
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:32,505
relate truth to our central nervous system.

22
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:39,375
And what is that missing within us, we should
find out.

23
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,384
In all humility we should know that there
must be something within us, that we have

24
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:50,164
been arguing about so many things, we have
been talking about so many things, reading

25
00:02:50,164 --> 00:03:00,405
so many books, going into all kinds of funny
experiences, right from alcohol to other drugs

26
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:07,225
and Gurus and this and that, but still we
have not felt anything on our central nervous

27
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,524
system.

28
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:13,405
Secondly that we have no control over that
truth.

29
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:17,155
So, so what is the reason?

30
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,914
Is it there is something missing in the human
awareness?

31
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:28,565
Is it that we are lacking something in our
human awareness?

32
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:34,175
All the books, all the scriptures, which are
true scriptures have said one thing, that

33
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:38,055
to know the truth, you are to be born again.

34
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:41,005
That's not only in the bible.

35
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:47,664
You see if you take Patanjali which is a very
ancient book, it's not that the Patanjali

36
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:53,315
asked you to stand on your heads, is wrong,
it's just a wee, wee, wee, wee bit of it.

37
00:03:53,315 --> 00:04:01,194
But what Patanjali has written is that you
have to achieve the truth on your central

38
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:07,414
nervous system through your ATMASAKSHAT, the
word is written, meaning the experience of

39
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,685
your SPIRIT.

40
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:18,355
Now English language has an advantage and
a disadvantage, that the spirit could be alcohol,

41
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:21,475
the spirit could be an alcohol!

42
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:27,704
Or spirit could be a dead body, it could be
any circumstance, but it is not so.

43
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:34,125
There are three separate things, absolutely
opposite to each other.

44
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:42,726
So the ATMA the SPIRIT has to be found out,
is said even by Mohammed Sahib, he said you

45
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:48,685
are to become the PIR, is said by.

46
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:53,645
Zoroaster, is said by Loa Tse, is also said
by Zen.

47
00:04:53,645 --> 00:05:01,785
Buddha has said it, Mahavira has said it,
everyone of them has said it, so many religions

48
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:11,525
have started in the name of God without going
to the truth, that you have to be born again.

49
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:17,764
Now you have to be born again does mean that
you certify yourself 'I am born again'.

50
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:23,155
Self certificate, you can call it 'I am born
again', but you don't become.

51
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:30,065
What is so special if you are born again,
what should be so?

52
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:36,435
The human awareness at this level is just
ready to be born again.

53
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:49,104
Now in Sanskrit the word for a bird is DWIJAHA,
means born again, and also for a Brahmin who

54
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:50,755
is born again.

55
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:53,585
But those who call themselves Brahmins are
not Brahmins.

56
00:05:53,585 --> 00:06:00,285
They just call themselves Brahmins, have they
come to know the Brahma, the all pervading

57
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:01,574
power of God.

58
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:07,915
Those who say they are born again, should
feel the all pervading power of God around

59
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:10,615
them, if they cannot feel it they are not
born again.

60
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:16,765
So all these self certificates are deception,
self deception and deception of others, is

61
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:20,405
just a money making process.

62
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:28,195
So the truth has to be achieved through your
evolutionary process which is a living process.

63
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:32,085
Again we must understand a LIVING process.

64
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:36,545
Not you just talking, mental projections,
just sitting down here big talk about it,

65
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:41,195
or by giving you some courses, or taking some
money from you.

66
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:54,745
You cannot get it, it's a STATE in a living
growth, that proves that it is a living thing.

67
00:06:54,745 --> 00:07:01,104
Means the state of our awareness has to be
higher than what it is.

68
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:08,544
If our state cannot rise then it is not of
any use.

69
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:20,365
Like the seed becomes the roots then the bark,
the leaves, the flowers then the fruit.

70
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,324
Different states.

71
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:28,424
In the same way a living religion must give
you a different state and that nucleus of

72
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:31,924
religion is within ourselves.

73
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:35,255
Everyone of us has it.

74
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:41,335
When we go against that living religion within
us we go into imbalances.

75
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:47,194
But even today people can ask why the religion,
why should we have a balance, what is the

76
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:52,155
need, lets go into imbalances, I mean, is
that a logical question.

77
00:07:52,155 --> 00:08:05,354
People can ask why the religion, why has the
religion in the stomach..........................so

78
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,755
what is the religion we come to that point,
is that, a religion is a valency of human

79
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:07,755
beings.

80
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:14,294
Just like carbon has four valences human beings
have ten valences, which matter does not have.

81
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,465
Animals have nine and human beings have ten
valences.

82
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:27,044
And when these ten valences go out of balance
then, they go out of the quality of a human

83
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,775
being.

84
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:36,305
But still one can ask why do we have those
ten valences.

85
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:44,355
Because we have to ascend, because in the
evolutionary process you have to ascend and

86
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:49,595
you can never be satisfied with yourself unless
and until you have achieved it.

87
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:56,825
Especially the seekers, that's why I say they
are the special category because in this special

88
00:08:56,825 --> 00:09:05,815
category men of God will have to become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophets,

89
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:08,565
said by William Blake.

90
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:12,255
In your great country William Blake has said
it.

91
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,075
When is that going to happen?

92
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:20,415
It has to happen today, tonight.

93
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:34,135
But there are barriers within us, built in,
not because of anything else but only because

94
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:38,765
we have misled ourselves.

95
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:51,275
We have been going to various roads of seeking,
whatever suited us, where ever we went to,

96
00:09:51,275 --> 00:10:02,115
we have tried to...............and we have
insured ourselves within ourselves sometimes,

97
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:06,115
we have built up certain barriers.

98
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:22,375
Now when you become the prophet, actually
become your own master, become a free person,

99
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,695
you have to be a free person.

100
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:28,735
So far you are not.

101
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:43,295
You cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your
own temptations, infatuations, emotional problems,

102
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,935
mental worries -- why?

103
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:55,195
Because you are still standing in the waves
of this turmoil.

104
00:10:55,195 --> 00:11:07,185
This troubled area where you just see the
waves all the time and you are frightened

105
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:15,235
of breaking down, but if you somehow or other
get out of it and get into the boat of your

106
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:22,205
own being, then you enjoy, you become a witness
a Sakshi.

107
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:29,745
Even to understand the scriptures, you have
to become a free person, which you are not.

108
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:34,645
You have to be your own master, for that you
cannot pay.

109
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:43,325
I am too free, that I cannot accept it.

110
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:50,655
To get your freedom of Spirit you can't pay,
because money is money.

111
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,595
Money has no value in the Divine field.

112
00:11:53,595 --> 00:12:00,115
Nothing can bring forth this but your own
ascent.

113
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:03,025
And how do we ascend?

114
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,615
Is there anything built within us?

115
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:15,995
So what ever I am telling you today is the
knowledge of the roots.

116
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:22,496
What we see is the knowledge of the tree.

117
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:30,515
We see it from outside, we see a leaf from
out side, if we have to treat the leaf, we

118
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,325
have to go to the roots.

119
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:39,735
But from outside, when we see the tree we
are still outside also.

120
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:45,405
When you have to treat the leaf, you have
to go to the roots, if you block out the leaf,

121
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:46,405
it is dead.

122
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:52,075
Then you put it under the microscope, you
can go on seeing cells after that you can

123
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:58,195
see the nucleus, you can go on analysing it,
and analysing it making it dead, and dead

124
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,465
and dead.

125
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:04,495
But to treat it you have to go to the roots.

126
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:09,105
And this knowledge of roots we have here.

127
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:13,185
There's nothing wrong in knowing something
new.

128
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:22,545
These are not new ideas, these are ancient
ideas, very ancient ideas.

129
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:26,705
In the Bible it is described as the Holy Ghost.

130
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:32,165
One priest was asked I saw ......................a
very narrow minded priest, what do you know

131
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,425
about Holy Ghost?

132
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:37,135
He said "I am agnostic".

133
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,865
So then they said, what are you doing here?

134
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:43,875
He said "I am doing my job".

135
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:51,095
If that is the attitude towards God, towards
your inner knowledge, then you can never reach

136
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:57,145
there as you cannot reach the tree through
the leaf, you have to go to the roots.

137
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:07,035
This has been available only to seers, like
you can say William Blake.

138
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:14,785
Like we had many in other countries, but they
did not talk about it because perhaps that

139
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:19,365
was not the time for people to know.

140
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:29,075
But in many languages it is described.

141
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:38,225
Now the roots within us, if you can see this,
are placed in this manner.

142
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:49,095
When I went to America the Indian society
invited me to talk to them about the unconscious.

143
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:54,205
I had never read Jung, though I knew he was
a realised soul at least he got his realization

144
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,805
at the later time.

145
00:14:55,805 --> 00:15:02,805
So I said all right let me have a look, let
me see .............theory, say, and as I

146
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:11,755
opened the book I saw a diagram, what he had
drawn of a human being and I said that's the

147
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:14,335
mistake.

148
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:20,985
Because he saw human beings from outside and
he described them in layers, like first he

149
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:28,375
said is the unconscious that cannot be expressed,
manifested then the unconscious that can be

150
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:34,415
manifested, then he said about at least the
sub-conscious and then he said above that

151
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:39,175
is the conscious mind, then above that is
the ego.

152
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:44,075
Like layers, one after another.

153
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:57,415
Now when you are sitting here, though you
are in layers the path is laid down.

154
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:07,715
In the same way within us, God being the greatest
organiser, he has not made us into layers

155
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:15,855
but what he has made us in a parallel way,
as you can see there very clearly.

156
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:18,965
Left side and right side.

157
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:33,005
Left side and right side, the central path,
three paths he has made within us, for our

158
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,645
evolutionary process.

159
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,545
The central path works out our evolution.

160
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:47,605
The left side gives us the desire and the
right side gives us the power of action.

161
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:54,105
These are just the principles I am telling
you but you can understand it slowly when

162
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:58,025
you grow, all the details of it.

163
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:08,715
The central path is evolution, has brought
you today to this level of human awareness.

164
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:20,445
Now beyond that is a very short ascent which
you have to achieve; by which you become the

165
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:22,235
Spirit.

166
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:27,875
But there has to be some living process for
this to happen.

167
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:35,215
And what is that living process built within
us, is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within

168
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:41,725
us in the triangular bone, which is called
as Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

169
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:52,695
This exists within us, and you can see with
your naked eyes, sometimes, in some people

170
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:59,905
where there is an obstruction in the higher
centres, it starts pulsating.

171
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:08,745
And when we can sense, we can also see it
clearly in some people when it is obstructing.

172
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:18,405
Or through your stethoscope you can feel the
percussion which we call as anahat at the

173
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:27,045
top of the head here, where it pulsates and
then it breaks.

174
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:33,465
When this breaks the pulsation stops and you
start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy

175
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:37,755
Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area.

176
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:47,655
This is a happening and not ..............................in
the sense that the happening takes place so

177
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:51,485
that you get connected with the truth.

178
00:18:51,485 --> 00:19:00,105
So the connection takes place and you start
feeling on your finger tips the cool breeze

179
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,045
of the Holy Ghost which surrounds you.

180
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:05,945
Actually, you start feeling.

181
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,795
But then as the rational mind says so what!

182
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:14,585
Though we feel the cool breeze, so what?

183
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:21,585
Then one should know, that when we have eyes
we start seeing, when we have ears we start

184
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:27,665
hearing, so now you have got a new awareness,
what is this awareness?

185
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:34,645
This is the awareness of collective consciousness,
that you become, again I say you become, you

186
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:41,405
are not just certified but you become, it's
a question of becoming, that you become collectively

187
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:42,405
conscious.

188
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:50,825
That on your central nervous system you can
feel another person, you can feel yourself,

189
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:56,015
you can feel your centres which are shown
here, you can feel the centres of others on

190
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,015
your fingertips.

191
00:19:57,015 --> 00:20:02,465
And the best one is, is Mohammed Sahib, I
would say because he made it clear, at the

192
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:09,125
time of resurrection your hands will speak.

193
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,155
But who talks about the resurrection?

194
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:12,155
Nowhere!

195
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:16,795
People talk about it, they talk about the
doomsday, because they can frighten people

196
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:22,055
of the doomsday first, and take advantage
of it and make money out of it.

197
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:31,505
God who has made this universe, he feels love,
do you think he will destroy this great creation

198
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:41,595
of his without giving us the fruit, without
letting us know the fruit of his creation.

199
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:47,635
He is the wisest of wise.

200
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:59,115
The greatest compassionate source of love,
how could he allow this universe to be destroyed,

201
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:08,385
especially this Earth, which is a special
present from him.

202
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:22,435
So don't believe in all these stupid ideas
of destruction and the last complete devastation.

203
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:30,065
Still lot of plans, you are suppose to enjoy
the blessings of the Divine for which he has

204
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:31,655
created you.

205
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:39,055
So the experience of truth has to be felt
on the central nervous system.

206
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:52,425
The problem is, not that you belong, you may
feel, but as you know the experience is very

207
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,465
slow in the western countries.

208
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:59,875
I am sorry, not that you are in any way less
seekers, you are very great seekers, I would

209
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,895
say you are greater seekers than the Indians
are, much greater seekers.

210
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:11,285
Indians have still a lot of steps to come
up to your level, no doubt, but while coming

211
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:17,005
up to this level, you have developed a lot
of problems around and that's why the seeking

212
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:31,495
is sometimes, takes time to express itself
as a fruitful gain of Self Realization.

213
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:36,885
So you'll get your self realization no doubt
but again the Kundalini goes down.

214
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:45,235
I must tell you very frankly, because I cannot
be dishonest, but it can be brought up, by

215
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:48,735
you, by understanding how to work it out.

216
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:56,975
By co-operating with your self, by understanding
your self, that you are the temple of God

217
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:06,955
and that you have to work it out with respect
to yourself, and you have to give some time.

218
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:13,965
I mean in Caxton Hall, you must have seen
there, thousands of people have got it.

219
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:22,905
I have been working in this England for twelve
years now, twelve years, is the last year

220
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,005
now.

221
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:30,215
Special reason for that, but what I find,
people get their realization and then they're

222
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:31,295
lost.

223
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:35,685
Then when they have some disease or something,
they'll telephone to me Mother, now I am.............

224
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:47,855
has happened or I am suffering from cancer...........................is
too far gone a case, but if you know how to

225
00:23:47,855 --> 00:24:00,365
handle your roots, how to nourish it, how
to look after it, then you flower out, you

226
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:05,955
bear fruits, and by your fruits people know
what it is.

227
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:10,535
Then you become trees, giant trees, like moving
trees.

228
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:18,115
And when people come under such trees, get
realization.

229
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:24,245
English are a great people no doubt, they
are placed in a country which is the heart

230
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:27,995
of the universe, you are very important.

231
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:36,435
I have given the maximum time to England,
you'll be amazed, maximum time.

232
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:46,146
But the Sahaja Yogis who are not in the country
have grown much faster than in England.

233
00:24:46,146 --> 00:25:01,865
The reason is, it's like the foundation that
always gets (damp in it) you are the ..................................................foundation.

234
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:08,285
Remove the darkness, again it gets dark.

235
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:10,285
Rather difficult!

236
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:23,835
But once they are settled, you will be circulating
the Divine interpretation, the Divine experience

237
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:25,675
of truth all over the world.

238
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:31,575
You are like the hard-core and this is what
you have to do.

239
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:39,775
We cannot be mediocre in Sahaja Yoga.

240
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:46,315
There is no compromise with your self, you
become so powerful that you don't compromise

241
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:50,755
also, you can just get out of everything in
no time.

242
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:55,155
But you must accept yourself first of all,
have faith in yourself.

243
00:25:55,155 --> 00:26:00,615
Once upon a time the English had too much
faith in themselves, I mean extraordinarily

244
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:04,815
powerful people, now they are the other way
around, they have no faith.

245
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:09,125
You see now this darkness has come and ....the
darkness has come ...................thrown

246
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,125
out.

247
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:16,015
This is the second phase that I find is complete
lethargy.

248
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:23,565
Oh what can happen, let us be destroyed Mother,
now that's the best part, completely reconciled

249
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:26,065
to our doom.

250
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:32,725
Now how to get them to be creative?

251
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,765
We have to circulate.

252
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:47,515
They are the cells, who are like in the heart,
who have to pump the heart...............................

253
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:54,785
So I have to make a humble request, that I
know experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow but

254
00:26:54,785 --> 00:27:05,175
very steady and I am sure that today I have
got people who are a rare quality of courage.

255
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:13,915
And as individual which was the English character,
once upon a time, and that they will take

256
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:19,495
it up seriously, their ascent and the ascent
of the whole world.

257
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:25,594
We'll be having about three more lectures
and there I will tell you more elaborately

258
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:30,505
about Kundalini and the Chakras, about all
this knowledge.

259
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:33,565
All this knowledge is available to you.

260
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:42,865
Now, because this time was for you to know
all these secrets.

261
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:48,195
Some newspaper people asked me, Mother have
you got your disciples all very big scholars,

262
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:51,145
I said no, they are very ordinary people.

263
00:27:51,145 --> 00:28:02,275
Some may be, they are more difficult, but
mostly they are very normal, ordinary people.

264
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:05,075
Simple people.

265
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:07,405
But what makes you think that?

266
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:14,995
They said they are so scholarly they know
so much, because you become the knowledge.

267
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:21,105
So truth is the knowledge, the rest of it
is all mythical.

268
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:28,075
Is mythical, what do we know about things
is all mythical, because what ever we see

269
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:32,235
from outside, is outside.

270
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:44,135
Like I would say we appreciate Mona Lisa,
we appreciate the miracles as we say, the

271
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:47,975
great miracles that human beings have created.

272
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,485
Why?

273
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,875
Why do we call them miracles?

274
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:58,545
Sometimes we think that we have observed a
very miraculous task, they are, mentally we

275
00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,545
think.

276
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:03,594
But actually it is not so.

277
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:10,625
Because they have vibrations, they have Divine
vibrations, they emit vibrations and they

278
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:17,775
appeal to you because in your heart lies that
Spirit, which is the universal being and which

279
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:28,825
gives that feeling of bewilderment when you
see these great miracles human beings have

280
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:31,655
created.

281
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:37,085
At least I have seen six of them, and all
of them have tremendous vibrations.

282
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:43,235
But unless and until you become a realised
soul, how will you know?

283
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:49,365
(silence)
Now this is the only .............. and to

284
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:58,616
become the realised soul you have to have
the ascent of the Kundalini and proper state

285
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:13,795
of that Kundalini to remain there and that's
the point where I found we lack in the efforts.

286
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:22,505
Lack in courage, in patience, so again and
again I request you that don't be superficial.

287
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:26,455
The Americans were superficial, you better
not be.

288
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:34,295
You be solid people, serious, take it up seriously.

289
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:43,065
Because you are going to be the Europeans,
the Americans even the Greeks, even the Italians,

290
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:53,155
the problem is the horse is behind the cart.........................but
what do I do, prove to the horse, that you

291
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:58,015
get up now because of you the cart is not
moving.

292
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:05,105
That's why ...........very very special ..........to
see you all, that you must decide that if

293
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:09,395
we get our Realization, we'll establish ourselves
into Sahaja Yoga.

294
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:12,964
For which you don't have to pay, there's no
membership, there's no organisation, nothing.

295
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:25,455
I have nothing to take from you.

296
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:33,575
You can't give me.

297
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:39,945
So I hope today, many who are new will get
their Realization and establish themselves

298
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:42,075
and will not forget it.

299
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:46,625
Because in the beginning the experience is
very great, you feel like you are coming out

300
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,535
of a pub.

301
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:57,405
I don't know what that experience is, must
be that way (laughter) because I've seen so

302
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:06,344
many people coming and falling down and again
going in, must be some memory of something

303
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:12,695
great, must be that.

304
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:22,095
So by God's grace you should all get your
Realization and I would like to have some

305
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:28,415
questions, but in that I would like to say
that there are people I know, we have had

306
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:33,646
before also, belonging to some gurus or something
big, like some gurus have come too, because

307
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:39,575
you see they feel, the gurus are feeling that
I may been attacking them; in a way, they

308
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:47,725
feel that way because I say you cannot pay,
so their profession is finished.

309
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:52,565
So they get angry with me for that, so they
might be saying they are in .................and

310
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:58,895
attack her and all sorts of things and there
could be some people who are aggressive because

311
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:04,995
of other problems of ego or something.

312
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:11,005
So you need not be aggressive, I have come
here to give you what you have and you need

313
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:16,165
not be also docile about it or slavish.

314
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:24,075
I have come here to give you or tell you what
is free.

315
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:29,714
Now you may also say, it is a very common
question that arises in your mind, and justified,

316
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:37,415
that why should I do it, now that's the miserable
part of it, that I have to do it, I wish you

317
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:42,155
could do it, but you can't that's the problem.

318
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,815
And if I have to do it, I don't hurt your
ego.

319
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,095
No!

320
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:49,035
I don't want to hurt it.

321
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:58,084
You see this is something people don't understand,
that why should I do it.

322
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:05,775
You can do it also, but first I have to take
you little bit............your awareness has

323
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:13,305
to grow a little more, then you can do it
your way, but first definitely, I have to

324
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:14,674
do that.

325
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:20,164
Which is a .........it makes me also a miserable
person because............you know...........a

326
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:23,904
thankless job, but I have to do it.

327
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:31,275
Maybe I am doing it for it somehow, I don't
know...........but it should be............It's

328
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:43,396
a crucifixion, I tell you, it's not easy,
it's a very difficult task.

329
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:49,045
It's like mountains sometimes, the Kundalini
is just embedded, poor thing sometimes so

330
00:34:49,045 --> 00:35:00,455
hurt, so wounded that to raise that Kundalini
itself takes such a load, effort.

331
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:03,455
But one has to do it and I know

332
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,781
I have to do it.

333
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:09,067
When you will know

334
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:11,361
what it is, you will not

335
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:14,242
be angry with me, but

336
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:18,109
you will understand the task and .............all
of us, all

337
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:21,134
of us have to do it.

338
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,665
May God Bless You.
