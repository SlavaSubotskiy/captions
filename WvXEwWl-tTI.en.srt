00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,067
Public Program, “The Experience of Truth”. South Bank Polytechnic, London (England), 22 June 1984.

2
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:03,400
There are in those modern times,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,367
many seekers of Truth [that] are born.

4
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:13,167
It’s a special category of people

5
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:16,467
born in these modern times.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:22,200
Perhaps we are not aware that, in every country,

7
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:27,267
[a] lot of people are born with the seeking.

8
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:35,534
They are a special category which sees beyond,

9
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,300
tries to find something beyond

10
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:44,367
what they can perceive through their sense organs.

11
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:51,300
The Truth as we see, is through our sense organs.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,400
For example something we see as white, we call it ‘white’,

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,400
something we feel cool, we call it ‘cool’; something as hot.

14
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:06,267
Means, whatever we perceive through our sense organs and

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,267
whatever is communicated to us through our central nervous system

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,300
we accept as Truth. And we should accept that only as Truth

17
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:23,534
and not something that is told to us,

18
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:27,234
not something that we have read in the books,

19
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:32,467
not something that we can project our mind to and can think about.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,300
That doesn’t mean that I deny any one of the scriptures.

21
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:43,500
That doesn’t mean that I deny anything that you have known so far.

22
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:48,467
But, to begin with, let us start from

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,667
scratch as they call it or on a clean slate.

24
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,167
Let us see what is the Truth.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Now in every religion Truth has been described as I can see it.

26
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,234
Everybody cannot see it. That’s why this problem.

27
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:10,300
That’s why fanaticism. That’s why this blindness.

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,400
That’s why there are these blind alleys where you end up arguing [about] things.

29
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:22,167
So there must be something that is missing within us that

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,167
we have not been able to really relate Truth to our central nervous system.

31
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:38,434
And what is that missing within us we should try to find out.

32
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:42,167
In all humility we should know that there must be

33
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:46,400
something within us. That we have been arguing about so many things.

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,300
We have been talking about so many things.

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,200
Reading so many books.

36
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,367
Going into all kinds of funny experiences,

37
00:02:55,367 --> 00:03:02,167
right from alcohol to other drugs and ‘gurus’ and this and that.

38
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:08,200
But still we have not felt anything on our central nervous system.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,367
Secondly that we have no control over that Truth, so far.

40
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,400
So what is the reason?

41
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:21,300
Is it that something [is] missing in the human awareness?

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Is it that we are lacking something in our human awareness?

43
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,500
All the books, all the scriptures, which are true scriptures,

44
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:35,267
have said one thing, that to know the Truth,

45
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,334
you are to be born again.

46
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,334
That’s not only in The Bible.

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,334
Say, if you take Patanjali which is a very ancient book,

48
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,267
it’s not that the Patanjali asked you to stand on your heads.

49
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:52,300
[This understanding] is wrong. It’s just a wee, wee bit of that.

50
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,200
But what Patanjali has written is that

51
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:02,267
you have to achieve the Truth on your central nervous system

52
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:04,133
through your ‘Atmasakshatkar’.

53
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:08,334
The word is different, meaning: ‘the experience of your Spirit.’

54
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,300
Now English language has an advantage and a disadvantage –

55
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:17,601
that the Spirit could be the Atma,

56
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:21,133
the spirit could be an alcohol,

57
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,334
or spirit could be a dead body.

58
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,367
But it could be a disadvantage, because it is not so.

59
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:35,267
They are three separate things. Absolutely opposite [to] each other.

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,234
So [that] the Atma, the Spirit, has to be found out,

61
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,300
is said even by Mohammed Sahib.

62
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
He said, “You have to become the pir.”

63
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:53,634
It’s said by Zoroaster, is said by Lao Tse, is also said by Zen.

64
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:57,267
Buddha has said it. Mahavira has said it.

65
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:00,067
Every one of them has said it.

66
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:05,033
So many religions have started in the name of God

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,267
without going to the Truth that – you have to be born again.

68
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,267
Now you have to be born again

69
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:18,133
does mean that you certify yourself ‘I’m born again’.

70
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:21,234
Self-certificate! You can go ahead, “I am a born again!”

71
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:25,067
But you don’t become that. What is so special if you are born again?

72
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,334
What should be so?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,234
The human awareness at this level

74
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,167
is just ready to be born again.

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,567
As in Sanskrit the word for a ‘bird’ is dwijaha – means born again.

76
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:50,234
And also for a Brahmin who is born again.

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,100
But those who call themselves Brahmins are not Brahmins.

78
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,334
They just call themselves Brahmins.

79
00:05:56,334 --> 00:06:01,601
Have they come to know the Brahma, the All-pervading Power of God.

80
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:05,100
Those who say that they are born again

81
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,167
should feel the All-pervading Power of God around them.

82
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,300
If they cannot feel it they are not born again.

83
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,400
So all this self-certificate and deception,

84
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:19,300
self-deception and deception of others, is just a money making process.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,601
So the Truth has to be achieved through your evolutionary process

86
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,601
which is a living process.

87
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,067
Again we must understand – living process.

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,267
Not through just talking [or] mental projections –

89
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:36,200
sitting down here we talk about it –

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,367
or by giving you some courses,

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,167
or taking some money from you.

92
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,367
You cannot get it [like that].

93
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:49,267
It’s a state in a living growth,

94
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,200
that proves that it is a living thing.

95
00:06:54,267 --> 00:07:00,367
Means the state of our awareness has to be higher than what it is.

96
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:08,100
If our state cannot rise then it is not of any use.

97
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:13,300
Like a seed becomes the roots then the bark,

98
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:21,300
the leaves, the flowers then the fruit – different states.

99
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:26,434
In the same way a living religion must give you a different state

100
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:30,300
and that living religion is within ourselves.

101
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,200
Everyone  has that.

102
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:39,267
When we go against that living religion within us

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,567
we go into imbalances.

104
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:45,267
But even today people can ask, “Why the religion?

105
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,500
Why should we have a balance? What is the need?

106
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,234
Let’s go into imbalances!

107
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:54,567
I mean, is a quite logical question [that] people can ask.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,234
Why have the religion in the stomach even? For what?

109
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,567
So what is the religion – we come to that point –

110
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:06,167
is that religion is the valency of human beings.

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,167
Just like carbon has four valences human beings have ten valences,

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,267
which matter does not have.

113
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:17,634
Animals have nine, while the human beings have ten valences.

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,367
And when these ten valences go out of balance

115
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,400
then they go out of the quality of a human being.

116
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,400
But still one can ask, “Why should we have those ten valences?”

117
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:38,500
Because you have to ascend.

118
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:44,033
Because in the evolutionary process you have to ascend.

119
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,167
And you can never be satisfied with yourself

120
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,300
unless and until you have achieved it.

121
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,234
Especially the seekers.

122
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:54,634
That’s why I say they are the special category.

123
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,100
Because, in this special category,

124
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:02,167
"men of God will have to become prophets,

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,367
and they will have powers to make others prophets,”

126
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:11,601
said by William Blake. In your great country William Blake has said this.

127
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:17,400
When is that going to happen? It has to happen today, tonight.

128
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,334
But there are barriers within us, built in.

129
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,400
Not because of anything else but only because we have been seekers.

130
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,167
We have been going to various roads of seeking,

131
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,133
whatever suited us.

132
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:55,300
Wherever we went to, we have tried to find something.

133
00:09:56,033 --> 00:10:02,267
And we have ensured ourselves within ourselves sometimes.

134
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:06,234
We have built up certain barriers.

135
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,667
Now when you become the prophet

136
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,033
you actually become your own master.

137
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,267
You become a free person.

138
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:27,534
You have to be a free person. So far you are not.

139
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,334
You cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your own temptations,

140
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:46,400
infatuations, emotional problems, mental worries. Why?

141
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:53,033
Because you are still standing in the waves of this turmoil,

142
00:10:53,267 --> 00:11:05,400
this troubled area where you just see the waves all the time

143
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,601
and you are frightened of getting drowned.

144
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,367
But if you somehow or other get out of it

145
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:16,267
and get into the boat of your own being,

146
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:21,234
then you enjoy, you become the witness, the sakshi.

147
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:26,534
Even to understand the scriptures you have to be a free person,

148
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,667
which you are not.

149
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,734
You have to be your own master.

150
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,567
For that you cannot pay.

151
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:39,400
I am too free that I cannot accept anything.

152
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,667
To get your freedom of Spirit you can’t pay

153
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,300
because money is binding.

154
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:53,734
Money has no value in the Divine field!

155
00:11:54,434 --> 00:12:00,300
Nothing can bring forth this but your own ascent.

156
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,767
And how do we ascend? Is there anything built within us?

157
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:15,067
So whatever I am telling you today is the knowledge of the roots.

158
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:21,467
What we see is the knowledge of the tree.

159
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,734
We see it from outside.

160
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,167
We see a leaf from outside.

161
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:32,234
If you have to treat the leaf we have to go to the roots.

162
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:36,267
But from outside, when we see the tree

163
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,634
we are still outside the tree.

164
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,434
When you have to treat the leaf, you have to go to the roots.

165
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,400
If you pluck out the leaf, it is dead.

166
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,400
Then [if] you put it under the microscope

167
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,334
you can go on seeing cells after that you can see the nucleus.

168
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:56,167
You can go on analysing it, and analysing it making it dead,

169
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,467
dead and dead and dead.

170
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,601
But to treat it you have to go to the roots.

171
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,133
And this knowledge of roots we have to know.

172
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:12,400
There’s nothing wrong in knowing something new.

173
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,200
These are not new ideas.

174
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:22,100
These are ancient ideas. Very ancient ideas.

175
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:26,167
In The Bible it is described as The Holy Ghost.

176
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,167
One priest was asked, I saw, on the television.

177
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,267
A very high ranking priest, “What do you know about Holy Ghost?”

178
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,400
He said, “I am agnostic.”

179
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:39,267
So then they said, “Then what are you doing here?”

180
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,234
He said, “I am doing my job!”

181
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:49,267
If that is the attitude towards God, towards your inner knowledge,

182
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,234
then you can never reach there,

183
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:54,701
as you cannot reach the tree through the leaf –

184
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,267
you have to go to the roots.

185
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
This has been available only to seers

186
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,267
like, you can say, William Blake.

187
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:10,601
Like we had many in other countries.

188
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,367
But they did not talk about it because perhaps

189
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,167
that was not the time for people to know.

190
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:26,167
But in many languages it is described.

191
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:35,133
Now the roots within us, if you can see this (chakra chart),

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,567
are placed in this manner.

193
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:44,667
When I went to America the Jungian Society invited me

194
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:48,601
to talk to them about the unconscious.

195
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,300
I had never read Jung,

196
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,267
though I knew he was a realised-soul,

197
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,267
at least he got his realisation at the later time.

198
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,367
So I said, “Alright let me have one book,

199
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,734
let me see what is he saying about it, see.”

200
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,734
And as I opened the book I saw a diagram,

201
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,267
what he had drawn of a human being

202
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:13,234
and I said, “That’s the mistake.”

203
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,467
Because he saw human beings from outside

204
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:19,234
and he described them in layers.

205
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:25,100
Like first he said is the unconscious that cannot be expressed,

206
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,400
manifested, then the unconscious that can be manifested,

207
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,167
then he said above that is the sub-conscious.

208
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:36,267
And then he said above that is the conscious mind.

209
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,701
Then above that is the ego. Like layers, one after another.

210
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:49,434
Now when you are sitting here, though you are in layers,

211
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:55,467
the path is laid down vertically (the path between the chairs in the hall).

212
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:03,500
In the same way within us, God being the greatest organiser,

213
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:07,634
He has not made us into layers

214
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,334
but what he has made us [is] in a parallel way,

215
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,167
as you can see there very clearly –

216
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:18,234
left side and right side.

217
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,701
Left side and right side [and] the central path.

218
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:34,267
Three paths He has made within us for our evolutionary process.

219
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:38,167
The central path works out our evolution.

220
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:42,200
The left side gives us the desire

221
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:47,234
and the right side gives us the power of action.

222
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,167
These are just the principles I am telling you.

223
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:57,434
But you can understand, slowly, when you grow, all the details about it.

224
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:02,534
The central path of evolution has brought you, today,

225
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:07,167
to this level of human awareness.

226
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:17,567
Now beyond that is a very short ascent, which you have to achieve,

227
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,167
by which you become the Spirit.

228
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:27,267
But there has to be some living process for this to happen.

229
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,601
And what is that living process built within us?

230
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:37,300
Is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us in the triangular bone,

231
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,400
which is called as ‘Kundalini’ in Sanskrit language.

232
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:51,100
This exists within us. And you can see with your naked eyes,

233
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,167
sometimes, in some people, where there is an obstruction

234
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:58,400
in the higher centres, it starts pulsating.

235
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,234
And when it ascends you can also see it clearly

236
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:08,601
in some people when it is obstructed.

237
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:15,167
Or through your stethoscope you can feel the percussion –

238
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:20,000
which we call as anahatha – up to the top of the head here,

239
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:25,734
where it pulsates and then it breaks.

240
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,334
When this breaks the pulsation stops

241
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,167
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

242
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:38,167
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

243
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,601
This is the happening and not the Truth.

244
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,767
In the sense that the happening takes place

245
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,500
so that you get connected with the Truth.

246
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:55,400
So the connection takes place and you start feeling

247
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:01,100
on your fingertips the cool breeze of The Holy Ghost

248
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,567
which surrounds you.

249
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,701
Actually, you start feeling it.

250
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,234
But then as the rational mind it says, “So what?”

251
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:13,367
“Now we are feeling the cool breeze – so what?”

252
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:19,334
Then one should know that when we have eyes we start seeing,

253
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,300
when we have ears we start hearing,

254
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:27,734
so now we have got new awareness, what is this awareness?

255
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,434
This is the awareness of collective consciousness, that you become.

256
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,367
Again I say, “You become!” You are not just certified

257
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,534
but you become. It’s a question of becoming,

258
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,167
that you become collectively conscious,

259
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,801
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

260
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:53,610
you can feel your Self, you can feel your centres which are shown here,

261
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:57,378
you can feel the centres of others on your fingertips.

262
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,300
And the best on this, is Mohammed Sahib, I would say,

263
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,167
because he has written clearly,

264
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:06,367
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

265
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,167
But who talks about the resurrection?

266
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,400
In nowhere people talk about it.

267
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:15,300
They talk about the doomsday.

268
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,167
Because they can frighten people of the doomsday first,

269
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,434
and take advantage of it and make money out of it.

270
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,224
God who has created this Universe, He feels love,

271
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:32,234
do you think he will destroy this great creation of His

272
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,367
without giving us the fruit,

273
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:41,133
without letting us know the fruit of his creation?

274
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:52,133
He is the wisest of wise, the Greatest Compassionate source of love,

275
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,371
how could he allow this Universe to be destroyed?

276
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:07,458
Especially this Earth, which is a special present from Him.

277
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,167
So don’t believe in all these stupid ideas of destruction

278
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:20,400
and the Last Complete Devastation.

279
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,984
Still lot of time.

280
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:28,234
Let’s first enjoy the blessings of the Divine

281
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,234
for which He has created you.

282
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,267
So the experience of Truth has to be felt

283
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:37,234
on the central nervous system.

284
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:45,984
The problem is not that you will not feel – you will feel it –

285
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:53,967
but, as you know, the experience is very slow in the Western countries.

286
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:58,267
I am sorry [to say that]. Not that you are in any way less seekers.

287
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,200
You are very great seekers. I would say you are greater seekers

288
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,267
than the Indians are, much greater seekers.

289
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:09,167
Indians have still to cross lot of steps to come up to your level,

290
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:12,234
no doubt. But while coming up to this level,

291
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:15,167
you have gathered [a] lot of problems around you,

292
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:27,188
and that’s why the seeking sometimes takes time to express itself

293
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:31,397
as a fruitful gain of Self-realisation.

294
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:34,445
So you will get your realisation, no doubt,

295
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:37,133
but again the Kundalini goes down.

296
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:41,334
I must tell you very frankly, because I cannot be dishonest with you.

297
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:48,355
But it can be brought up by you, by understanding how to work it out.

298
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,267
By co-operating with yourself,

299
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:56,886
by understanding yourself that you are the temple of God

300
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:02,367
and that you have to work it out with respect to yourself.

301
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,568
And you have to give some time.

302
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:10,900
I mean, in Caxton Hall, you must have seen,

303
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,921
I had thousands of people coming to me.

304
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,133
I have been working in this England for twelve years now, twelve years.

305
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,367
It’s the last year now.

306
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,590
There’s a special reason for that.

307
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:30,751
But what I find [is that] people get their realisation and then get lost.

308
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,167
Then when they have some disease or something,

309
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,367
they’ll telephone to me, “Mother, now I am in the lunatic asylum!”

310
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,798
or, “I am suffering from cancer.”

311
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:42,406
“Now that’s happening to me. Can you help me?”

312
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,644
It’s too far gone a case [to help].

313
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,300
But if you know how to handle your roots, how to nourish it,

314
00:23:51,334 --> 00:24:01,682
how to look after it, then you flower out, you bear fruits,

315
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,267
and by your fruits people know what you are.

316
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:10,801
Then you become trees, giant trees, like Boddhi trees,

317
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:15,300
and many who come under such trees, get realisation.

318
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,015
English are a great people no doubt.

319
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,547
They are placed in a country which is the Heart of the Universe.

320
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:27,523
You are very important.

321
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:31,167
I have given the maximum time to England,

322
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:34,751
you’ll be amazed. Maximum time.

323
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,300
But the Sahaja Yogis who are not in England

324
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:47,013
have grown much faster than in England.

325
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:54,267
The reason is, it’s like the foundation that always gets damp here.

326
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,426
You have to again puncture something inside the foundation,

327
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:06,403
remove the dampness. Again it gets damp.

328
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:12,512
Rather difficult! But once they are settled

329
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:22,200
you will be circulating the Divine interpretation,

330
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,764
the Divine experience of Truth, all over the world.

331
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:30,234
You are at the heart point and this is what you have to do.

332
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:38,334
We cannot be mediocres in Sahaja Yoga.

333
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:42,656
There is no compromise with your Self.

334
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:46,660
You become so powerful that you don’t compromise also.

335
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,327
You can just get out of everything in no time.

336
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:54,605
But you must accept yourself first of all, have faith in yourself.

337
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:58,095
Once upon a time the English had too much faith in themselves,

338
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,835
I mean extraordinarily ‘powerful’ people.

339
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:04,882
Now they are the other way around – they have no faith.

340
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,267
You see now the sap has come up,

341
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:10,234
as if the dampness has come, “Oh, we are good for nothing!”

342
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:14,367
This is the second phase that I find in this country –

343
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,300
it’s complete lethargy. “Oh what can happen?

344
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:22,267
Let us be destroyed Mother! Now that’s the best for us!”

345
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,267
Completely reconciled to our doom.

346
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:34,679
And I look at them with great hope. They have to circulate.

347
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:40,551
They are the cells, who are lying in the heart,

348
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:46,300
who have to pump the heart. Now what am I to do?

349
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:50,133
So I have to make a humble request with you:

350
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:54,425
that I know the experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow

351
00:26:54,536 --> 00:27:01,300
but very steady and I am sure that today

352
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,451
I have got people who are of [a] rare quality of courage.

353
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:11,267
An assiduity, which was the English character, once upon a time.

354
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:15,350
And that they will take it up seriously:

355
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,445
their ascent and the ascent of the whole world.

356
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,246
We’ll be having about three more lectures

357
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,342
and there I will be telling you more elaborately

358
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:30,580
about Kundalini and the chakras and about all this knowledge.

359
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:34,881
All this knowledge is available to you now,

360
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:39,794
because it’s time was for you to know all the secrets.

361
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,481
Some newspaper people asked me,

362
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:48,167
“Mother have you got your disciples all very great scholars?”

363
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,434
I said, “No, they are all very ordinary people.

364
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:54,400
Some may be – who are more difficult –

365
00:27:56,133 --> 00:28:01,670
but mostly they are very normal, ordinary people.

366
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:07,367
Simple people. But what makes you think that way?”

367
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,255
They said, “They are so scholarly they know so much!”

368
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:13,367
Because you become The Knowledge.

369
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,200
So Truth is the knowledge.

370
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:22,250
The rest of it is all mythical, is mythical.

371
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:26,781
What do we know about things is all mythical,

372
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:31,741
because whatever we see from outside, is outside.

373
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:37,664
Like, I would say, we appreciate Mona Lisa,

374
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:43,680
we appreciate the miracles as we say,

375
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:48,727
the great miracles that human beings have created. Why?

376
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,504
Why do we call them miracles?

377
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:56,267
Sometimes we think that, maybe because it’s a very miraculous task,

378
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:01,100
they have done – mentally we think – but actually it is not so.

379
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:08,234
Because they have vibrations, they have Divine vibrations,

380
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:12,100
they emit vibrations and they appeal to you

381
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,848
because in your heart lies that Spirit which is the Universal Being

382
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,234
and which gives that feeling of bewilderment

383
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:30,663
when you see these great miracles that human beings have created.

384
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,585
At least I have seen six of them,

385
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,767
and all of them have tremendous vibrations.

386
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,877
But unless and until you become a realised-soul, how will you know?

387
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,567
Now this is the only gap.

388
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:53,297
And to become the realised-soul you have to have

389
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:59,481
the ascent of the Kundalini and the proper state

390
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:02,639
of that Kundalini to remain there.

391
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:08,947
And that’s the point where I found we lack in efforts,

392
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:16,524
lack in courage, in patience.

393
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,400
So again and again I request you that – don’t be superficial.

394
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,434
Let Americans be superficial. You’d better not be.

395
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,409
You be solid people, serious. Take it up seriously!

396
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:39,167
Because you are going to lead the Europeans, the Americans,

397
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:42,898
even the Greeks, even the Italians.

398
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,900
The problem is the horse is behind the cart!

399
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:52,944
Sitting lethargically. Now what am I to do to the horse?

400
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,167
That, “You get up now! Because of you the cart is not moving.”

401
00:30:57,786 --> 00:31:01,857
That’s why I make a very, very special request to you all,

402
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:06,300
that you must decide that – if we get our Realisation,

403
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:09,167
we’ll establish ourselves into Sahaja Yoga.

404
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,267
For which you don’t have to pay, there’s no membership,

405
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,200
there’s no organisation. Nothing.

406
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:28,859
I have nothing to take from you. You can’t give me anything.

407
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:38,267
So I hope today, many who are new will get their Realisation

408
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:42,259
and establish themselves and will not forget it.

409
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:45,267
Because in the beginning the experience is very great,

410
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,267
you feel as if you are coming out of a pub!

411
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:54,400
I don’t know what that experience is! Must be terrific! (laughter)

412
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:59,267
Because I see so many people coming and falling down

413
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:03,314
and again so many going in. So I used to wonder, “How is it?”

414
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,513
Must be some memory of something great, must be there!

415
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:19,344
So by God’s grace you should all get your Realisation

416
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:23,167
and I would like to have some questions,

417
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,676
but in that I would like to say that there are people I know,

418
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:31,267
we've had before also, belonged to some gurus or something,

419
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,315
paid by some gurus have come.

420
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:38,498
Because the gurus are feeling that I am, in a way, attacking them.

421
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,768
In a way, they feel that way because I say you cannot pay –

422
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:46,167
so all their profession is finished! (laughter)

423
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,593
So they get angry with me for that.

424
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,904
So they might  be saying, “Ah, you go and attack Her.”

425
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,135
And all sorts of things.

426
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:00,373
And there could be some people who are aggressive because of

427
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,464
other problems of ego or something.

428
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,300
So you need not be aggressive.

429
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,450
I have come here to give you what you have.

430
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:15,267
And you need not be also docile about it or slavish.

431
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:23,167
I have come here to give you or tell you, what is freedom.

432
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:28,916
Now you may also say, which is a very common question arising in your mind –

433
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,876
and justifiable – that why should I do it.

434
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Now that’s the miserable part of it, that I have to do it.

435
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:41,169
I wish you could do it – but you can’t – that’s the trouble.

436
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:45,811
And if I have to do it, I don’t hurt your ego.

437
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:49,338
No, I don’t want to hurt you.

438
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:54,409
You see this is something people don’t understand

439
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:57,200
that why should I do it?

440
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:04,292
You can do it also but first I’ll have to take you a little bit ahead,

441
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,609
your awareness has to grow a little more.

442
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,791
And then you can do it on your own.

443
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:14,275
But first definitely, I have to do that.

444
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:16,133
Which is a headache [for me]. I tell you,

445
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,167
it makes me also a miserable person

446
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,577
because, you know, this is something a thankless job of a Mother.

447
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:24,285
But I have to do it.

448
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:28,400
Maybe I am paid for it somehow! I don’t know.

449
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,667
Whichever way it is. But you shouldn’t feel hurt about it!

450
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:41,456
It’s a crucifixion, I tell you. It’s not easy.

451
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:45,133
It’s a very difficult task. It’s like [lifting] mountains sometimes.

452
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:49,914
The Kundalini is just embedded, poor thing, sometimes so hurt,

453
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:54,167
so wounded that to raise that wounded Kundalini, itself,

454
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,930
takes such a lot of effort.

455
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:05,065
But one has to do it and I knew I have to do it.

456
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:12,695
When you will know what it is you will not be angry with me,

457
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:17,536
but you will understand the task ahead of us, all of us.

458
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:19,852
All of us have to do it.

459
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,267
May God bless you all.

460
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:34,524
Now, as this is the first programme, I would like to have questions.

461
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:39,906
But sensible questions which will help everyone to ascend.

462
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,500
It should not be ‘dog in the manger’ policy –

463
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,601
that you don’t want to ascend? Alright, goodbye!

464
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,234
We cannot force. Actually we cannot force you.

465
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:54,100
It has to be asked for otherwise I cannot do it.

466
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:59,234
You have to knock at the door otherwise [the] door cannot be opened.

467
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,601
So those who do not want it should not bother to ask me questions.

468
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,534
I have seen mostly the people who ask me the questions

469
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,367
are the first to go away.

470
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:11,077
So, this is not meant for such people.

471
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:17,704
I mean, for that you can join, say miner’s strike or something like that.

472
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,214
(Laughter) (There was a big coal miner’s strike in UK in 1984).

473
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:24,200
But this is not the place for such people who want to fight it out.

474
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,500
It is something that’s so beautiful,

475
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:31,200
that is your own, which has to be opened out.

476
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:36,367
So you can ask me questions will be a good idea.

477
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:40,133
Thank you very much.

478
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:45,267
(nobody asks any questions)

479
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:57,434
That doesn’t mean you should not ask me questions (laughter).

480
00:36:57,434 --> 00:37:01,300
You shouldn’t be frightened. You should ask, you must.

481
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:18,367
No questions at all ? Now, I’ll ask one question.

482
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:22,300
How many are new people to Sahaja Yoga? Absolutely new.

483
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:24,595
Please raise your hands, please.

484
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,806
Can I request you to come in the front two rows, all of you, please.

485
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:33,710
If you don’t mind. [It] will be a better idea.

486
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:36,813
Because I want to look after you. Please.

487
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,100
Front two rows you can occupy. Front rows you can occupy.

488
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:02,400
Please.

489
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:33,889
Now it is a very collective working, extremely collective.

490
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,322
See, like this finger has some pain so the other hand comes round

491
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:42,200
and presses it and puts it right. Alright ?

492
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,100
So we are all part and parcel of One Being.

493
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:57,567
As you call them, the microcosm and the macrocosm.

494
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:02,567
And only thing [is] the ones which are awakened

495
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,133
will help to awaken the rest of it.

496
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:08,979
That doesn’t mean anybody is superior or higher or lower.

497
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,500
There is no obligation.

498
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,133
Like my own finger paining if I try to rub it,

499
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:22,267
am I obliging that finger? No, I am not. Because I can’t live without that.

500
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:27,351
I can’t bear the pain. And this is me, and this is me too.

501
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:29,351
In the same way it works out.

502
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:34,267
So we’ll try to work it out and, when it works out,

503
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:39,575
some of the Sahaja Yogis will come and see what the situation is,

504
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:44,334
what are the centres in trouble. Nobody should feel bad about it.

505
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,621
With all respect to you it will be done.

506
00:39:48,812 --> 00:39:53,367
So one should not feel bad or sad about it [or] in anyway hurt.

507
00:39:53,467 --> 00:40:02,367
Why I am saying so [is] because, you see sometimes people feel

508
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:08,159
that they are challenged. They feel that way. You should not.

509
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,053
It’s for your good, for your health.

510
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,434
So, I am just trying to tell you as a mother would say that,

511
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:19,634
“It’s alright, you see, and there’s nothing wrong with you.”

512
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,424
So, don’t be frightened of anyone.

513
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,200
Don’t be angry with anyone.

514
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:26,676
Specially with yourself don’t be angry and it will all work out.

515
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:29,601
Now, another thing I have to request is to take out your shoes

516
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:33,234
for one reason that this Mother Earth helps us a lot

517
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:35,534
and if you take out your shoes the Mother Earth,

518
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:40,634
you see, for earthing’s sake, it is better to take out.

519
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:47,926
Everything is so much artificial that it’s impossible

520
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,758
to reach the Mother Earth somehow.

521
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,846
Alright. Put both the feet straight like this.

522
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,267
It helps that’s why. Just to help.

523
00:40:56,434 --> 00:41:00,467
And sit in such a way that your back is straight.

524
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,601
Not too much of like this, forward, or bent.

525
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,400
But in a straight way, in a simple manner.

526
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:12,833
‘Sahaj’ also means ‘a simple way, spontaneous.’

527
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,055
As you sit, spontaneously.

528
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:21,167


529
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,167
