4
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,060
Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 04 July 1993.

5
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:08,293
Today we are going to have Guru Puja.

6
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:14,139
I’m supposed to be your guru,

7
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:24,650
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,180
is very different from Mine.

9
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:37,382
Normally, a guru is a very, very strict person

10
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:41,655
and has no patience of any kind.

11
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:51,284
Even, say music, there are gurus who teach music in India,

12
00:00:53,681 --> 00:01:01,866
so all the disciplines have to be absolutely followed.

13
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,447
I know about this great musician, Ravi Shankar.

14
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:13,633
We had been to Maihar where he came

15
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,868
and my father was very much respected by his guru, Allahudin Khan.

16
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,327
So he asked him, “Why don’t you play something.”

17
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,506
So he didn’t tell him anything that time.

18
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:31,333
Then he showed a big bump here. He said, “Sir, do you see this?”

19
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:35,233
He said, “What?” “My own tanpura,

20
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:43,512
he broke on my head because I was little bit out of tune.”

21
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:47,696
Otherwise, he was a very nice man, I must say.

22
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:53,088
I knew Allahudin Khan sahab, but when it came to teaching,

23
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:58,982
it’s a tradition I think

24
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:07,807
that you have to put all kinds of disciplines on the students,

25
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,546
but still the students stick on to the guru.

26
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:17,947
They look after all the time. They’re bothered with the guru.

27
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:22,609
He wants this thing, they’ll run. If he wants this, they’ll do.

28
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:31,948
A guru goes on taking different types of tests of the disciple.

29
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:35,799
Like Shivaji’s guru asked him that

30
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:41,583
“I would like drink the milk of a tigress.”

31
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,038
So he said, “All right.”

32
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:48,755
If my guru has said it, it is his lookout.

33
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:55,264
So went to the forest and he saw a tigress sitting there.

34
00:02:55,757 --> 00:03:00,086
She had already finished giving milk to her cubs,

35
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:04,488
so he bowed before the tigress and he said,

36
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,872
“See, my guru wants your milk.

37
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:11,504
Will you please give some milk for my guru?”

38
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,634
And the tigress understood it.

39
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:19,750
She stood up and he took out the milk of the tigress for the guru.

40
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:25,291
So, in this, one can see in the obedience of the guru,

41
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:30,643
one achieves even the impossible things.

42
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:39,818
Another time his guru said that he has got a big boil on his leg

43
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:46,183
and that it is all right and anybody who will suck it,

44
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,649
so has to be my disciple

45
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,207
and my disciple, when he sucks it, I will be all right.

46
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:59,260
Everybody was so averse to a thing like that.

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,391
Shivaji maharaj said, “Of course I will suck it.”

48
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,181
He bend down. And he started sucking it

49
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:12,520
from the bandage that was there and it was a mango.

50
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:22,236
So there are two, three types of tests are all the time taken

51
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:31,380
of the disciple. Firstly, how much they obey you.

52
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:43,981
But, as you all have got Realization and you are your own gurus,

53
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:50,252
I don’t put that condition on you.

54
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:58,557
I leave it to your freedom. I tell you earnestly,

55
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:05,767
in all the way possible, what I think good for you,

56
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:17,128
but I don’t compel like these gurus used to do.

57
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:24,437
I mean, they used to beat. They used to hang them on the well.

58
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:30,188
They were so very strict

59
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:34,616
with their disciples and I’ve had an experience of this.

60
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:40,980
They never used to smile. No question of laughing.

61
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:49,463
And would never show any kind of weakness

62
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,827
of kindness for the disciples.

63
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:57,427
This is about the spiritual gurus I am telling you,

64
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:04,186
but those who wanted their ascent, wanted their Realization

65
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:10,306
would go on passing through all kinds of tortures

66
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,790
that they put on them.

67
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,551
Some of the gurus who didn’t like some disciples,

68
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,002
they would tell them, “All right,

69
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:23,529
you now stand on your one leg all the time.”

70
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:28,936
So they’re standing on one leg like a crane.

71
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:37,293
Another one, they would say that “you stand on your head.”

72
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:50,115
The way they used to treat their disciples

73
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:58,021
was rather difficult for Me. I can’t do it.

74
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:09,343
All the time the compassion becomes the tears in My eyes.

75
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:16,412
I find it impossible. I may just say it in a way,

76
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:24,885
sometimes also, say it in a way that looks like little scolding,

77
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:30,439
but to be a Mother and to be a guru is the most difficult thing.

78
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:42,751
I do not know what comes first, but, of course, every mother wants

79
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:49,274
her child to be good and the Holy Mother wants

80
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,366
Her child to be a holy person.

81
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:57,715
The first thing is the holiness.

82
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:04,092
Now for that, how can you compel someone?

83
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:16,572
Only thing that makes you understand is this

84
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:26,910
that if you don’t become holy, how will you get your ascent?

85
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,116
We have to be holy.

86
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:38,964
What discipline one can put for making a person holy?

87
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:46,567
What can you force? What can you get angry for?

88
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,274
Only method I use normally is to forgive.

89
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:03,338
Maybe the forgiveness is the highest quality, I think,

90
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,314
for teaching people.

91
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:12,866
When they know that they have done wrong and they confess it,

92
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,584
then you have to forgive.

93
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:22,183
Like in the life of Buddha, there was a man

94
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:32,707
who was abusing him

95
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,692
without understanding

96
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:44,800
and when he finished with his abuses and Buddha had left,

97
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,044
people told him, “Do you know whom you were abusing?”

98
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:53,206
It was Lord Buddha. Got a fright of his life.

99
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:58,293
He said, “Where is he gone?” “He has gone to another village.”

100
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,735
So he went to another village and he said, “Sir,

101
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:06,057
I am sorry for what I said. Please forgive me. It’s all wrong

102
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,846
and I should not have done it. You can punish me the way you like.”

103
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,573
Lord Buddha said, “When did you do that?”

104
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:23,473
He said, “Yesterday.” He said, “I don’t know yesterday.

105
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:25,490
I know only today.”

106
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:31,553
You see, even you tell these things,

107
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:34,101
how great one feels, isn’t it?

108
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:39,323
So your greatness, your nobility

109
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:45,180
will definitely influence people.

110
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,854
It’s not by fighting, by quarrelling,

111
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:55,419
by saying harsh things it is going to work out.

112
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:04,219
Also the gurus used to control the children very much,

113
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:09,398
the disciples very much, absolutely control.

114
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,280
You have to get up at four o’clock, sit down for meditation.

115
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:17,839
If you have not got up, they would beat.

116
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,314
I can’t understand. Sahaja

117
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,251
Yoga is very different

118
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:40,335
from all other gurus that we believe in the power of love.

119
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:50,934
Power of love teaches you how to be forgiving.

120
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,878
It makes you noble.

121
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:04,036
It makes you very balanced.

122
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,276
So the gurus who were there for bhavasagara

123
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,177
to establish dharma in the human beings,

124
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,514
first thing, they had to balance themselves

125
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:35,913
against all practical things, as they call it.

126
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:39,897
They think it is not practical,

127
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:51,627
but they said, “No, for us, this is higher, nobler and important.”

128
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,238
So they would balance people

129
00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:01,453
because they had this power of love within themselves.

130
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:06,890
All these Adi Gurus and their incarnations, if you see them,

131
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:15,830
they always had balance and always praised the love of God.

132
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:32,267
When we talk about Realization, one has to know, first of all,

133
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:36,155
that we have to have patience with ourselves.

134
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,750
I know some people don’t feel so good,

135
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:46,888
some people still have sicknesses.

136
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,460
Some people don’t even feel vibrations sometimes.

137
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:56,358
Have patience with yourself.

138
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,186
When you become your own guru, first thing,

139
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:05,436
as the guru has patience with his or her disciple,

140
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,784
you must have patience with yourself.

141
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:22,121
In that patience, you will learn that you can tolerate

142
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,797
so many things without any trouble.

143
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,919
They say one person who goes on grudging,

144
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,229
“Oh, this is not good. That is not good”

145
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:44,577
because they have no patience with themselves.

146
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,041
If you have patience with yourself, everything you’ll accept.

147
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,128
Wherever you are, you are with yourself

148
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,592
because you’re realized souls.

149
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:05,518
So you won’t frustrate, you’ll not get angry

150
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:14,721
and also you’ll not go on grumbling and grudging

151
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:18,225
because you’re enjoying yourself.

152
00:15:19,646 --> 00:15:23,679
Even if there’s a mattress, all right.

153
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,016
If there isn’t, you can sleep on the grass.

154
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,724
If there’s no grass, you can sleep on the stone.

155
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:32,470
And also you need not sleep like last night,

156
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:37,578
makes no difference whatsoever.

157
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,234
The first thing I find with people,

158
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,686
they have no patience with themselves.

159
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:51,803
Firstly, maybe, because they’re conditioned.

160
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,632
Say, if you have a left Vishuddhi,

161
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:59,184
by any chance you have been a Catholic or T.M. or something,

162
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,510
then all the time you start pitying yourself,

163
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,550
thinking no end of your miseries and troubles

164
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,004
and always try to condemn yourself.

165
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,287
You are a realized soul

166
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:17,275
and you have no business to condemn yourself, no business.

167
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,651
Like a person who’s getting drowned, has been saved,

168
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,577
has come to the shore, now is doing nicely,

169
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,049
has got his second life

170
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:41,196
and there he’s still trying to express his agony,

171
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:44,031
as if he’s getting drowned.

172
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:50,301
So you have to awaken yourself. “No, no, no more I am there.

173
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:55,869
I’m finished. It’s gone now. I am different.

174
00:16:56,488 --> 00:17:01,276
That was somebody else. I am not the same person.”

175
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:06,977
This is how you have to tell yourself very clearly

176
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:10,451
that “I am not going to condemn myself.”

177
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:19,859
It was your right to get Self Realization. You got it.

178
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:27,263
And then you cannot enjoy it because you have these conditionings,

179
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:32,300
especially in the West to be miserable, it is very fashionable.

180
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:39,648
There are miseries of people who have no miseries.

181
00:17:52,215 --> 00:18:01,057
So, for such people who have imaginary miseries of the past,

182
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,641
which do not exist in reality,

183
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,099
they cannot have the joy of reality. They cannot.

184
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:18,593
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it’s important that he should have joy

185
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,952
within his heart. It’s like an ocean.

186
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:40,657
It’s like an ocean which is there all the time

187
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:50,200
to give you such thrills.

188
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:59,568
Even little drops of this ocean,

189
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:07,400
when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing.

190
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:12,729
The experience can be only experienced.

191
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:20,043
It’s all waiting within yourself.

192
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:32,898
And such a person also makes others joyous.

193
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,844
He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble.

194
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:49,308
Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.

195
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:53,874
You can get joy from small, small things

196
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,216
because you have the ocean

197
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,477
and a little thing that drops into the ocean

198
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:05,188
creates such beautiful ripples. They touch the shores,

199
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:11,202
not only of your own being, but of others.

200
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:19,175
Very, very small things make you so very happy

201
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,950
and that all the time

202
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,843
you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days,

203
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:32,142
on this beautiful lake or a beautiful ocean of love.

204
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:39,460
Love is joy-giving. It’s not carnal love.

205
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,014
It is Divine Love.

206
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:51,147
So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves

207
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,165
and understand our own value.

208
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:59,823
I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value.

209
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:04,175
How many people in this world can give Realization?

210
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:11,473
How many know about kundalini?

211
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:20,061
How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?

212
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:29,655
You are made so powerful

213
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,767
that even looking at people, you can give Realization.

214
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:50,486
In ordinary love, in carnal love people have fear.

215
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:58,394
They’re afraid that their beloved might depart

216
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:02,076
or might get sick, might happen this

217
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:13,323
and they might all the time be under fear, resist enjoying.

218
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:24,398
But, for you, you are with yourself and you are always protected.

219
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:38,038
If your attention is bad for a second even,

220
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:41,585
immediately you know you are going wrong.

221
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:44,828
You protect yourself from yourself.

222
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,153
As soon as you get some physical problem, you can feel it.

223
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:57,006
You know how to cure yourself.

224
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:02,092
But again, one has to have balance.

225
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:06,072
If you’re off the balance,

226
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:09,742
then you don’t even feel vibrations,

227
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:14,040
you don’t even feel what’s wrong with you.

228
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,591
You don’t know which direction you are moving,

229
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,604
whether you are getting destroyed.

230
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,442
And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.

231
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:45,531
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past

232
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,996
or maybe about our future.

233
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,064
We worry about these things.

234
00:23:54,492 --> 00:23:59,011
What is there to worry when all the angels and all the ganas

235
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,102
are working for you?

236
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:05,945
You just have to order, that’s all.

237
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,799
But it’s like sometimes a person is made a king

238
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:19,587
and is put on a throne, but before that he was a beggar,

239
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:23,161
so anybody who comes to bow before him, he says,

240
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,428
“All right. Give me one pound.”

241
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:34,576
You have to know that you are all realized souls

242
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:38,699
and that you have all the powers within you.

243
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:44,307
Only thing which is very important is the balance.

244
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:50,863
In Sahaja Yoga also people get into imbalances.

245
00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:03,794
How? Like I have seen people

246
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:10,913
who are, say, afraid of these worldly laws.

247
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:24,396
They don’t know there is such a powerful energy all around you.

248
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:34,988
Nothing can stop you. Nothing can arrest you.

249
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:37,568
Nothing can find faults.

250
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:42,353
But when you start doubting, like yesterday’s doubting,

251
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,517
when you say, “But, but.”

252
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:52,799
When you start thinking about the man-made laws,

253
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,574
then the God’s laws fail.

254
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,511
Otherwise, nobody can punish you, nobody can arrest you,

255
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:08,984
nobody can do anything to you. You are absolutely protected.

256
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:22,012
So the main difference between the old style of guru

257
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:26,058
and the modern style of guru is this

258
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:31,801
that the old gurus used to you must suffer. All right,

259
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:34,023
you have to be arrested is very good.

260
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:37,219
If they give you poison, take the poison.

261
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:40,318
If they want to slap you, take slaps.

262
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,944
Whatever they want to do, you should accept

263
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,422
because is your suffering.

264
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:49,601
Not in Sahaja Yoga because your Mother is sitting here.

265
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,736
How dare anybody touch you.

266
00:26:57,893 --> 00:27:02,773
No one can harm you. You have to believe Me when I say that.

267
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:08,698
No one can harm you, but you must have that faith within yourself.

268
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:14,875
Nobody had Adi Shakti as the Guru.

269
00:27:17,645 --> 00:27:21,617
Adi Shakti, the one who has all the powers of the world.

270
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:27,535
So who can harm you? Who can torture you?

271
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,083
Who can trouble you except for yourself?

272
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:34,204
If you want to torture yourself, nobody can harm you.

273
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:41,939
So the greatest difference between this disciple of other gurus

274
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:46,158
and yourself is you don’t have to suffer.

275
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:55,994
You are not to suffer and even, you see,

276
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:59,316
if there’s somebody who has some negativity, that person,

277
00:27:59,517 --> 00:28:02,881
some Sahaja Yogis still carry on poor things they cannot help it

278
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,074
they have been to wrong gurus or something.

279
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,828
So they’ll meet with an accident,

280
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:15,943
maybe they might face something terrible,

281
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:20,221
but suddenly they’ll find they will get out of it.

282
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,510
Maybe the negativity of somebody else,

283
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,665
some relations, some brothers, sisters or maybe of the nation.

284
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,177
But you’ll get out of it.

285
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,338
It is a very remarkable thing in Sahaja Yoga

286
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:46,558
that there are people who catching.

287
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:51,610
“Mother, my heart is catching. My this is catching. That is catching.”

288
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,512
But once they want to give Realization, just moves, kundalini moves.

289
00:28:57,496 --> 00:29:02,297
Whatever you may be, whatever may be your problems,

290
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:05,848
but you raise your hand and kundalini moves.

291
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,668
I mean, any instrument which is spoiled,

292
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:11,470
say, supposing this fan is spoiled, it won’t work.

293
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,790
But not Sahaja Yogis.

294
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:22,951
They work out, of course,

295
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:27,541
if they don’t practice Sahaja Yoga

296
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:30,818
or if they don’t give Realizations to others,

297
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:35,172
then, of course, it can be a junk then.

298
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,670
Supposing you don’t use your car, may be very good

299
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,013
and you don’t use it, it becomes a junk.

300
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:49,243
So you have to give. You have to give Realization.

301
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:52,522
All of you, whether it’s women or men.

302
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,338
Whatever country you may belong, you have to give Realization,

303
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:05,890
you have to allow this energy to go and work,

304
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:12,884
otherwise it will suffocate.

305
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:18,526
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis who have not done anything like that.

306
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:22,347
They are very nice to you. Mother, we worship you at home.

307
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:25,896
They suffer also from arthritis

308
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:32,692
or other kinds of things,

309
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:37,798
spondylitis’ sometimes they will have or

310
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:42,370
they may have cellulitis or all kinds of things they can have.

311
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:50,861
So you have to use your energy for giving Realizations to others.

312
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:58,181
It’s all right, in protocol, if you don’t understand,

313
00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:00,086
you are forgiven.

314
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:06,006
Anything you might do out of innocence or ignorance is forgiven.

315
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:11,505
But knowingly, if you want to do something,

316
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,311
then I don’t know repercussions

317
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:24,694
because the area where you are is safe,

318
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:29,419
but if you want to get out of that area,

319
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:37,745
then all sides there are horrible negative forces working

320
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:40,821
and you are captured into that.

321
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:46,881
That’s not a mistake of Sahaja Yoga.

322
00:31:49,722 --> 00:31:55,430
To find faults with Sahaja Yogis or with Sahaja Yoga

323
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:59,365
is another mistake we commit sometime.

324
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:08,047
Say there are ten disciples with a guru, very good excellent guru,

325
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,921
if they complain about any one of them,

326
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:21,991
immediately the guru will say, “You get out.”

327
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:33,312
They have no business to complain about each other.

328
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:38,502
On the contrary, like this hand is paining,

329
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,324
then this hand doesn’t complain to the brain,

330
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,657
but tries to soothe it.

331
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:57,922
So Sahaja Yogis are gurus who belong to the collective.

332
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:03,980
They move in a group, as described by Gnyaneshwara,

333
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,176
that you move now like the enlightened forest,

334
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:18,917
which gives whatever people like, want to have, kalpatarus.

335
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:30,727
And he said you move like oceans and talk about God.

336
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:34,210
It’s not one single man standing and saying something.

337
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:38,920
We saw yesterday in drama how a single man had to suffer.

338
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,602
But you are in a group

339
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:50,900
and all of you move in a group, together,

340
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:55,519
with one understanding.

341
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,666
Such a powerful group it is.

342
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:08,669
They bring ambrosia to the people, according to Gnyaneshwara.

343
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:17,254
But this power of collectivity that one feels

344
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:20,964
is the first judgement of a person.

345
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:30,878
Those who cannot be collective are not yet Sahaja Yogis.

346
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,264
Some people think that they have served Me,

347
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:44,281
they have looked after Me, they do My Puja or something,

348
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:50,497
so that they have a right to scold others, to get angry with others,

349
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:54,709
shout at them, tell them work, do all kinds of thing.

350
00:34:57,122 --> 00:34:58,799
It’s not so.

351
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:04,305
You are a Sahaja Yogi when you are absolutely collective.

352
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:09,454
Otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi when you are not collective.

353
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:16,408
It’s so simple.

354
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:22,386
That ego, the conditionings of ego

355
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:30,932
or conditionings of the past may keep you away from others

356
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,193
and there is no connection to the Divine any more left.

357
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,426
Those who are not collective people

358
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:40,547
have no relationship with the Divine.

359
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:50,504
You have understood now what is collectivity is.

360
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:56,597
Most surprising thing is for Me that by giving Realizations to you,

361
00:35:56,797 --> 00:36:03,909
I find it very easy to talk about subtlest of subtle things to you.

362
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:10,566
All these things I don’t think any guru could have talked.

363
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:15,705
Not possible. It would not go into their heads.

364
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,195
Very subtle, it is. You have become subtle

365
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:27,888
and the subtleties have their own beauty in expression,

366
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:32,581
in expression, in talking,

367
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:37,417
in behaving with others, in understanding.

368
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:40,899
It’s so sweet and so beautiful.

369
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:53,434
The collective feeling is something like

370
00:36:53,634 --> 00:37:01,721
a little particle of clay thinks it is a mountain,

371
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:07,181
like a drop becoming the ocean.

372
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,551
But if there’s one drop who says, “No, no, no. I can’t be collective.

373
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,114
I stay on the shore.” All right,

374
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:17,847
the sunshine will evaporate.

375
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:25,656
“But, Mother, I worship you. I do this. I do that.”

376
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:29,099
With all that, if you do not develop collectivity,

377
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:31,196
better not worship Me.

378
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:40,739
For that, how a guru should act with the collective?

379
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:47,956
In Sahaja Yoga nobody should feel

380
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:53,353
that you are some hierarchy or a higher personality.

381
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:57,467
If you start feeling like that, then at that point,

382
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:01,126
you must know that there is some possession on you.

383
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:09,805
What is the highest in the water? Nothing.

384
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:13,332
Everything is just the same. It’s the way it is there.

385
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:18,703
It has to be used for its own purposes.

386
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:29,167
And the cruelties sometimes people indulge into is unimaginable.

387
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:41,246
How can this kind of satisfaction

388
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:47,025
be there if you are Sahaja Yogis?

389
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:51,526
I don’t know. They say so, that gurus used to beat

390
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:57,151
and they used to do all kinds of things. There must be bhoots. No.

391
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:04,046
A very angry gurus. You cannot afford to be angry.

392
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:08,931
Cannot afford. Anger means imbalance.

393
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:14,004
You get attached to, say, your family,

394
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,438
start talking like that and no more.

395
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:27,770
Attachment to anything shows you have no balance.

396
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:35,915
Those who are balanced have to be detached.

397
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:42,579
Otherwise you get attached to somebody.

398
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:47,627
This is my daughter. This is my son. This is this.

399
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:50,881
Then you don’t see the truth.

400
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:55,888
So any kind of attachment,

401
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:04,598
if you feel then know that you are not in balance.

402
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:12,882
Also I’ve seen people get into a kind of a pride,

403
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:22,010
pride that we are Sahaja Yogis.

404
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:29,123
We have become Sahaja Yogis to save the whole world.

405
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:32,420
It’s like I see so many government servants who think

406
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,922
no end of themselves. They’re servants of the people.

407
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:44,240
They may be called officers, but officers to serve.

408
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:49,388
In the same way, we are in this world to serve God

409
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:53,807
and the purpose of your service is to save the world,

410
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:56,791
save the people.

411
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,546
But if you have pride, false pride, how can you do that?

412
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:12,141
The way you’ll talk, the way you’ll behave, nobody will come near.

413
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:23,787
You cannot be jealous of another person, cannot be

414
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:39,309
because jealousy means

415
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,836
that you are trying to harm yourself really.

416
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:49,088
I don’t know what jealousy is so much.

417
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:52,145
I see people getting jealous,

418
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:56,633
but I don’t know what it is really, jealousy.

419
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:59,504
The funny stuff, isn’t it?

420
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:08,998
It must be coming from animal kingdom maybe, I don’t know,

421
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:15,598
because what is there to be jealous. I mean, you are realized souls.

422
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,425
How can you be jealous of anyone?

423
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:34,353
Say, supposing you are a diamond and another one is a diamond.

424
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:39,703
Very good. Both put together will become even more brilliant.

425
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:47,737
Now, supposing somebody is no good and you are very good,

426
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,299
then there is nothing to feel jealous of the man who is no good.

427
00:42:54,499 --> 00:43:01,217
Or also somebody who is good, to feel jealous, what is your gain?

428
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,231
If you think that gentleman is good or that lady’s good,

429
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:10,463
better try to follow what she is doing, how is she good,

430
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:13,636
how she has got this goodness.

431
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,858
It’s better to study.

432
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:26,492
I really enjoy the most when Sahaja Yogis start

433
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:31,531
expressing their feelings about other Sahaja Yogis.

434
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:38,400
“Mother, he’s like that. Mother, he’s like that.”

435
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,707
So, they see the goodness of others.

436
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:48,084
They see the greatness of others, the nobility of others

437
00:43:48,284 --> 00:43:51,966
and when you start seeing that, you start becoming.

438
00:43:57,266 --> 00:44:02,083
If you feel jealous, I mean,

439
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:05,609
I don’t know what sort of a thing it is, as I told you.

440
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,379
But you are condemning yourself permanently.

441
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,185
Today you are jealous of somebody because he has black hair.

442
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:16,404
You are jealous of somebody because he has grey hair.

443
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:20,050
You’re jealous of somebody because he has got a long nose,

444
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,070
jealous of somebody because he has got a short nose.

445
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:28,344
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Sahaja Yogi:] What is happening?

446
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:31,689
What happened? Ha?

447
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:39,624
Are you a Sahaja Yogi?

448
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:43,906
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Then you know the protocol. Let Me speak.

449
00:44:44,106 --> 00:44:46,434
All right? You can ask Me later on.

450
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:50,501
This is not the way. This is not a parliament here.

451
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,706
I know. I know that I don’t force any discipline,

452
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:57,324
but this should be self discipline.

453
00:44:57,524 --> 00:45:00,449
You should be self-disciplined.

454
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:04,387
I’m speaking just now. Listen to Me.

455
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:08,797
Maybe I might answer you in My speech.

456
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:26,458
So the relationship among yourselves

457
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:33,117
cannot have anything to do with jealousy. Cannot.

458
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,941
Because it kills your joy.

459
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,711
Now, as I told you, that you get rid of your fear.

460
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:56,952
You get rid of your jealousies.

461
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:05,708
You get rid of your pride,

462
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:08,304
false one.

463
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:14,065
And also you get rid of your impatience.

464
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,992
You must have patience.

465
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:28,428
This is another style of guru

466
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:33,501
who has patience, tremendous patience.

467
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:40,055
Nothing to get angry, nothing to get upset.

468
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,193
And gradually, you will see,

469
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:47,167
without telling people, they will discipline themselves.

470
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:52,402
It is you have to discipline yourself.

471
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:59,911
In the system of Sahaja Yoga,

472
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:04,889
we never had so many disciples.

473
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:11,762
Imagine till Shri Gnyaneshwara, there was only one disciple

474
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:14,284
and some of them never had any disciple,

475
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:17,884
like William Blake, I don’t think had any disciple.

476
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:21,091
Perhaps, they must have thought

477
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:23,904
that nobody can come up to this level or understand.

478
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:28,163
So many of them had no disciple.

479
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:30,987
Sai Nath had no disciple.

480
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:34,251
They came on this Earth or maybe they might be thinking

481
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,348
useless people, what’s the use of having disciples?

482
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:48,199
But, for you, it’s so great that we are so many of us together now,

483
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:52,982
so many. We understand each other. We know each other.

484
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:01,524
We know all about kundalini

485
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:05,246
and  we are so aware about everything.

486
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:08,108
We know what’s happening in this world.

487
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:11,714
We are not just sitting in a cave in Himalayas

488
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:15,574
and just we are doing, taking the name of God. No.

489
00:48:15,774 --> 00:48:21,794
We are in the world. We are not running away from the world.

490
00:48:21,994 --> 00:48:24,489
We are in this world.

491
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:34,131
We are facing every day,

492
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:38,694
every problem that is there.

493
00:48:38,894 --> 00:48:44,741
But we are in reality and they are in ignorance.

494
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:51,610
That’s why we know, we know the solution,

495
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:58,213
we know the problem and we can solve it.

496
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:03,471
Now, you have to just experiment with your powers,

497
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:08,523
of course with humility that I have to warn some people.

498
00:49:08,723 --> 00:49:13,055
See, they just sit on the horse, immediately I say that.

499
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:17,734
First of all, you must know that you are a store of knowledge,

500
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,099
complete store of knowledge

501
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:29,237
about everything, except for bank, I would say.

502
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:33,839
That’s the problem for Me.

503
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:48,269
So you should have projection

504
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:54,567
towards that source of knowledge.

505
00:49:56,695 --> 00:50:02,400
For example, everything can be interpreted in the Sahaj language.

506
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:08,031
Everything. You see this pandal.

507
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,424
It’s standing there because supported by this

508
00:50:11,624 --> 00:50:17,543
– just like Sahaja Yoga. We are supported by our dharma.

509
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,235
Very simple thing like that.

510
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:21,965
Everywhere you’ll find

511
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:27,652
the comparison of Sahaja Yoga with everything else that you see.

512
00:50:30,954 --> 00:50:37,118
This is very important. That will give a double joy.

513
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:47,273
The other day I was coming back

514
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:57,077
and in the airport, it was I was perspiring,

515
00:50:57,278 --> 00:51:00,405
perspiring absolutely.

516
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:03,383
And the Sahaja Yogi who was with Me, he said, “Mother,

517
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:08,060
You are sucking all the heat of this place, the negativity.”

518
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,271
It was a fact. But only a Sahaja Yogi can see.

519
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:15,251
Everybody was sitting nicely. I was the one fanning Myself.

520
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:18,169
Everybody was so comfortable, feeling the cool from Me

521
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,902
and I was fanning Myself.

522
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:27,604
One day it happened, I was going to a shop,

523
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:29,820
all the Australian Sahaja Yogi following Me,

524
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,150
in a Chinese shop. I don’t know what these Chinese do.

525
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:38,066
Climbing up was feeling so hot and exhausted.

526
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:43,296
I was just trying to soothe Myself.

527
00:51:43,497 --> 00:51:46,280
And they’re saying, “Mother, such cool coming from you.”

528
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,595
I said, “Very nice.”

529
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:58,400
I’m the one consuming all the heat and giving you all the cool.

530
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:06,845
But that is what My job is,

531
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:10,514
to take all the heat from everyone

532
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:16,753
and transform it into something cooling and soothing.

533
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:22,959
When people shout, scream, this, that.

534
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,612
 Peaceful, be peaceful and listen to them

535
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:34,402
and then you can pour water on them completely

536
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:37,177
and the whole heat can go away.

537
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:40,815
So this absorption is very important.

538
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:43,621
Not to be afraid of absorption.

539
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:48,585
But, for that, I would say one should take care

540
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:51,831
and the care, as you know, is a very simple thing, this Kavacha,

541
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:58,071
is this bandhan that you have to take.

542
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:05,159
For all this, whatever I have said, there’s one guru mantra,

543
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:10,777
to remember that we are Sahaja Yogis.

544
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:17,735
Just remember this. We are Sahaja Yogis.

545
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:28,333
And once you know you are Sahaja Yogis, this projection will start.

546
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:33,087
What happened to William Blake? If you see,

547
00:53:33,287 --> 00:53:36,250
he started projecting his imagination

548
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,850
and he reached the point of knowledge.

549
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:48,491
So anything that you see, anything you do or others are doing,

550
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:53,187
try to relate it with Sahaja Yoga and project.

551
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:58,834
Then you will also reach the Ocean of Love.

552
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:02,480
Once you have that, then what?

553
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,294
Who can disturb you? Who can trouble you?

554
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:08,138
Who can make anything that is difficult for you?

555
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:11,313
Because you are sitting in the ocean, the fellow

556
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:13,019
is sitting outside somewhere,

557
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:16,286
how can it come into the ocean to trouble you?

558
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:23,365
So this is what is to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

559
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:29,861
Take a bandhan morning and evening. It’s so simple.

560
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:35,055
Even to say on the “my,” it seems stupid to Me.

561
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:38,592
But, I have to say because people forget.

562
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:41,240
You forget that you are realized souls.

563
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,277
Use your vibratory awareness for at least protecting yourself

564
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:54,516
because there is negativity sitting next to you.

565
00:54:54,716 --> 00:54:58,149
So be very careful about this, to remember that

566
00:54:58,349 --> 00:54:59,943
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

567
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,954
Once you say that, you will know how you have to behave,

568
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:04,589
what is the protocol,

569
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:07,601
you will know what is the discipline you have to follow,

570
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:11,741
you’ll know how to love others, everything.

571
00:55:14,463 --> 00:55:16,626
This is the essence.

572
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:22,781
How many have been Sahaja Yogis before?

573
00:55:23,062 --> 00:55:25,479
Poor things, all these gurus suffered so much.

574
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:27,686
You are not to suffer,

575
00:55:27,886 --> 00:55:34,060
not to go into any kind of a misery anymore, no more.

576
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:38,204
But don’t forget you are Sahaja Yogis, that’s why.

577
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:41,759
That will give you complete confidence in yourself and

578
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:45,237
you’ll be absolutely secured.

579
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:51,578
Try to establish the state that you are Sahaja Yogis.

580
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:57,964
Thus, you become gurus of yourself and of others.

581
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:00,667
May God bless you.
