1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:24,779
It is so Sahaja today that the day of celebration 
has fallen onto the birthday of Shri Ganesh.

2
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:37,890
Every month they celebrate the fourth day 
of the moon as the birth date of Shri Ganesh,

3
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,550
and today is that date.

4
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:47,670
Luckily, we are here for the Puja of Shri 
Ganesha on His birthday.

5
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:58,530
I’ve said a lot about Shri Ganesha and His 
importance in our life.

6
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:08,320
He’s the giver of wisdom, but this wisdom 
comes from our innocence.

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,040
Innocence that is innate within us.

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:28,780
As children we are innocent, but as we grow 
we start exerting ourselves in a manner that

9
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,430
we start losing our innocence.

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:41,380
We lose it in two ways; once we have lost 
our innocence, we cannot believe that others

11
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,990
could be innocent.

12
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:53,750
Another is, that we think innocence is not 
important.

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,160
Innocence is the sustenance, is the basis 
of spirituality.

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:07,070
If a person doesn’t have innocence, he cannot 
rise in spirituality.

15
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:15,200
That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga 
is to establish Shri Ganesha within you, to

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,319
awaken Him.

17
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,469
As soon as the Kundalini awakens, you must 
know that, Shri Ganesha comes into being.

18
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,719
Without His awakening within you, the Kundalini 
cannot be raised.

19
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:34,779
But it could be temporary, or it could be 
a permanent thing.

20
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:43,279
It could be very temporary with people who 
are not yet adjusted to the new method, or

21
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:50,239
to the ways of God’s love.

22
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,299
Those who have not understood, or those who 
have not gone through those traditions, is

23
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,980
rather difficult for them to establish Shri 
Ganesha within them.

24
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:11,290
At this point I find, there are people who 
fight with their problems, and try to overcome

25
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,959
the outward problems, and establish Shri Ganesha.

26
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,050
But there are other people who are still not 
there; they start doubting others’ innocence.

27
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,730
In Sahaja Yoga is a very common failing.

28
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,779
I’ve seen people complaining about others, 
saying that their innocence is not established.

29
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:38,029
Is the first sign that your own innocence 
is in danger.

30
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,220
Because you doubt yourself, you are doubting 
others.

31
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,709
If you are doubting others, then be sure that 
you are not going to gain anything.

32
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,459
Your job is to look after yourself, and not 
others.

33
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,709
And if you start doing like this, gradually 
in your mooladhara, there will be lots of

34
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,799
these bhoots, that will just jump in.

35
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,499
And they’ll give you more ideas, and more 
ideas of doubting others.

36
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:10,980
By doubting others, you can never correct 
them, and never yourself.

37
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,350
So those people who indulge into this kind 
of practices, go away from their innocence.

38
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:26,660
They try to find out what others are doing, 
what are their ways of using other people

39
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,690
in Sahaja Yoga, for their own purposes.

40
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,230
Or some sort of a funny spy-like attitude, 
they develop.

41
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,230
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to only spy yourself, 
and not others.

42
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,970
Those who start spying themselves, criticizing 
others, will never rise higher, than what

43
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,970
you are.

44
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,370
In the beginning, I have seen many Sahaja 
Yogis, who come, also try to do this, to criticize

45
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:02,510
others; this is the sign of their immaturity, 
sign of their, also, poor awakening of their

46
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,500
Shri Ganesha.

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,690
So those who come for the first time should 
be very careful that, still we have to achieve

48
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,700
a lot.

49
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,630
And we should not start doubting others, making 
remarks about others.

50
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:23,170
Because in innocence, people can be very, 
very simple, very friendly, but inside their

51
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,660
hearts there is no malice, there’s no filth.

52
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,140
But those who come for the first time sometimes 
have the filth within them.

53
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,660
And they see the reflection of their own filth, 
in other people.

54
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,080
I had gone to a program in Kolhapor – and 
you know how your Mother is innocent and pure-and

55
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,430
a gentleman came and he told Me that he has 
a nabhi problem.

56
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,100
So I said: ‘All right, you put your hand 
on My nabhi’ He put his hand there, and

57
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,810
the women there, who were really funny women, 
they said: ‘Why should Mother allow another

58
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,930
man to touch Her knee?’

59
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,990
They could not understand that: ‘How could 
anybody touch a lady’s knee?’

60
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,260
But once you are at that level, you don’t 
really know that there is bad in it.

61
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,850
And you just say: ‘All right, it’s all 
right, you can touch my knee.’

62
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,450
And the fellow got all right, with his trouble, 
with his nabhi.

63
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,690
So you see, the thing is, if your eyes are 
clean, you can understand, what is clean,

64
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,270
and what is unclean.

65
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,830
But if your eyes are not clean, you start 
seeing something that you want to see.

66
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,980
Or sometimes you see something that never 
exists.

67
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,810
So I would request all the new Sahaja Yogis 
who are here, not to criticize the old Sahaja

68
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,190
Yogis, and this is very anti-God activity.

69
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,600
Never say a word about the old Sahaja Yogis.

70
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,560
Because I have heard complaints, people came 
and complained to Me.

71
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,330
And I was amazed.

72
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,380
Those who are just now there, how can they 
start criticizing, other Sahaja Yogis?

73
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,720
That means you who are trying to hit the roots 
of Sahaja Yoga.

74
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,700
And this is not the way you are going to help.

75
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,030
So I have to request you, please, look after 
your own vibrations, look after your own ascent,

76
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,480
look after what you have done for Sahaja Yoga, 
and then talk.

77
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,700
Suddenly, if you just enter into Sahaja Yoga, 
and start criticizing others, about their

78
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,550
innocence, you are hitting the Ganesha at 
the root of it.

79
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,740
So be careful; of course, you’ll be hit, 
no doubt.

80
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,850
And such people, who have done like this, 
I have seen, have ended up with cancer.

81
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,400
Because Ganesha is the one, when He gets angry, 
the first thing you get is cancer.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,170
So be careful, I’m warning you, don’t 
try these tricks anymore.

83
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,010
Try to improve your spirituality, so that 
you can enjoy, the joy of Shri Ganesh.

84
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:54,080
This is one side; the second side is, that 
to keep Shri Ganesha intact we have to have

85
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,900
certain maryadas, everybody must have certain 
maryadas.

86
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,110
Like that, I would say that I would ask a 
lady to put her hand even up to My heart point

87
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,450
from the front.

88
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,700
But I would not ask a man to do that, because 
there is a maryada if you are a man, you are

89
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,480
not supposed to touch My front side, but you 
can touch My backside.

90
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,640
There are maryadas for everything, and if 
you do not observe these maryadas, or these

91
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:33,400
boundaries, then you are apt to get out of 
it, despite the fact that you are pure.

92
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,639
And you might create a problem unnecessarily.

93
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:43,220
I will give a very good example of Shri Mahavira, 
who was the incarnation of Bhairava.

94
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,889
Himself Bhairava took on this work, and to 
Bhairava: ‘What is cloth?’

95
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:47,889
‘What is dress?’

96
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:55,190
I mean He’s a person; to Him the whole universe 
is His clothes, the whole directions are His

97
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,059
clothes, He is the digambara . To Him, what 
does it matter, He’s so innocent.

98
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,889
He’s absolute innocence Himself.

99
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:08,350
And the innocence that is destructive, that 
will destroy, through Him only, you get your

100
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,550
cancer, when you start misbehaving.

101
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,959
So it’s such a simple man like Him, in the 
sense that He never knew what was impurity.

102
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,019
He didn’t know what sin was.

103
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,240
Such a personality came on this earth, to 
teach people to be innocent, to be dharmic,

104
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,660
to be good.

105
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:40,170
Now this one once had to go to some forest 
where half of His cloth got caught up in the

106
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,170
bushes.

107
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,220
So He had to cut it off, and He was left with 
half of the cloth.

108
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:53,709
And when He came out on the village outskirts, 
He met a person, who was actually Shri Krishna,

109
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,809
Who tried to take His pariksha [ED:means’test’], 
just came there, and He said that: ‘Why

110
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,050
should you have any cloth?

111
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,260
There is no need, but I am a human being, 
I’ve no clothes on My body.

112
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,420
So You are a God, You are Incarnation, so 
why don’t You give your cloth to Me?’

113
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
He said: ‘All right, take it.’

114
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,940
He gave away the part that was there.

115
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,870
And that’s how, for a very short time, He 
was without clothes – very short time.

116
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,230
But that people have exploited, and are making 
Him nude, and making all His private parts

117
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,230
insulting.

118
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,649
It’s all nonsense they are doing.

119
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:32,740
Now many people ask Me: ‘How is it that 
Jains indulge into this nudity and all that?’

120
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,459
This is all absurdity; it’s nothing anywhere 
near Mahavira.

121
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,660
Nobody’s a Mahavira to become even nude, 
even for a short time.

122
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,899
So why should they do it?

123
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:51,559
Because everybody tries to find out something 
that is a loophole, just to cover up their

124
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,259
own weaknesses.

125
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,970
And all such weaknesses tell upon the progenies.

126
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:04,220
Now that has gone so far, that they cannot 
understand that Shri Mahavira – He was a

127
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,260
digambara He was a person who did not need 
any clothes.

128
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,490
Still, just to keep the [sounds like: samayachar, 
He did wear His cloth throughout, and later

129
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,670
on also; but for a short time, He gave away 
His clothes.

130
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,480
That doesn’t mean that in the public He 
became nude, and He took out His clothes and

131
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,510
all that, doesn’t mean that.

132
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,750
He respected the public and all that, not 
only but He respected His parents to begin

133
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,709
with, before He took to real sannyasa.

134
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,759
He respected His parents, and He said that: 
‘Now the time has come for Me to give up

135
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,180
this worldly life.

136
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:47,000
I’ve been indulging into worldly affairs, 
and I have to take to sannyasa’ doesn’t

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,920
mean that He was not a sannyasin He was – but 
means that the worldly life of His parents,

138
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,379
and other people, He had to leave.

139
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:00,899
Because if you have to indulge sometimes into 
this life – like in the Hindu tradition,

140
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,009
after certain age, seventy-five they say, 
you have to take a sannyasa, in the sense

141
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:11,790
that your family, your children, are settled 
down now, there’s no problems, so you have

142
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,790
to take a sannyasa.

143
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,410
But for that, the wisdom has to be gathered 
in young age; otherwise, in old age, still

144
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,949
there is no wisdom, and you are behaving like 
a young man of sixteen years – is better

145
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,459
you don’t take sannyasa.

146
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:33,189
So the whole understanding, about life in 
India, has to be very subtle.

147
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:39,639
And to understand these great and great people, 
you have to be little bit greater than what

148
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,819
you are.

149
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:44,720
If you are just mud, how can you see the whole?

150
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,000
You cannot.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
So you have to remove this mud from your eyes.

152
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,819
This is a very common feature in the West 
that, either they are suspicious, or they

153
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:59,759
are ‘indulgent’; there’s nothing in 
between.

154
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,959
Either the people who are suspicious of others, 
or there are people who are indulging into,

155
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,850
so have it [inaudible].

156
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,959
First thing I have to request, because you 
are the first Sahaja Yogis now, who have come

157
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:24,829
for the first time to India, that this soil 
of our country is full of rhythm of Shri Ganesh.

158
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:31,100
You are sitting on it; you have to vow that: 
‘I will establish my Ganesha.’

159
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,619
Don’t worry about others, your attention 
on others.

160
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:40,429
‘I’ll establish my Ganesha, and let this 
Mother earth; give me the full strength to

161
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,429
establish my Shri Ganesha.’

162
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:49,050
This is very important because, unless and 
until your Shri Ganesh is established, you

163
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,350
cannot be connected to the whole.

164
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,920
Nor can you have the enjoyment, of your spirit.

165
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,000
You’ll be a half-baked personality, which 
you should not be.

166
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,600
So far, you can see that the western Sahaja 
Yogis are extremely assiduous.

167
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,920
And they take things very seriously, they 
get to it.

168
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,610
Because, they know, if they have to have joy, 
they have to work it out.

169
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,439
So you have to be a introvert, as far as you 
are concerned.

170
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:23,149
And as far as others are concerned, you have 
to be just seeing the good points of others.

171
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,510
Always see the good points, not the bad points.

172
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,720
Otherwise you’ll create problems for yourself, 
and the day will come, you’ll have to get

173
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,889
out of Sahaja Yoga.

174
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,870
It has happened with many, who tried these 
things.

175
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,480
And they are out, absolutely out of Sahaja 
Yoga.

176
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,339
If you have to be in Sahaja Yoga, you have 
to understand that, to be one with the whole,

177
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,860
try to look after yourself.

178
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,629
Another thing I have told you that in every 
country I have to have somebody on whom I

179
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,629
have to depend.

180
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,089
Just like Shri Ganesha, I depend on Him for 
many things; He looks after many things; In

181
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,989
the same way, in every country, I have to 
have somebody there.

182
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:07,839
I do not like that all the time you are complaining 
about a person with whom I am in connection.

183
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,679
You need not correct them; I’ve told you 
a hundred times, ‘Don’t correct that person.’

184
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,309
I know, because I am in contact, I know about 
that person; you don’t know him.

185
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,290
I know everything about that person.

186
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,689
I can correct that person.

187
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,879
But I was surprised, in London also, some 
people came and said something funny about

188
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,399
others, and I was surprised that they think 
I don’t know.

189
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,759
I know each and everything.

190
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,889
You leave it to Me.

191
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:40,199
It is not your job to do such things, and 
this is very mediocre approach to Sahaja Yoga,

192
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,470
extremely mediocre.

193
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,309
And if you are going to be mediocre, I cannot 
help it.

194
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:47,959
But the day will come; you might have to get 
out of Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:54,379
This is the first warning I want to give you, 
because now we are going to the interior of

196
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,369
Maharashtra.

197
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,889
You will see women and men never sit together 
in Maharashtra, they sit separately, they

198
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,930
keep a distance from them; we must learn those 
things.

199
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,709
In the West we are very open people, it’s 
all right, (inaudible) there are methods and

200
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,819
ways, how we are open, how we keep distances.

201
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:17,629
Like I’ll be much more free with the son 
of [inaudible] Dr. (inaudible) but with him

202
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:19,540
I’ll be a little distance.

203
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,860
It’s a style that, a lady, her elders, she 
must keep her distance.

204
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,139
And a man, must keep a distance from a younger 
generation to him.

205
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,749
This is a system by which, this country has 
worked out its innocence, and we all should

206
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,509
try to follow this point.

207
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:40,010
That keep a distance with the ladies who are 
younger to you.

208
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,604
And keep a distance from the gentlemen who 
are older than you.

209
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:48,660
I mean, there even a eighty-year-old woman 
marries an eighteen-year-old girl.

210
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,490
It’s such a confused state of affairs, where 
you cannot talk of these things.

211
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,429
But here when we are trying to sort out our 
confusions, our mistakes, we should try to

212
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:03,970
adhere to certain pattern which has helped 
our social life – is much better.

213
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,030
And to understand why the social life is better, 
is because of Shri Ganesha’s importance.

214
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,260
Where Shri Ganesha is not there, you’ll 
find even Sahaja Yoga doesn’t [inaudible,

215
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
‘work out’?].

216
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,530
Say in the north of India there is no Shri 
Ganesh much worshipped.

217
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,800
So the Muslims came in, and if Shri Ganesha 
was there, they would have fought.

218
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,950
They accepted Islamic culture, and when that 
culture came in from the Nawabs and all that,

219
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,800
licentious people, it all trickled down.

220
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,890
Not to that extent, still I would say that 
there is a sense of chastity in people in

221
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,800
India, and we all should have that sense of 
chastity.

222
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,550
But the most thing is, that in your heart, 
in your mind; don’t allow funny ideas to

223
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,550
come in.

224
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,090
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

225
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,650
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is 
no good, that man is not good.’

226
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,090
Just don’t listen to these things, just 
listen to yourself that ‘Where am I?

227
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,090
‘What am I doing?’

228
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,360
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

229
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,190
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’

230
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,760
‘Am I helping others?’

231
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,680
‘Where is my attention?’

232
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,240
The attention has to be: ‘What am I doing 
with what Mother has given to me?

233
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,020
So today is a very great day, we must all 
pray to Shri Ganesh that He should give His

234
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,180
blessings, because He’s the source of joy, 
He’s the source of joy, He is Christ, He’s

235
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,480
in your heart, resides as spirit, so He’s 
the one, the innocence you have to achieve.

236
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:41,360
And that is the beginning of Shri Ganesha’s 
being, which evolves at the head here, you

237
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,490
see on this [inaudible] as Aum it becomes.

238
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,450
So the same Shri Ganesha ultimately becomes 
[inaudible, ‘Aum’?] within us.

239
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:59,670
To have the purest form of enjoyment of your 
spirit, you must try to see that you establish

240
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,080
our Shri Ganesha.

241
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,150
And let everyone follow a proper pattern; 
you don’t try to correct each other.

242
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,720
That’s a very wrong attitude in Sahaja Yoga 
and is very detrimental to the growth of Sahaja

243
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Yoga.

244
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,210
Anybody who tries this is thrown out of Sahaja 
Yoga in no time, by some way or some other.

245
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,560
And also I’ve seen people getting cancer, 
and they ask Me: ‘Mother how is it that

246
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,820
we’ve been doing Sahaja Yoga and now we 
get cancer?’

247
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,070
Because of this nonsense.

248
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,030
Don’t try to go against other Sahaja Yogis; 
you must respect them, they are all saints.

249
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,750
And respect the older Sahaja Yogis because 
they have been there, you have to learn a

250
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,750
lot.

251
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,750
They have worked very hard to establish Sahaja 
Yoga.

252
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:49,621
So I have to make a very simple announcement 
today, that on this day of Shri Ganesh, all

253
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:57,730
My children who are born like Shri Ganesha, 
in the same pattern, should become dynamic

254
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:04,350
like Him, innocent like Him, great like Him, 
working twenty-four hours.

255
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:13,210
This little Child is working throughout the 
day and night to give you this source of joy.

256
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,430
May God bless you all.
