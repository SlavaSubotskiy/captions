1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:05,831
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:14,775
At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

3
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:19,536
We cannot change it.

4
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:24,418
We cannot describe it.

5
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:33,400
Unfortunately, at this human awareness, we cannot feel it.

6
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:42,595
Absolute truth has to be felt on you central nervous system.

7
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,624
Now, whatever I am going to tell you tonight,

8
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:58,370
you have to take it not for granted at all.

9
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:05,753
We have had inner problems of blind faith.

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:15,052
But if you treat it as a hypothesis and if it is proved,

11
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:20,878
then you have to accept it as honest people.

12
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:31,333
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect,

13
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:37,307
these emotions, these conditioning and ego.

14
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,337
But you are the pure Spirit.

15
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:55,864
Here now you see beautiful flowers and we take it for granted.

16
00:01:56,446 --> 00:02:01,188
Actually it is a miracle.

17
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:09,494
Many livings things, we take it for granted.

18
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:15,935
Who runs your heart? If you ask the doctor,

19
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,810
he will say: "It is autonomous nervous system."

20
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:25,788
But who is this "auto"?

21
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,100
So the second truth is that

22
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:37,343
there's a All-Pervading Subtle Power of Divine Love

23
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:41,577
that does all the living work.

24
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:54,696
We cannot feel this Power on our fingers, but it exists.

25
00:02:55,393 --> 00:03:00,154
Today for the first time you all are going to feel it.

26
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:08,033
It is called in the Bible as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

27
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:17,500
In the Koran, it is called as Ruh.

28
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:24,413
And in the Indian scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya.

29
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,958
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

30
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:35,614
So in all the books,

31
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:42,417
this Chaitanya has been described by different names.

32
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,853
So "saha" means "with, "ja" means "born",

33
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:55,077
is the right to have this yoga, this union.

34
00:03:55,411 --> 00:04:02,770
You all have this right to have this union with the Divine Power.

35
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:11,149
Specially at this time, it was to happen.

36
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,881
It's already been predicted.

37
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:20,781
They called as Last Judgment,

38
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:24,607
in the Koran they called it as Kyiama.

39
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,906
And the great astrologer, the pioneer of Astrology,

40
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:39,014
Gehrig has written that at this time, thousands will get their enlightenment.

41
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,746
I call it a blossom time,

42
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:48,509
where there are so many seekers of truth

43
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,662
who have a right to get their enlightenment.

44
00:04:55,018 --> 00:05:03,409
So it is through the evolutionary process, the last breakthrough.

45
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:09,524
This Power that connects you to the All-Pervading Power

46
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:15,689
is called as Kundalini.

47
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,880
"Kundal" is different circles.

48
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:30,406
That's why it is called as Kundalini.

49
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,706
It rests in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum,

50
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:43,418
that means that Greeks knew that is a sacred bone.

51
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:53,058
When this Power rises, it passes through six centers.

52
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:59,045
All the problems of the world

53
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:03,958
are mostly from human beings.

54
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,318
And most of the problems of human beings

55
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,019
come from these subtle centers within us.

56
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:19,678
Thus when this Kundalini rises and passes through six centers

57
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,943
and enlightens the fontanel bone area, passes through it,

58
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:31,597
then it enlightens all the centers.

59
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:39,093
It integrates it and also it corrects it.

60
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,132
These centers are for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

61
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:55,460
Thus all our problems

62
00:06:55,661 --> 00:07:02,242
on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being are solved.

63
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,915
In Delhi, there are two doctors who have got their MD

64
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:13,052
for curing incurable diseases in Sahara Yoga.

65
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:22,172
All over the world, we have doctors who are curing people

66
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:26,335
of incurable diseases.

67
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:35,001
The second thing that happens to you that your attention becomes innocent.

68
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,178
Innocence is eternal, it's never lost.

69
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:47,244
Of course there are some clouds on it.

70
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:56,878
But with the awakening of the Kundalini, your innocence is established.

71
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,835
And your attention becomes innocent devoided of lust and greed.

72
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:10,577
Such an innocence, innocent attention is very powerful.

73
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:20,372
And wherever it goes, it emits peace and joy.

74
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:26,392
The another thing that happens to you automatically

75
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:33,132
is that you can feel these centers on your fingertips.

76
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,665
Is not going to people at all, is not,

77
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,648
they can't hear Me.

78
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:50,706
Is alright?

79
00:08:54,308 --> 00:09:04,435
This attention is innocent, but also is active.

80
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:12,114
You can cure your centers by your pure attention.

81
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:20,264
Also you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips.

82
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:24,538
In the Koran, it is written very clearly

83
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:29,148
that at the time of Kyiama, that is the resurrection,

84
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:35,712
your hands will speak and they will give witness against you.

85
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,166
So your attention, whenever you put it,

86
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:47,343
is so pure that it acts on others also.

87
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:51,591
But who is the other?

88
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:59,570
Because you become, you become again collectively conscious,

89
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:04,748
that you can feel the attention of others very clearly

90
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:12,774
on your fingertips, the centers of others on your fingertips.

91
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:20,887
Thus you have self-knowledge on you central nervous system.

92
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:30,926
For example, we go to religion to find out a solution.

93
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:35,746
For example, people like Christ and Mohammed Saab,

94
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:43,717
very highly evolved Incarnations came on this Earth.

95
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:52,339
We could not understand Them and They could not understand human beings.

96
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:56,806
They did not know what sort of people they are facing.

97
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:01,932
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter, Mathews,

98
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:08,445
if your one eye commits a sin, take it down.

99
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:16,852
And if your hand commits a sin, cut it out.

100
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,980
If someone slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek.

101
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,467
I Myself was born in a Christian family

102
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:36,130
and I never see any man doing that without two eyes and without two hands.

103
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,980
Christ was talking to saints.

104
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:45,075
That's why He talked,

105
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:49,424
that He was talking to angels.

106
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,928
And Mohammed Saab was even worse,

107
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,757
because He thought Christ has been very strict on men,

108
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,477
why not on women? So He also said horrible things

109
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:05,785
that have to be done to women.

110
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:10,304
That if a woman looks another man with lust,

111
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,391
she must be buried half in the Mother Earth

112
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:17,717
and should be stoned till she is dead.

113
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:23,785
Imagine what would have happened to American women, I can't understand.

114
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,139
Where they could have been?

115
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:38,721
On top of that, Shariat, which was given by Moses to the Jews,

116
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:42,976
who were very decadent, greed took it over,

117
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:46,753
because Jews defied it.

118
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:52,551
So we can see that these restrictions

119
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:57,002
are for people who are enlightened.

120
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,531
And not for ordinary human beings.

121
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:08,997
So first ordinary human beings have to become enlightened.

122
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:13,587
They have to enter into the Kingdon of God.

123
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,601
There only they can be punished like this.

124
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:26,178
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments.

125
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:31,576
Forgiveness is the only remedy,

126
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:35,413
up to a point.

127
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:41,218
And even after that if people continue to do wrong,

128
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:46,245
then they are requested to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

129
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,993
But once you get enlightenment, you become righteous,

130
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:55,339
nobody has to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that."

131
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:02,132
In the light of the Spirit, you become your guide, your own master.

132
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:07,135
Whatever is destructive, you give up

133
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:11,500
and take to constructive for you life.

134
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,165
This is like this, supposing I am an obstinate person

135
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:20,241
and I have a snake in My hand and there's darkness.

136
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:23,777
And you tell Me that there's a snake,

137
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:29,517
but I will not give up because I am obstinate till the snake bites Me.

138
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:34,975
But if there's a little light, immediately I will Myself give up.

139
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,270
Nobody has to tell Me.

140
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:44,190
You yourself become virtuous and righteous.

141
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:53,458
So your health becomes first class, your mind becomes first class,

142
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:59,472
because of that, your financial problems are also solved.

143
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:05,814
We actually live in a relative world.

144
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:12,432
Either we are thinking about the past or about the future.

145
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:17,308
We are jumping on the cusp of this thoughts.

146
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:21,954
But past is finished and future doesn't exist.

147
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,557
We have to be in the present.

148
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:30,938
And that is very difficult.

149
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,178
When Kundalini rises

150
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:42,167
She elongates those thoughts and our attention stands in the middle.

151
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:46,966
And we become thoughtlessly aware.

152
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,706
Means you are fully aware, but there's no thought

153
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,441
from the future and the past.

154
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,242
That is the time you grow spiritually

155
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:01,821
and we get inspirations from the Divine.

156
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:10,411
So we are in the present, which is the reality.

157
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,615
And we know the reality, we become absolutely confident.

158
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:23,194
Now the another thing that is very remarkable is that

159
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:27,715
you know the absolute truth.

160
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:32,322
That too on your fingertips.

161
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:37,746
,Many people don't believe that there is God.

162
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:43,501
Many people don't believe that Christ was the Son of God.

163
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,379
But after enlightened, you just put your hands like this

164
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,072
and ask the question: "Is there God?".

165
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:57,672
And you feel a tremendous cool breeze flowing.

166
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:02,572
Supposing there is a man false who comes and meets you,

167
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,654
you just put your hands towards that person

168
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:11,097
and you immediately will know what sort of a person he is.

169
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:18,190
By recording the sensations on your central nervous system

170
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:25,290
which is indicated on your fingertips, you can know everything.

171
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:33,624
Such a person is blessed by the Divine Power.

172
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:39,030
To such an extent that once they get Realization,

173
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:44,673
they write letters to Me what miracles have happened to them.

174
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,250
I've told somebody: "You better compile", and within one month,

175
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:53,446
he telephoned to Me that: "They have come up over my head,

176
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:57,701
I don't know what to select."

177
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:01,689
When you become thoughtlessly aware,

178
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,171
you become absolutely peaceful within yourself.

179
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:12,259
I have seen people have got awards of peace,

180
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,919
but what I know that they have no peace within themselves.

181
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:26,274
And if you have to meet them, better take a barge pole.

182
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:30,582
They are so hot-tempered.

183
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,892
So egoistical and arrogant.

184
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:42,107
How can you have peace if you have no peace within yourself?

185
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:47,661
With Sahaja Yoga, it has been created

186
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:55,111
a new race of extremely peaceful, loving, dynamic people.

187
00:18:55,343 --> 00:19:00,381
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

188
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:03,464
Of course in India is not difficult,

189
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:08,793
but Russia has been a wonderful place for Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:15,199
Russians are extremely sensitive to spirituality.

191
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,790
At least 65 to 70%.

192
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:27,616
The rest are materialistic, they want Malboro cigarette and all kinds of things.

193
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,973
But they are all very well educated

194
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:36,482
and this people has such a sense of spirituality.

195
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:40,586
For example, Saint Petersburg University,

196
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:44,370
which is one of the oldest universities,

197
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:50,325
gave Me an award of Honorary Academician.

198
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,881
And the tenth person to get it so far.

199
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:01,791
And one of them is Einstein.

200
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,341
And I was surprised, I asked them: "How do you put Me

201
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:09,768
in the same line as Einstein?"

202
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:13,530
So they said: "What Einstein has done is on the matter,"

203
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:17,886
but You can work on human beings."

204
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:24,403
In that conference there were two thousand great scientists.

205
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:34,651
And they gave the subject of Medicine and Self-knowledge.

206
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:40,621
But there were many others who spoke on morality and health.

207
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:49,017
Morality has become a prime subject for these people.

208
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,965
I was surprised scientist talking of morality.

209
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,197
Because science is unmoral.

210
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:08,099
And that is what they said that there is a gap with the science.

211
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:16,499
I must tell you that I've been there only four times

212
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,075
and in one place only, one place called Tolyatti,

213
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:26,279
we have 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

214
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:30,406
There is a joke that they went once

215
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:36,674
and one of the Toliatti Sahaja Yogi asked an American one:

216
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,870
"How many Sahaja Yogis you have in America?"

217
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:45,571
He said: "There are fifty-six."

218
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,428
So a Toliatti Sahaja Yogi said: "Oh my God,

219
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:54,710
"you have 56.000, we have 21.000 only in Toliatti."

220
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:00,387
Because Americans lack maturity.

221
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,975
They lack wisdom.

222
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:08,350
They live like Hollywood actors and actresses,

223
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,872
in the imaginary world.

224
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:19,164
Like a one lady married eight times

225
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:25,318
and ninth time she was going with a very young man for her honeymoon.

226
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:33,311
And there were four, five thousand people just to see her going for her honeymoon.

227
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:38,487
Not only that, but there were ten helicopters from where

228
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:42,807
there were parachute down taking photographs

229
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,385
They fell on people and some on trees.

230
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:52,380
I must say India may be a poor country, but you won't get

231
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:57,548
even one person to see such idiotic things.

232
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:03,073
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots

233
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:07,985
and for superficial people.

234
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:12,592
It is of course not meant for arrogant.

235
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:18,609
But it is meant for people who are true seekers of truth.

236
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:23,013
In this seeking, people do go to wrong things.

237
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:27,498
They have gone to false gurus, doesn't matter.

238
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:33,205
You should know that we cannot pay for your enlightenment.

239
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,908
God doesn't know money. He doesn't understand banking,

240
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:42,017
that is our headache.

241
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:46,335
So, if somebody ask money for your enlightenment,

242
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:51,600
you better understand that he is a cheat.

243
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:58,303
Also enlightenment doesn't mean some sort of a dressing up

244
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:03,064
or shaving your hair.

245
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:08,361
A great poet Kabira has said: "If by shaving your hair,

246
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:10,562
if you are going to get your Nirvana,

247
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:17,601
then the sheep who it is shaved every year will go there first."

248
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,093
This time in Chicago, you will be surprised,

249
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:28,669
I saw a Hare Rama fellow, the leader who came with a dot,

250
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,209
that you wear, very light cloth.

251
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:41,080
It was really very cold and as a Mother, I felt concern what is he after all.

252
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,559
Then I asked him: "Why you are wearing a dot? It is so very cold,

253
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,931
you will get troubles."

254
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:53,401
So he said that "My guru has initiated

255
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:58,924
and I am supposed to wear only dot, whether it is cold or not."

256
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:04,894
And he said, "That is how it is I am going to get my Nirvana."

257
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:09,259
I said, "In India, 80% people wear dots,

258
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,475
if they are going to get Nirvana, then where you will be?"

259
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:18,156
There is another really shocking thing.

260
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:24,732
In Cabella, one fellow came and he told Me, that "I have become a very poor man,

261
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:30,147
because all my money I have given to Dalai Lama."

262
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:37,913
So in the name of God, how many types of people there are who are cheating,

263
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:44,574
I have to tell you all these things because I am your Mother.

264
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,621
I am not afraid of them.

265
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:52,129
I am only afraid that you people are great seekers

266
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,941
and you should not be lost.

267
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,479
Guru Nanak has said, "The one who is a real master

268
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,608
is the one who makes you meet the Divine."

269
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:12,111
Christ also said that "You are to be born again."

270
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:17,929
In Sanskrit, we have the word called "dwija" for a bird

271
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,098
and also for an enlighten soul.

272
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:30,427
That means a person who is born again like the bird.

273
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:36,994
The bird is first an egg and then it becomes a bird,

274
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:41,460
it has a second birth.

275
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:45,530
In the same way, we have to have our second birth,

276
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:49,858
where you get complete transformation.

277
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:54,305
As it is, several people have that,

278
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:59,271
"we are born again, we are Christians, Hindus, Muslims",

279
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:03,534
these are nothing but brands.

280
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:07,594
You maybe are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

281
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:13,912
but you can commit any mistake and can commit any sin.

282
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:19,777
In Sahaja Yoga, you become, becoming is the point.

283
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:24,999
And when the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area,

284
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,887
is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

285
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:34,971
It is the experience of feeling the Divine.

286
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:41,371
Is not a lecture or it is not a sermon.

287
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:46,624
But the greatest thing that happens to you

288
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:50,865
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

289
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:58,655
Happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin.

290
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,243
But joy is singular.

291
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:10,684
Where you become the source of peace

292
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:15,108
and you witness the whole world as a drama.

293
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:22,127
But you yourself become the light of peace and joy.

294
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:27,697
Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations now.

295
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:32,718
And I am amazed that I've never seen anybody quarreling,

296
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,145
fighting or even arguing.

297
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:42,024
They all enjoy each others company.

298
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:46,059
Such pure love, friendship

299
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,471
that you really feel a new age has started.

300
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:57,954
Very pure relationships of husband and wife, sisters, brothers,

301
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,936
I've never heard somebody running away with somebody's wife

302
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:05,543
or somebody's husband in Sahaja Yoga.

303
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:13,923
I really know there are so many great
souls who want to be born on this Earth.

304
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:22,701
And if they are born to non Sahaja Yogi, they will never understand their children.

305
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:29,600
Moreover they are anxious to be born to Sahaja Yogis.

306
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:37,446
In this lecture, I cannot tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, I'm sorry.

307
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:44,479
Only in English language, I must have addressed five thousand lectures so far.

308
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:50,270
But it is like this, we have so many beautiful lights here.

309
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:56,620
And we have to just put on one switch and all the lights come in.

310
00:29:57,681 --> 00:30:01,892
Because it is built in.

311
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:06,234
In the same way, it is built in within you.

312
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:11,035
This is your own power.

313
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:15,431
This is your own glory.

314
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:20,329
All your protection powers will manifest.

315
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:27,641
So many artists, musicians have become world famous today.

316
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,631
You will be happy to know this time, Miss Universe was a Sahaja Yogini.

317
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:40,340
She is going to see Me and she said, "I don't want to wear funny dresses."

318
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:44,431
I said, "No, you can wear, if you can wear swimming dresses,

319
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:48,839
is alright, doesn't matter, you go ahead."

320
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,000
She is a very simple, intelligent girl.

321
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,337
I wouldn't say she is a beauty or anything

322
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:01,907
according to Hollywood standards.

323
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:08,517
But her innocence and her pose or her intelligence

324
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:15,320
has achieved this wisdom for her that she is today Miss Universe.

325
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:19,819
So is a very remarkable thing that we don't know

326
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:26,582
what qualities we have, what potential we have, how dynamic people we are.

327
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:31,231
It is like a candle which is not get enlightened

328
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:38,034
but a enlightened candle can enlighten the one which is not enlightened.

329
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:45,756
This is like is a seed, if it is embedded in the Mother Earth,

330
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:50,792
it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja.

331
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,633
Because the seed as well the Mother Earth

332
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:59,177
has the built in quality to sprout.

333
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,909
So believe Me, all of you have got this.

334
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,245
And it will work out.

335
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,843
Please have no doubts about yourself.

336
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:19,719
Another thing is that this Power that is in the triangular bone

337
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,623
is the Power of Pure Desire.

338
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:29,420
All desires are not pure.

339
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:33,813
You want to have house today, then you want to have a car,

340
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:39,707
then want to have a helicopter, I don't know, goes on like that.

341
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:43,197
There is no end.

342
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:50,354
According to economics: wants are not satiable in general.

343
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:59,458
Because they are not pure wants, pure desires.

344
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,814
So you should have full confidence and also should have

345
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:09,724
desire to be one with the Divine Power.

346
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:15,778
I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it.

347
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:21,751
Because I respect your freedom.

348
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:27,101
This Power is your individual Mother.

349
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:32,004
She knows everything about you.

350
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:37,319
Like a tape recorder, She knows what are your desires,

351
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,527
what are your aspirations.

352
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,876
And She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

353
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:53,668
And as when you were born, your mother took all the troubles,

354
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:58,547
this Mother of yours takes all the trouble

355
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:03,841
and you get your Self-Realization.

356
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:10,783
It will hardly take fifteen minutes.

357
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:16,805
But those who don't want to have it should leave the hall.

358
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:20,711
Because they cannot get it also.

359
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:24,982
On the contrary, they will disturb you.

360
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:31,197
If you have faith in yourself, I'm sure it will work out.

361
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:35,492
You have to respect yourself,

362
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:42,092
Because you are a human being at epitome of evolution.

363
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,460
Now as I told you

364
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:02,380
that this Kundalini, your Mother, knows everything about you.

365
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:07,656
Please do not judge yourself.

366
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:12,951
She knows, She judges you.

367
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:22,325
So first condition is that you should not feel guilty at all.

368
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:30,035
Whatever has happen in the past has happen.

369
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:38,938
Why carry the guilty on your left side, this center?

370
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:46,438
As a result of this mythical behaviour, you get spondylitis,

371
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,564
or you get angina,

372
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:53,223
or you get lethargic organs.

373
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:59,051
You might even get diseases like tuberculosis.

374
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:04,042
So why to carry this myth of guilt?

375
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:10,974
You have to really forgive yourself.

376
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:15,698
And should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

377
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:19,894
Even in My lecture, if you think that I have said something

378
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:24,337
that makes you feel guilty, forget it.

379
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:30,347
The second condition is even simpler

380
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,832
if you understand it.

381
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:38,728
You have to forgive everyone

382
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:42,694
even without thinking about them,

383
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:47,522
because it is a headache to think about it.

384
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:54,660
Now, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do?

385
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,396
You don't do anything.

386
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:06,315
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

387
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:13,345
All your life, you tortured yourself.

388
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:18,096
But at this moment is important to get this center

389
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:24,409
and the center in the optic chiasma opened out.

390
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:31,094
If you feel guilty, this center won't open and the Kundalini won't pass through.

391
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:38,854
But the worst is the center on the optic chiasma which is constricted like this.

392
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,327
And it won't open unless and until

393
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:47,528
you forgive everyone without thinking about them.

394
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:53,787
As it is you are playing into wrong hands and by not forgiving

395
00:37:53,988 --> 00:38:00,332
you will miss the most important thing that is your enlightenment.

396
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:10,872
Third condition is very simpler that I request you to get out your shoes

397
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:15,951
I'm sorry I have to say that because in England, first time I said:

398
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,485
"Please take out your shoes", half of them left the hall.

399
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:33,352
This help us to be in contact with the Mother Earth,

400
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:38,193
which help us a lot.

401
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:48,201
Now, you don't say any prays, any mantras, nothing.

402
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:53,283
Please don't try to concentrate.

403
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:58,908
Kundalini Itself will take your attention upward.

404
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:03,508
Alright.

405
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,816
Those who are sitting on the ground are alright.

406
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:17,090
But those who are sitting on the chair have to keep

407
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,595
both their feet apart from each other.

408
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:27,667
Please all of you do it, otherwise you can go.

409
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:40,165
Because the left and right are two powers.

410
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:46,559
The left one is the power of desire

411
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:52,790
And the right one is the power of action.

412
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:02,017
First we tell you how to nourish your center with your self-confidence.

413
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:04,675
These exercises have to be done only for tonight,

414
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:09,586
afterwards you don't have to do anything.

415
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,672
Now, so please put your left hand towards Me

416
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:18,694
like this on your lap very comfortably sitting.

417
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:25,543
Why he is not doing himself there? What is the matter with you?

418
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:31,067
If you don't want to do, you can go out.

419
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:37,523
obstinate.

420
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:48,960
Alright. Now please understand that

421
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:52,547
you have to be comfortable in your chair,

422
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:57,509
but not slouch, not put one foot on top of other,

423
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,275
but comfortably sitting.

424
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:08,693
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head.

425
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:13,192
You don't have to give up anything.

426
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:19,339
I have told you it is not outside, but inside something has to happen.

427
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:24,109
So please put your left hand on your lap,

428
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:32,435
which is symbolizing that you have a desire to have your Self-Realization.

429
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:38,396
Now put your right hand on your heart.

430
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:48,015
We use our right hand for nourishing our centers on the left hand side.

431
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:52,212
In the heart resides the Spirit.

432
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,413
Please put left hand towards Me, try to understand,

433
00:41:54,614 --> 00:42:00,092
left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart, please.

434
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:09,400
Now, we put our hand on the heart, where resides the Spirit.

435
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,788
Now we take our right hand to the upper portion of abdomen

436
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:19,790
on the left hand side.

437
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:27,140
I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your master.

438
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:35,512
So this is the center of your mastery, which is created by prophets and seers.

439
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:43,355
Now, we take our right hand to the lower portion of abdomen

440
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:47,556
on the left hand side.

441
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:56,605
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine knowledge.

442
00:42:57,347 --> 00:43:03,503
Now we take it up again in the upper portion of your abdomen.

443
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:08,770
Then we take it on our heart.

444
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,453
Then in the corner of the neck and shoulder

445
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:16,646
and turn our head to right.

446
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:21,582
I've already told you about this center.

447
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:24,132
And quite that is in today with you,

448
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:29,061
please don't feel guilty at all.

449
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:34,098
I tell you, you have done nothing wrong.

450
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:37,011
After all you are human beings and only human beings

451
00:43:37,212 --> 00:43:41,533
can commit mistakes, you are not gods.

452
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:49,036
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no confession and there's no guilty.

453
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:54,277
Is only love, compassion and forgiveness.

454
00:43:55,002 --> 00:44:05,033
Now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

455
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:13,859
Here you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

456
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:20,199
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

457
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,830
just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

458
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:29,321
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

459
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,312
So take back your right hand on the back side of your head.

460
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:38,732
This is the center for asking forgiveness.

461
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:44,438
Now the last center, you have to stretch your palm fully.

462
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:50,195
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area,

463
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:57,132
which is a soft bone (...) your scalp.

464
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,663
Now please, put down your head.

465
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:05,919
And move your scalp seven times slowly.

466
00:45:06,364 --> 00:45:10,539
That is all you have to do.

467
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,771
Now you have to close your eyes.

468
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:20,965
Before that, see that you put your both the feet apart from each other

469
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:25,321
and your left hand on your lap.

470
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:46,753
Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

471
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,870
Take down your hands now.

472
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,441
And now put your right hand on your heart.

473
00:46:08,252 --> 00:46:11,036
Close your eyes.

474
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:16,244
Now, here your have to ask Me a very fundamental question

475
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:20,290
about yourself.

476
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:34,860
You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

477
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:42,566
So please say three times, ask a question:

478
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,876
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

479
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:05,947
I have told already to you that if you become the Spirit,

480
00:47:06,147 --> 00:47:11,108
you become your own master.

481
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:21,161
So please take your right hand upper portion of you abdomen

482
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,846
on the left hand side.

483
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:33,849
And here, you have to ask another fundamental question

484
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:38,048
about yourself three times.

485
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:46,471
Please ask Me in your heart three times:

486
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:51,690
"Mother, am I my own master?"

487
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,484
Now,

488
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:13,305
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

489
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:24,385
And I cannot force on you the Pure Divine Knowledge.

490
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:32,290
You have to ask for it.

491
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:38,818
So please put down your hand in the left hand side of your abdomen,

492
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:48,117
in the lower region.

493
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:55,629
Here you ask again six times because this center has got six petals.

494
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:08,820
Here you have to ask: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge."

495
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:25,765
Now, as soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge,

496
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:30,707
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

497
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:44,382
So we have to nourish upper centers with your self-confidence.

498
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:52,958
Please now put your right hand the upper portion of your abdomen

499
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,210
on the left hand side.

500
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:10,261
Here you have to say ten times with your full self-confidence:

501
00:50:10,462 --> 00:50:14,876
"Mother, I am my own master."

502
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:37,748
At very outset, I told you that you are not this body, this mind,

503
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:43,654
this intellect, these emotions, your ego or your conditionings,

504
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:48,292
but you are the pure Spirit.

505
00:50:58,878 --> 00:51:02,482
So now please raise your hand on your heart

506
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:07,785
and say again with full self-confidence twelve times:

507
00:51:07,986 --> 00:51:12,487
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

508
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:29,653
This All-Pervading Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge

509
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:33,783
of bliss.

510
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:47,244
Ocean of bliss.

511
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:56,517
It is the ocean of compassion and love.

512
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:06,009
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

513
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,864
So whatever mistakes your might have committed

514
00:52:12,064 --> 00:52:19,392
can be easily dissolved in the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

515
00:52:26,703 --> 00:52:31,683
So please, forgive yourself.

516
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:36,151
And put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

517
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:40,336
and push your neck to your right.

518
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:54,047
Here you have to say, again, with full self-confidence sixteen times:

519
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:59,319
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

520
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:23,562
I have already told you that you have to forgive everyone.

521
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:34,124
Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

522
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:45,252
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

523
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:58,360
So it is very important to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

524
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:09,236
Leave them to the Divine Power to deal.

525
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:21,962
Then you all raise your hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head.

526
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:35,744
Here you have to say from your heart not how many times:

527
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:47,812
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

528
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:54,647
At this moment, if you don't forgive,

529
00:54:54,847 --> 00:54:58,897
then this center which is so constricted won't open

530
00:54:59,097 --> 00:55:03,307
and the Kundalini cannot pass through it.

531
00:55:12,796 --> 00:55:17,878
Now without feeling guilty, without pointing your mistakes,

532
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:23,042
for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

533
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:27,476
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

534
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:39,190
So please take your right hand back side of your head

535
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,780
and push back your head as far as possible.

536
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:55,758
Here you have to say, again, from your heart, not how many times:

537
00:55:55,958 --> 00:56:03,071
"Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong

538
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:07,308
knowingly or unknowingly.

539
00:56:24,627 --> 00:56:30,447
Now the last center, which is very important.

540
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:39,022
You have to stretch your hand fully, the palm fully

541
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:47,774
and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area,

542
00:56:47,974 --> 00:56:53,037
it was a soft bone in your childhood.

543
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:08,769
Now please put down your head.

544
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:15,363
Please stretch your fingers outward.

545
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:24,499
Here again I cannot force enlightenment on you,

546
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:28,965
you have to ask for it.

547
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:39,311
So now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise,

548
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:46,965
saying seven times: "Mother, please give me my Self-Realization."

549
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:35,375
Now please take down your hands.

550
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:42,203
And open your eyes slowly.

551
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:47,516
Put both the hands towards Me like this.

552
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:54,633
And watch Me without thinking.

553
00:59:02,564 --> 00:59:08,728
Now please put your right hand towards Me like this.

554
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:15,650
And put down your head.

555
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:23,096
See with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations

556
00:59:23,296 --> 00:59:29,366
coming from your fontanel bone area

557
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:40,497
Please bend your head.

558
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:47,197
And don't put your hand on top of the head, but away from it, near it.

559
00:59:53,276 --> 00:59:59,424
Now please turn, put the left hand towards Me like this.

560
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:07,829
Again bend your head and see with the right hand,

561
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,332
if there is a hot or a cool breeze like vibrations

562
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:20,368
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

563
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:31,602
Some people get it further.

564
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:40,641
But if it is hot, then you have not forgiven yourself

565
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:45,534
or your have not forgiven others, so please do that now.

566
01:00:53,388 --> 01:00:57,693
Now again, lastly, put your right hand towards Me

567
01:00:57,894 --> 01:01:02,071
and try to feel if there is any cool or hot breeze

568
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:06,370
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

569
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:29,635
Now do not doubt you, is coming from your own head.

570
01:01:36,555 --> 01:01:40,578
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

571
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,690
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this

572
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:51,969
and push back your head.

573
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:05,554
Here you have to ask a question three times

574
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:09,784
anyone of these three questions.

575
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,882
Please ask, first question:

576
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:22,714
"Mother, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

577
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:38,411
Second question: "Mother, is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love, the Ruh?

578
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:49,436
Or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

579
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:59,304
Ask anyone of these three questions, anyone three times.

580
01:03:03,685 --> 01:03:08,154
Now take down your hands.

581
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:23,401
All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips

582
01:03:23,601 --> 01:03:29,237
or on their palm or out of their fontanel bone area,

583
01:03:29,437 --> 01:03:34,655
even maybe hot, please raise both your hands.

584
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:52,887
Brazil! I bow to you all the saints of Brazil.

585
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:57,220
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

586
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:08,448
Specially Brasilia.

587
01:04:08,648 --> 01:04:12,711
May God bless you.

588
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:33,654
Please, one thing I have to tell you clearly,

589
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:42,545
that whatever has happen to you is a collective happening.

590
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,261
You can only grow collectively,

591
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:58,214
not in your homes, but you have to come to the collective.

592
01:05:01,925 --> 01:05:06,292
You don't have to pay for anything.

593
01:05:08,378 --> 01:05:11,389
As you know that we don't take any money,

594
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:17,487
we don't have elaborate places, we are humble.

595
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:32,391
So please make it a point to respect your Self-Realization.

596
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:46,294
You don't have to pay, but you have to respect your Self-Realization

597
01:05:46,494 --> 01:05:50,633
and give little time to it.

598
01:05:57,976 --> 01:06:04,015
If you have any problems, they can be solved in the collective.

599
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:11,411
Also they will tell you all about how to meditate,

600
01:06:11,611 --> 01:06:15,627
hardly for ten minutes everyday.

601
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:25,200
Gradually you will come to know everything and within one month time,

602
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,182
you can become a master of Sahaja Yoga.

603
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,508
You will have powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

604
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,267
You will have powers to cure others.

605
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:55,721
There are so many powers of love and compassion and dynamism,

606
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:05,680
that you will get the answer which science cannot give you,

607
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,482
why are you on this Earth?

608
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:21,071
Firstly you enter into the Kingdom of God

609
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:27,349
and secondly to be the channel of this All-Pervading Power.

610
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:39,595
This is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family,

611
01:07:39,795 --> 01:07:46,896
for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

612
01:07:53,581 --> 01:07:58,113
Thus we can create a very peaceful world.

613
01:08:01,191 --> 01:08:05,800
And this is the Truth you have been seeking.

614
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:13,194
May God bless you all.

615
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:17,996
Thank you very much.
