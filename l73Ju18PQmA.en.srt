1
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:53,158
Today it's a great day for us, for all the
Sahaja Yogis that on this day, I would say

2
00:10:53,253 --> 00:11:10,893
we are late by one day or two days, the Sahasrara
was opened out.

3
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:28,950
It was just a miracle I should say because
I didn't think that I am at a point where

4
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,171
it could be done.

5
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:51,671
So I wanted to wait but some things happened
that made Me think that it has to be open.

6
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:13,307
It was
in such a situation that I felt if I delayed

7
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:27,393
any more now, it may help these false gurus
to spread their nonsense all over.

8
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:41,863
This is just I should say, is a Sahaj way
of doing things.

9
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:46,703
Now 25 years have passed.

10
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:54,086
You all have gathered during this time, and
we have so many others who are not here, who

11
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:59,170
have achieved so many things.

12
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:09,532
But perhaps, we are not aware as to what we
have achieved in the real sense of the word.

13
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:13,481
You've got your vibrations.

14
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:19,272
You can feel this All Pervading Power.

15
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:25,811
You are as they say, swimming in the ocean
of joy.

16
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:37,922
You are all enjoying the collectivity, and
that you have transcended many of your limitations.

17
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:45,576
All this has happened to you because it is
your right to have it.

18
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:49,689
I don't take any credit for it.

19
00:13:49,689 --> 00:14:02,157
Only thing all the time I've been pointing
it out to you one thing that now, you have

20
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:09,221
entered into the Kingdom of God, and enjoy
yourself.

21
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:13,420
We have to see around ourselves.

22
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:20,560
The whole nature enjoys itself; doesn't bother,
doesn't bother about anything.

23
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,333
They haven't got realization.

24
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:27,167
They haven't felt the Paramachaitanya.

25
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:33,195
But how is it they know that we have to enjoy?

26
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:41,434
The flowers that come out for a short time
and fade out, but as long as they live,

27
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,275
they're very happy.

28
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,932
They don't think of their past or of their
future, but they enjoy the present.

29
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:57,700
And in the present, they enjoy what is - that
they are fragrant

30
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,768
and giving fragrance to others.

31
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:03,816
They're beautiful and they are soothing others.

32
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:06,656
The whole nature is like that.

33
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:16,338
If you look at the birds or anything that
we call as natural is all sort of

34
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,419
in a meditative mood.

35
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:25,041
All these hills, and big, big mountains.

36
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:33,440
They look as if they are witness to whatever
has been happening.

37
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:42,680
Now we have to really first look back what
we have achieved.

38
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:51,105
That is important, because if you're climbing
up on a hill, if you look back,

39
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,185
 you get a shock and you may fall down.

40
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:58,349
So normally people say, never look back.

41
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:10,469
But a person who has earned some treasure,
he again and again goes and counts it and

42
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:18,180
finds out how much he has got, and every time
he sees that, he enjoys.

43
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:27,399
So to know relatively what we have got and
how we have achieved something will definitely

44
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:37,570
give you greater strength of mind and richness
of life.

45
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:45,190
The first thing that has happened to you I
would say it is very important is this - that

46
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:49,420
you have felt this All Pervading Power.

47
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:59,090
That shows that you must have been great seekers
of truth, honest, sincere, sensible.

48
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:12,969
That just coming to My program you felt the
vibrations, and after that you started settling

49
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,029
down into it.

50
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:22,839
So many of you have felt it suddenly, and
they were amazed and they were shocked and

51
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:29,330
surprised, and they wanted to test whether
it is true or not.

52
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:38,310
But then you were confident, you found it
that you've got definitely a new dimension

53
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:48,270
in your life, and that you are feeling this
All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

54
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,930
I'll take one lecture sufficient to describe
this All Pervading Power.

55
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:05,609
But what you got out of it is the essence
of it, one has to know, is a complete freedom.

56
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,387
You have achieved your complete freedom.

57
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:15,838
First of all, the freedom has come to you,
first of all, most important,

58
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,776
is from your ego.

59
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:24,127
This wall of ego you have crossed.

60
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:37,191
You have got out of the bondage of this ego,
which was really so much full of

61
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,446
problems for you.

62
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:45,770
So many things this ego does of which you
are not aware.

63
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:51,987
Firstly, a person who is egoist doesn't mind
hurting anyone.

64
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:58,125
He hurts, but if he's hurt, he doesn't like
it.

65
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,757
Immediately start crying.

66
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:07,542
Specially I've seen people who have too much
ego are very easily hurt, but they don't understand

67
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:20,287
how many people they have hurt already, and
how many are really frightened of such a person.

68
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:24,473
So you got rid of your ego.

69
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:32,459
It is sinful to hurt any other human being
for anything; for whatever may be the reason

70
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:35,916
that you feel you should hurt another one.

71
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:43,622
The first is the revenge; the idea of revenge
is there, that I must take a revenge on the

72
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:54,513
person who has hurt me or has done some wrong
to me or something of that kind.

73
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,771
This idea of revenge comes when you react.

74
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,362
Some react very violently.

75
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:09,678
I have seen people murdering each other in
the name of revenge, killing their own kith

76
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:17,656
and kin, killing their fellow men, their country
men, all over the world is some sort of a

77
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:22,937
stupid idea of revenge.

78
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:28,316
But if you go to the subtle side of revenge,
what is it?

79
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:30,576
What revenge have you taken?

80
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:33,301
Supposing there is somebody who has troubled
you.

81
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:37,902
You are angry with that person and you have
killed that person, so you have actually

82
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,386
saved him.

83
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:47,187
He won't have to suffer from guilty conscience,
it won't have to do anything, it's just finished.

84
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,583
What is the revenge is?

85
00:20:50,092 --> 00:21:00,016
The revenge should be only by which a person
gets out of his idea of killing others.

86
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:05,588
Like a sword never fights a sword, it fights
the shield.

87
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:18,533
In the same way, the revenge that we think
we can take on another person is not a revenge,

88
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:25,637
because any action you take in the name of
revenge comes back to you

89
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:27,955
and hurts you much more.

90
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:34,300
So many things can happen if a person in the
name of revenge starts acting.

91
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,772
Now for example, these days you know in the
whole world,

92
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,225
 there's so much of revenge going on,

93
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:49,387
even in the name of God; taking revenge
because certain people are following some

94
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:54,957
religion, or they are doing something else
that you are doing.

95
00:21:54,982 --> 00:22:02,032
Working out this kind of a revenge, what has
happening is that you are just killing people,

96
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:09,007
destroying them, who do not even understand
what sort of a revenge you are taking.

97
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:15,696
People are putting bombs and putting all kinds
of things and by that thousands of innocent

98
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:20,932
people one is killing; so what kind of a revenge
have you taken?

99
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:24,182
They don't deserve any revenge.

100
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:31,991
So this revenge when it explodes can destroy
so many innocent people and it will definitely

101
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,136
react on you.

102
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,227
You cannot get away with it.

103
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:43,301
It's a very long process of this revenge.

104
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:54,003
I've told you about Bermuda Triangle what
they say, that so many blacks were taken slaves

105
00:22:54,028 --> 00:23:01,685
and were drowned in that area, so their spirits
they are saying, are haunting on the people

106
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,586
who are passing by; mostly the whites and
they just drowned.

107
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:13,928
So it's a very long process, and all that
I need not discuss at this auspicious occasion,

108
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:20,241
but I have to say that when we take a revenge,
every action has a reaction.

109
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:29,007
So somehow you have got out of that idea of
revenge, just out of that idea.

110
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:38,077
There's another thing that if you don't take
revenge, and leave it to God, It acts.

111
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:49,614
It acts, not only that, but a Divine Power
takes into Its own control how to really give

112
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:58,665
a good lesson to that person or to that community
or to that kind of organization which is taking

113
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,753
a revenge on you.

114
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:06,361
You don't have to worry.

115
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:10,111
I'll have to tell you that in this 25 years
I've seen,

116
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:12,900
 people have been extremely unkind to me.

117
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:20,222
Many organizations, many so called religions,
and all kinds of things have been after us.

118
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,444
Media has been after us.

119
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,730
Take the example of French media.

120
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:34,583
They tried to trouble us so much and tried
to bring bad name to us, doesn't matter.

121
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:42,014
The media people now, three of them who went
to India, are now under warrant and if they

122
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:46,683
go to India, they will be arrested.

123
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,143
I didn't do anything.

124
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,924
We didn't do anything.

125
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:59,639
Secondly, the same media, I mean the same
newspapers are all bankrupt.

126
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,157
You didn't do anything about it.

127
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:04,916
You didn't go and say that they should become
bankrupt.

128
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:06,067
You didn't take any revenge.

129
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:07,370
Why should we?

130
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:09,771
Why should we take any revenge?

131
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:17,595
Because we are not bothered as to what happens;
we are not bothered as to what these people

132
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,794
have done to us.

133
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:27,364
But legally they are now involved in such
a way that they are under warrant and if they

134
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:30,344
go to India, they'll be arrested.

135
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:37,664
And the whole of French government is with
them, all of them are trying so much, but

136
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:41,273
this punishment is on their head.

137
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,372
In their lifetime, they didn't have to die
or anything;

138
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:48,380
 in their lifetime they have got it.

139
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:56,888
So you have got this special power that you
don't have to take revenge or you have to

140
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:58,353
just forgive.

141
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:07,367
Just forgive and the forgiveness will look
after the whole arrangement of how to bring

142
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:13,213
the other person to its proper path.

143
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:23,203
So once you are out of this idea of revenge,
you really feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful

144
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:30,228
because this peace that you have within yourself
is not unnatural, it's not mental, but its

145
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,733
just happens to you.

146
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,727
It's all right.

147
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,808
So what if they have said, they have done
anything wrong to us?

148
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,675
Why should we bother?

149
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:45,244
So many things are there which I can tell
you have worked out automatically.

150
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:55,642
Now in Turkey they told Me that there is some
boy who is from England and he went and told

151
00:26:55,667 --> 00:27:00,764
the media something against Sahaja Yoga and
it was all published.

152
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:06,463
But in the court he confessed that, "Whatever
I said was wrong."

153
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:10,449
Nobody went and told him, nobody threatened
him, nothing happened.

154
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:18,258
So from your point of view you must understand,
that you're not going to get into any mess

155
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:25,778
of taking revenge of any kind, because you
belong to the Government of God.

156
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:35,323
And this Government is extremely alert, very
genuine and also extremely efficient.

157
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:43,216
And as far as you are concerned, you are a
citizen of that Great Kingdom.

158
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:49,984
So what you have achieved is the citizenship
of this great Kingdom of God where you should

159
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,135
feel absolutely secured.

160
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:59,582
The man who is secure is never afraid, never
afraid.

161
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:04,676
So you have also got rid of your fear.

162
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:11,404
Man is in the - I don't know why he's afraid
of this and afraid of that, and worries about

163
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,666
this and worries about that.

164
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:22,136
It's something surprising how they worry about
their health, worry about their family, their

165
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:27,506
children, their house, I mean all sorts of
things.

166
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:31,221
But Sahaja Yogis don't, they don't.

167
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:33,735
We have no worry.

168
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,483
It all works out.

169
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:37,142
Why should we worry?

170
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:40,157
That instrument of worry is over.

171
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:43,921
It's finished; I think it's gone out of order.

172
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:53,266
And what you are now in a state where you
just have no time to worry, because you are

173
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,614
enjoying yourself.

174
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:06,800
This fear I have seen in people works so much
that so many diseases people get out of fear,

175
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:12,930
so many diseases, specially most of these
left sided diseases people get out of fear.

176
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,954
What is there to fear?

177
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:21,084
This is like you beat the Mother Earth saying
that there's a snake.

178
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:26,585
There's no snake, but you may just feel that
way and you may go on with this fear.

179
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:37,610
Anybody, any kind of a idea about a phantom
or someone or some sort of a big devil standing

180
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:41,225
somewhere; it is all nonsense.

181
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,795
For you, it doesn't exist.

182
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:50,183
Say in the darkness you are walking so you
see forms and things and some people say I

183
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,640
saw one on a tree, one some sort of a form;
it doesn't exist actually, it doesn't exist.

184
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:00,808
But this fear in man makes him think like
that.

185
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:06,339
He's afraid of this and afraid of that, and
then as a result, he loses his freedom.

186
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:14,719
He becomes slave, slave to so many people
he's afraid of - that such and such man will

187
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:23,034
harm me, such and such man will trouble Me,
and the whole concept of fear has ruined our

188
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,698
family lives.

189
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:33,073
For example, a wife is dominating, husband
is dominating, there's nothing to fear, nothing

190
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:33,772
to fear.

191
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:37,528
By fear only you play into their hands.

192
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:41,663
So supposing the wife is dominating, just
make fun out of it.

193
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:48,063
If you cannot make the fun in the presence
of say your wife or your husband, better make

194
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:49,013
it outside.

195
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:50,985
Take it, "Oh look at that."

196
00:30:51,614 --> 00:31:01,385
It is your special quality now that you can
really get rid of your fear completely.

197
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,840
What is there to be afraid of wife or afraid
of husband?

198
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,861
What can he do to you?

199
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:11,706
At the most he'll kill you, so what, you are
going to die in anyway.

200
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:18,933
So the fear of death is another nonsense people
have.

201
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:26,078
First time when I started My work everywhere
they asked Me, "What about death?"

202
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:30,333
I said, but just now you are living; why are
you asking, "What about death?"

203
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:33,787
So many people ask Me question, "What about
our death";

204
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:35,633
 with why do you want to know about it?

205
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:38,544
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

206
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:46,719
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

207
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,283
and whatever happens.

208
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,107
Once you are dead you are finished.

209
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:52,207
You don't have to do anything after that.

210
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:58,017
So what's the use of knowing when, when you
will die, what will happen to you?

211
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,192
Whatever has to happen will happen.

212
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:03,557
We never ask, that when I sleep what will
happen to me, do we?

213
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:09,202
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

214
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,332
will happen after death.

215
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:17,205
One has to die at the time whenever it has
to die, because whatever is born has to be

216
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,376
dead.

217
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:27,020
But you do know that you have got eternal
life.

218
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,585
You can never die.

219
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:42,158
Death is not this body disappearing; death
is where you are absolutely without any control

220
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:44,181
of your soul live.

221
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:54,572
Once you are a realized soul you have all
the control, all the powers: to take your

222
00:32:54,597 --> 00:33:00,237
soul wherever you feel like, to be born if
you like; if you don't want you will not be

223
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:08,872
born, to be born with the people in the families,
in the communities wherever you like.

224
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:15,597
There are many great souls I know that have
taken birth daringly into societies which

225
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:23,512
are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed because

226
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,993
of stupidity they do.

227
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:40,893
So this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

228
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,633
What is there to think even about your death?

229
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,280
There is nothing like death for you because
you have got eternal life.

230
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:56,415
It's not that you continue with the same body.

231
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,725
You may go on changing your dress but you
are living, you are aware, and you know even

232
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:10,037
if this body is not there-you will be there;
all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga, for

233
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:15,612
anything that is to be done in the name of
reality.

234
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:29,098
So you must know your position as eternal
being what is your work, what is your idea,

235
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,790
what you have to do.

236
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:39,846
So one has to get rid of this idea of death
because death doesn't exist for you.

237
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:41,141
It's finished.

238
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:49,252
Moreover, all such people who are afraid of
their death go on having insurances, this,

239
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:54,831
that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what
happens?

240
00:34:55,363 --> 00:35:00,278
All these worldly things you leave here and
you depart.

241
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:11,255
There is I don't think anybody could carry
even a little dust with that soul

242
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,858
which is departing.

243
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:22,388
But in your case, when you people are no more
on this earth so called, then you don't carry

244
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,880
all this material things because you have
already given up.

245
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,925
You have no interest in them.

246
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:37,177
You're not materialistic so your spirit is
free, and when you die what happens to you

247
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:43,482
is a very simple thing - that you feel very
liberated, absolutely.

248
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:52,561
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

249
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:59,438
It's all under your own guidance, your own
desire; everything works out.

250
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:06,993
You don't feel that you have come out of your
body, and this is what should tell you that

251
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:14,886
there should be no fear of death, but on the
contrary - it should be welcomed.

252
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:22,841
Because you will feel much more liberated,
much more at ease.

253
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:28,932
You don't have other problems that you have
to in any case carry on in this world so because

254
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:30,087
of this body.

255
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:36,307
Now see I have to take some medicines, I have
to take vitamins; don't have to take anything,

256
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:37,871
don't need it.

257
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:41,276
This body's finished is a very good idea.

258
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:47,146
They're so troublesome it is you see.

259
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,859
All the time despite the fact that you may
say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

260
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:54,283
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

261
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:59,188
This is the most sticky thing we have is our
body.

262
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:10,843
So to forget about death should be the easiest
thing for you.

263
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:14,743
We have broken many walls.

264
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:26,002
As you know very well that the conditionings
we had, we have finished that.

265
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:27,659
It's very surprising.

266
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,715
I've seen people when they get their realization,
immediately after that

267
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,458
they start seeing around them.

268
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:41,352
They'll immediately tell you what's wrong
with their religion, then they'll tell you

269
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:46,360
what's wrong with their country; what's wrong
with their culture.

270
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:49,455
It's through them I have come to know so much.

271
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:52,905
I didn't know that this was so, but they themselves
told us.

272
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:59,415
Now for example there's a French man, take
it - if a Frenchman gets realization, I mean

273
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:02,765
you know everything about French.

274
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:07,505
The things you could never even imagine what
sort of people they are; they will tell you

275
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:08,505
everything.

276
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:11,105
Same with the English I've seen.

277
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:18,215
English they may, they laugh at themselves
all right, but actually when they become realized

278
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:24,465
souls you see, they give you a complete picture
of English people: what sort of people are

279
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:28,325
there, what's wrong with them, how they are
egoistical, this, that.

280
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,325
I was amazed.

281
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:34,495
I mean, I, I, I never knew so many things
which I came to know through Sahaja Yogis

282
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,285
who got realization.

283
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:41,535
Because they have seen all these things very
thoroughly and very closely and they knew

284
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:45,159
what was it.

285
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:56,243
Now when you become so cleaned, washed out
completely, mind completely cleaned out from

286
00:38:56,268 --> 00:39:06,195
all kinds of conditionings you see; you become
like a mirror, beautiful mirror.

287
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:13,325
And in that mirror one can see complete picture
of the society in which you live, the complete

288
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:18,583
picture of the government which rules you;
everything, so clear-cut.

289
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:20,499
And it is absolute.

290
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:22,484
It is not biased.

291
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:27,307
For example you ask somebody, then he will
say, "What is your politics?"

292
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:32,853
If I say My politics is I have no politics,
say, "What you have no politics, how can we

293
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:34,528
exist without politics?"

294
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:36,173
I have no politics.

295
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:45,040
So they will go on asking questions to you
which are very much unknown.

296
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:49,688
But for a realized soul, it's just the other
way round.

297
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:58,153
Hes not only sees, but also shows and expresses,
very clearly.

298
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:08,718
I've been amazed at the way people have been
really so reflective of the society into which

299
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:13,213
they live and the country which they represent.

300
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:18,275
So the identification is lost, complete identification
is lost.

301
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,294
You don't feel identified much.

302
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,568
You just see what's wrong with that world.

303
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:30,821
Then also another point is that you start
seeing how you can help, what you should do,

304
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,271
how you can work it out.

305
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:39,331
And the importance of that becomes your main
thing in life.

306
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:44,991
Everybody I see, yesterday the way you brought
all this flags and all that, behind that flag,

307
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:51,111
I could see, all of you wanted that peace
should prevail in those countries, they should

308
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:55,221
get all the joy and beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

309
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:57,281
It's what a feeling it is.

310
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:02,741
It's not like yourself becoming Sahaja Yogis
and sitting in the corner, no.

311
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:10,991
They want to do it for that country about
which they are not identified, but without

312
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:17,981
identification, they have that deep feeling
that they have to work out; correct it.

313
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:22,581
It's a very different type of personality
you develop.

314
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:28,801
Normally you see if you say a word against
somebody that, "See in your country they do

315
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:29,801
like this.."

316
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,411
"Oh what you're talking, what about your country?"

317
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:33,411
Immediately.

318
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:35,291
They'll never accept.

319
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:45,483
If you just try to even say one word against
them, their country or their government, which

320
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:49,138
may be the most rotten government, but no
still, "What?

321
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:51,848
We are all right."

322
00:41:51,848 --> 00:42:01,394
That kind of stupid identification, which
keeps you completely glued to that society;

323
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:05,339
like some people will say, "No, no, I have
to go to the pub."

324
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,029
I say, why?

325
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,272
Why you have to go to the pub?

326
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:10,753
"That's our society; that's our culture.

327
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:11,899
We have to go.

328
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:18,687
We have to go to the pub, get drunk and fall
down, all of us together.

329
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:21,919
That's the sort of thing we are; we can't
help it you see.

330
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:23,190
This is what it is."

331
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:26,795
You tell anybody that, why do you do this
like this?

332
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,175
What is the need to do?

333
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,694
"Now, because I have to live in this society,
after all, after all I belong to this society

334
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,828
and I just can't do what I like."

335
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:41,920
But when you get your realization, you can
do what you like.

336
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,290
You can do what you like, because you only
like that is righteous, that is good, that

337
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,640
is constructive, that is helpful.

338
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,300
So you can do whatever you like; after realization,
there's no restriction for you.

339
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,150
All these restriction of, "don't, don't, don't,
don't" - these clearly enslave you.

340
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,110
I think it very much enslaves you.

341
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:11,090
But in after realization, you are such a free
bird that nothing can enslave you.

342
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,140
For example, there are many preachers who
preach - you shouldn't drink, you should not

343
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:21,854
smoke, this, shouldn't take drugs, you should
do this, you should do that -

344
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:24,236
but it doesn't stop.

345
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:25,711
It doesn't help.

346
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:31,649
People struggle, try everything, ultimately
they commit suicides, but they can't get rid

347
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:37,570
of those habits; while now you are so powerful
that nothing can stick to you.

348
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:44,180
That's the purity of your character that has
come up; it doesn't allow any nonsensical

349
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,170
things to stick to you.

350
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:53,520
I've heard of so many Sahaja Yogis telling
me, how their eyes have steadied down, how

351
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,710
they have become so righteous, how they have
become so pure and they can't understand.

352
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,840
They said, "Mother is it Your power, Your
purity You have given us, or it is our purity

353
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
You have awakened?"

354
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Of course yours.

355
00:44:06,868 --> 00:44:08,394
No doubt.

356
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:17,381
All these things you have, and you become
aware of it, and thus you get absolutely misidentified

357
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:22,801
I should say with all these nonsensical things,
and you don't like it.

358
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,161
You just don't like it.

359
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,562
And you go on criticizing.

360
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:35,462
I've been to all these countries also before,
and I have met people who are very much identified,

361
00:44:35,462 --> 00:44:41,742
and diplomatically I was not suppose to say
anything whatsoever that would make them feel

362
00:44:41,742 --> 00:44:44,562
that they are doing something wrong.

363
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:50,962
But after Sahaja Yoga, the same people are
telling us and making fun of the whole thing.

364
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:53,431
For example, I've heard some Sahaja Yogis
talking to each other.

365
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:59,192
He says, "You see my country, this is so stupid
thing going on."

366
00:44:59,192 --> 00:45:04,412
Another one said, "Nobody can beat mine; it's
much worse."

367
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:16,121
Is a very common competition among Sahaja
Yogis going on.

368
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:33,571
So that we have to see how pure we have become,
and in this purity anything that is dirty,

369
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:41,762
murky, anything that will spoil this purity;
we don't like it.

370
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:44,202
We don't like it.

371
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:50,762
We are washed, cleaned, from inside, and won't
want to take anything like that

372
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:52,739
within us anymore.

373
00:45:54,453 --> 00:46:01,952
Then I've seen also, the way people have become
so compassionate.

374
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:08,272
Is very surprising how they have become compassionate
to each other.

375
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:16,722
For example, there were two Sahaja Yogis,
they were not very happy with each other,

376
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:19,621
not compatible; whatever you say that is.

377
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:25,742
And I didn't know how to make them feel that,
"You see the other Sahaja Yogi's all right;

378
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:27,772
doesn't matter after all, what is."

379
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:29,922
"No I don't like this thing in him."

380
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:33,947
And the another one would say, "I don't like
this thing about him."

381
00:46:33,972 --> 00:46:38,017
So it went on: "I don't like," he says, "I
don't like."

382
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:45,202
I mean they were seeing each other's defects
or whatever you may call them.

383
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:49,328
So I said, "All right now will you meditate
for some time?"

384
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:52,826
Again, "Meditate, meditate."

385
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:57,115
And I said, "Now, do you love me?"

386
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,719
She said I, one says, "I love You more than
he loves."

387
00:47:03,162 --> 00:47:08,222
I said, "Is difficult situation."

388
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:19,960
How to make them understand now that you cannot
weigh your love; you cannot make a

389
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:21,655
chart out of it.

390
00:47:21,684 --> 00:47:29,942
It is something within yourself, and if you
love somebody then you enjoy it.

391
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:33,578
I mean you cannot qualify it; you cannot quantify
it.

392
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:42,013
But this was going on with these two gentlemen
together, and I thought, "Now what to do?"

393
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:48,286
They are very important, and still there's
no understanding between the two.

394
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:52,821
So the Divine Power took over I think.

395
00:47:52,846 --> 00:47:57,459
One of them fell very sick suddenly, very
sick.

396
00:47:57,484 --> 00:48:03,734
And I had sent word also that, "You'll be
sick; be careful."

397
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:12,144
But it was I mean they thought that the other
fellow might be trying to be funny or something;

398
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:13,902
it was not understood.

399
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:14,902
He was very sick.

400
00:48:14,902 --> 00:48:25,750
When he fell sick, then this one, the another
one, felt such tremendous love for him.

401
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:35,010
It's something, nobody can explain, that he
went and sat with that patient for 24 hours,

402
00:48:36,402 --> 00:48:41,602
and said that, "If you need any money, I have
got."

403
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:47,391
He paid for wherever he could pay.

404
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:56,802
So this gentleman also was very sensible,
reasonable person on his own - felt this love,

405
00:48:56,802 --> 00:49:02,644
this affection, in this hard taskmaster, the
other one - and such understanding

406
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:04,614
 grew up within them.

407
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:15,211
It is I think, is the Divine's Play that they
were brought together, so close and such compassion.

408
00:49:15,236 --> 00:49:22,767
So the force of compassion within you is so
much, it's very subtle; you don't see.

409
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:31,332
Because on mental level - I was telling them,
arguing, trying to pacify him, pacify him;

410
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:34,688
like that was on - it would not work out.

411
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:46,967
But when this force of compassion started
acting suddenly into one of them, the another

412
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:58,967
one saw the compassion, the pure compassion,
and just they became great friends.

413
00:49:58,992 --> 00:50:04,982
So one has to feel the compassion within yourself.

414
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:15,677
I've seen many a times that there are many
Sahaja Yogis and sometimes I have to correct

415
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:17,112
them, or say something.

416
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:23,861
Immediately, another one will say, "Mother
can You forgive him, You can't forgive?"

417
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:24,968
I say I have forgiven.

418
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:26,902
I am not doing anything.

419
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:29,391
"Please forgive, please."

420
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:42,881
I feel so happy to hear that, that in one
point, in one condition, when it comes to

421
00:50:42,881 --> 00:50:48,656
Sahaja Yogi, you support him, even against
Me; I feel happy.

422
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:57,291
Shows that you are not only generous, but
you are filled with your compassion.

423
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:06,871
So this source of compassion which is within
your being, in your heart, you have to just

424
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:08,341
open your heart.

425
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:13,722
If you open that heart, it's like opening
the Sahasrara.

426
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:20,763
You'll be amazed how you can forgive people
and you can live with them.

427
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:27,531
I've reports which disturbs Me many a times
that people are forming different groups,

428
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:33,493
and having different ashrams, and they don't
come to the collective, and all that.

429
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:35,605
I feel very much concerned.

430
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:41,967
Now what is missing is, of course, there are
also some people who think that they must

431
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:44,956
have a separate, their own organization, and

432
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:47,504
why should they be in the collective, and all that.

433
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:59,575
So that it is definite, that such a person
has not yet achieved that state of compassion.

434
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:12,541
In the state of compassion, you like that
somebody tells you that, "Don't say anything

435
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:14,811
to such and such person.

436
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:16,912
I don't want you to say this."

437
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:20,262
It's very, very joy giving to Me.

438
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:25,021
Like we had one couple, they were quarrelling
throughout.

439
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:27,861
They used to send Me letters after letters.

440
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:34,742
Ah baba, was fed up; telephones after telephones,
both of them quarrelling.

441
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:41,851
Quarrelling so much, I didn't know what to
do with them.

442
00:52:41,851 --> 00:52:47,841
So, I thought that it's better that they divorce
and finish it off.

443
00:52:47,841 --> 00:53:00,192
And I told them, separately, that, "You better
divorce each other and get out of it, but

444
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:04,881
the complaints you have are such that they
cannot be solved."

445
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:05,881
Said, "How?"

446
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:14,702
I said, "You are saying that my husband doesn't
give me more time, he is always out, and he

447
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:19,497
doesn't spend any nice moments with me, we
don't go out

448
00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:21,683
 and all these complaints are there.

449
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:26,861
And the husband says that, she always troubles
me that I must take her out, and I must do

450
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:28,871
this, and I must do that.

451
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,742
I want to do it but I can't do it."

452
00:53:30,742 --> 00:53:35,112
So I said, "But when you take a divorce, you'll
never, can claim anything.

453
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:38,412
Permanently, the husband is lost and you are
lost.

454
00:53:38,412 --> 00:53:40,601
So why do you want to do such a thing?"

455
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:49,551
Immediately, know this compassion started
working, and then I put in a word, "Supposing

456
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:56,042
any one of you is sick tomorrow, then who
will look after each other?"

457
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:58,443
This just put them out.

458
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:06,402
You know such little, little moments in life,
come in, in the life of Sahaja Yogis I've

459
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:15,922
seen, that suddenly this heart opens, and
with that - they combat all these petty, nonsensical,

460
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:21,727
ideas which keeps them out; out of each other
and out of the collectivity.

461
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:29,722
What gives me the greatest enjoyment is to
see how you love each other, care for each

462
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:33,987
other, joke with each other and dance with
each other.

463
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:37,361
This is the greatest thing that I enjoy.

464
00:54:37,386 --> 00:54:41,541
I don't want to get rid of this idea of Mine.

465
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:48,641
Despite the fact, so many times I find it's
hard to believe how could Sahaja Yogis behave

466
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:59,695
like this, and try to create rifts, and distances
between the people who are realized souls.

467
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:07,360
Because realized souls anywhere in the world,
you should see them, they respect each other.

468
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:14,139
Not only respect, cared and never talked ill
of another realized soul.

469
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:15,164
Never.

470
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:20,564
I don't know if you have known about the private
lives of these saints.

471
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:27,871
But in India as we have had so many of them,
when you see them - how they have behaved

472
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:37,861
towards each other, the way they have looked
after each other - it's so beautiful; it's

473
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:39,081
so noble.

474
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:47,502
As if they care for the other Sahaja Yogi,
or yogi, or a realized soul, than for themselves.

475
00:55:47,502 --> 00:56:01,222
And the whole thing makes you feel like in
a new world, of new people, who care for the

476
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:07,540
feelings of others, and not - what they want
to say, or what they want to have, or they

477
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:10,155
are something special.

478
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:18,311
Also in Sahaja Yoga, you have come; you have
lost your specialities.

479
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:23,110
Some of them think they're very special.

480
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:33,742
Supposing I call some lady to put say alta
on My Feet, she starts thinking she is very

481
00:56:33,742 --> 00:56:38,316
special, but I just call her because I know
she has a horrible agnya and

482
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:40,348
I have to clear it out.

483
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:50,205
And when somebody told Me, "Mother she thinks
something very special," I said, "Really,

484
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,766
what makes her think like that?"

485
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:56,141
"Because You call her to put some alta on
Your Feet."

486
00:56:56,141 --> 00:57:02,916
I said I just called her that she has such
a horrid, ugly, agnya that she will trouble

487
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:07,241
everyone, so I want to clear it.

488
00:57:08,017 --> 00:57:16,904
So, either I should have told her that you
are a very egoistical, horrible and all the

489
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:21,810
words that are possible, otherwise she won't
understand.

490
00:57:21,835 --> 00:57:23,635
It's so surprising.

491
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:32,551
There is one lady who was really very nasty
to her in-laws and everybody in India, and

492
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:33,851
she came to see Me.

493
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,582
I called her.

494
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:37,781
I actually scolded her.

495
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:41,081
I said, "What business you had to behave like
this here?

496
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:45,692
Your father who was such a racist, you never
said a word against him, and why are you talking

497
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,581
so much against these people?"

498
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:48,722
I scolded her.

499
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:53,978
She went out and told, "Oh look at Mother
has called me; nobody is allowed to see Her."

500
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,846
I said, "What's this?"

501
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:05,301
It's a very funny situation with people I
sometimes feel the way they think they're

502
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:08,172
something special, and they should make themselves
special.

503
00:58:08,172 --> 00:58:11,422
It is becoming really difficult.

504
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:24,242
Now just to show My love, to appreciate something
people have done, and if you give some present

505
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:31,831
to that person, or you show concern about
that person, because he's done some good work

506
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:36,771
or something, he starts thinking he's something
special.

507
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:46,022
I mean is an impossible situation, because
I expect that if I have done anything good

508
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:54,871
to that person, or in any way suggested My
concern about a person - that person has to

509
00:58:54,871 --> 00:59:04,222
become a very good Sahaja Yogi; in the sense
the most humble, and honest, and loving person.

510
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:07,871
Otherwise it has no meaning.

511
00:59:07,871 --> 00:59:15,752
No use being good to anyone if that means
that person jumps into hell.

512
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:33,351
So this one is also another idea of speciality,
that they have lost their sense of speciality.

513
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:43,041
When a drop becomes the ocean, it has become
the ocean, but it's not the drop anymore.

514
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:49,432
If anybody thinks, "I am a special person,"
then know that you are no more an ocean; you

515
00:59:49,432 --> 00:59:51,391
are still the drop.

516
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:58,408
Because unless and until you are the drop,
how can you feel that "I am something special"?

517
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:02,903
So you have lost your speciality.

518
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:11,673
You have lost it, because all these ideas
of speciality comes from your past.

519
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:21,393
One lady I met once, long time back, she was
a very rude, proud, arrogant woman.

520
01:00:21,393 --> 01:00:27,062
So this was in Delhi, where people are very
conscious of their husband's jobs, and this

521
01:00:27,062 --> 01:00:29,423
and that.

522
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:37,164
I didn't even know the destination, or even
the designation of My husband.

523
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:41,723
So she was very rude to Me.

524
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:46,720
I said what's the matter with you, why are
you so rude, what's the problem?

525
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,310
She said, "You don't know?

526
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:51,795
I'm the wife of such and such."

527
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:56,618
You're the wife or the husband?

528
01:00:56,643 --> 01:01:01,230
"I'm the wife of such and such."

529
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,650
So she asked Me, "What are you doing here?"

530
01:01:05,675 --> 01:01:07,869
I said, "I am a housewife."

531
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:15,276
Then My husband came.

532
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:17,077
She said, "Do you know him?"

533
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:19,589
I said, "Yes I know, why?"

534
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:26,833
I thought there must be something wrong there
also.

535
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:33,338
So she said, "No I just want to know.

536
01:01:33,363 --> 01:01:36,952
How do you know him?"

537
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:40,527
As if I was some criminal or what?

538
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:42,623
I said, "He's My husband."

539
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,978
"Oh my God, he's your husband?"

540
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:47,484
What happened?

541
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:52,525
As if ten serpents had bitten her.

542
01:01:53,709 --> 01:02:00,919
Maybe, maybe her husband was at a much lower
position than my husband, maybe something

543
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:03,289
which I am not conscious of it.

544
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:11,314
But this is what is "I'm something special."

545
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:20,160
This stupid idea of being special has to be
completely negated in Sahaja Yoga.

546
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,423
Not mentally.

547
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:22,535
Not mentally.

548
01:02:22,845 --> 01:02:33,734
Mentally if you're again saying, "I'm not
special, I'm not special," like a mantra,

549
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:38,931
you'll become much more.

550
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:45,802
Because you'll say, "I've said this mantra
23,000 times.

551
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:51,986
Who can say like me?"

552
01:02:54,664 --> 01:03:00,942
So this idea - I'm something special, I'm
something great, I'm something out of the

553
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:08,986
blue, something superior to others - just
vanishes.

554
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:15,072
Like as I said, you are a drop in the sea.

555
01:03:15,097 --> 01:03:23,860
You have become the ocean, but you are no
more a drop, to have any relative value system.

556
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,409
There's no relative value system.

557
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:34,479
There is no system by which you can say that
I'm higher or he's lower; all that has created

558
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:37,640
all the problems of the world.

559
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:45,496
See from our caste system in India, the social
systems in the West, the racialism in the

560
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:56,239
West, also self consciousness of "my religion
is better, yours is worst, we are the best"

561
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:59,539
- all these things have created problems.

562
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:02,070
It has done no good.

563
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,879
It has failed and failed and failed.

564
01:04:04,904 --> 01:04:12,452
So in Sahaja Yoga at least don't bring this
disease anymore - that, "I'm better, we, our

565
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:14,112
country's better..."

566
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:24,449
This speciality you should drop, and real
beauty of your personality will show.

567
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:31,229
For that you don't need a special scale, you
don't need a special body, you don't need

568
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:36,769
a special, what you can call, a glamorous
look.

569
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:39,333
What you need is a beautiful heart.

570
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:46,275
And I tell you, it's the beautiful heart that
attracts; nothing else.

571
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:49,566
It's the beautiful heart that you want to
have.

572
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:55,441
I've known people nay many like that.

573
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:58,906
There was one gentleman who divorced his first
wife.

574
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:03,616
She maybe not be so good looking, maybe ugly,
or whatever it was.

575
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:10,880
Then he married another good-looking woman,
and he ran away from the house.

576
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:12,504
So I asked him why.

577
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:17,873
You didn't like that woman because she was
ugly or whatever it was, so why have you now

578
01:05:17,898 --> 01:05:19,609
running away from this one?

579
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:21,323
"She has no heart.

580
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,502
She has no heart."

581
01:05:27,527 --> 01:05:36,655
And this is what you have - a very great,
generous, beautiful, dharmic heart.

582
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:45,810
You have got it as a present from the Divine,
and which you must respect.

583
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:56,917
Should be proud of it, and enjoy it, as you
should enjoy your generosity.

584
01:05:56,942 --> 01:06:03,021
You should enjoy the way all this nature is
enjoying itself.

585
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:11,228
To be very meticulous about things, to be
all the time correcting others, is a headache.

586
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:13,970
It's a headache.

587
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:19,448
The best thing is to correct yourself, and
laugh at yourself; that's the best way you

588
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:20,473
can do it.

589
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:25,237
Everybody has some funny things about themselves.

590
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:29,125
I also have; I must confess.

591
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:34,999
And I enjoy them because I think I try and
try, but always I forget.

592
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:38,715
For example spectacles, I always forget them.

593
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,227
Before coming see I must always forget it.

594
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:48,914
I tell Myself that I need it, I should take
it, must remember; but invariably I forget,

595
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:52,289
and I don't know why.

596
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:56,804
I, I, I can't do without it, but still I forget.

597
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,581
There's so many things.

598
01:06:58,812 --> 01:07:01,891
For example, I don't know how to count money.

599
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:05,946
If you may give me 100 rupees, I'll count
it 200 rupees.

600
01:07:06,563 --> 01:07:10,831
I tell you I, I'm good at mathematics, but
I can't count.

601
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:13,538
I don't know how to sign a check; can you
believe it?

602
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:14,563
I can't sign.

603
01:07:14,703 --> 01:07:18,133
You have to write the check for Me, otherwise
I can't.

604
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:26,738
And somebody asks Me say for say 100 rupees;
I'll give him a big 500 and forget about it.

605
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:29,014
And that person says, "Mother You gave me
500."

606
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,876
No, no, no, I gave you 100 only.

607
01:07:30,901 --> 01:07:32,809
"No, You gave me 500."

608
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,400
I went home and found out.

609
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,251
It's all right.

610
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:40,261
After all, if he's dishonest - he's dishonest;
if he's honest - he's honest.

611
01:07:40,286 --> 01:07:46,066
So why to worry about how much money you gave,
and this thing, that thing, meticulously you

612
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:48,849
see, finding everything like this?

613
01:07:48,874 --> 01:07:53,059
And I've seen with all these meticulous people,
they always fail.

614
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,969
Because you see this brain plays some tricks
on them.

615
01:07:56,969 --> 01:08:00,757
For example, there was one fellow who told
Me that,

616
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:03,473
 "The size of your car is such and such."

617
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:04,498
All right then.

618
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,272
"So the size of the garage will be such and
such."

619
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:09,909
I said all right.

620
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:14,205
So, when we build the garage, the car won't
get in.

621
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:27,431
I said such a meticulous architect, and such
a well-known person who has got so many awards,

622
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:30,835
this, that - how could he make such a mistake?

623
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:33,471
But I still didn't understand it you see.

624
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:36,709
Now he said, "Now you better buy a smaller
car."

625
01:08:41,111 --> 01:08:47,694
I said at least now you measure this garage
in a proper way, otherwise again if I buy

626
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:50,006
something it won't enter in.

627
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:55,079
So you see what I'm saying, we are so particular,
so meticulous.

628
01:08:55,104 --> 01:08:59,855
Now see these little, little flowers I see
them here; they're not meticulous.

629
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:06,451
They are growing on their own freely, everybody
gets the sun's rays, and they're quite happy.

630
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:13,133
But the way we are particular, those people
are very particular, are headaches to themselves.

631
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:16,677
And then ultimately they find that it's not
so.

632
01:09:16,702 --> 01:09:19,593
You have lost that; you have lost that meticulousness.

633
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:25,719
I know of a Sahaj Yogini; she was running
a shop, and she said, "Mother I knew each

634
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:29,887
and everything, and I knew each and every
price, and everything I knew in this shop,

635
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:33,734
but since I've got realization; I've forgotten
everything."

636
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,959
So are you happy or unhappy?

637
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:38,353
"I'm very happy."

638
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:39,146
Why?

639
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:42,483
"Because now I'm making a big profit."

640
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:44,077
Profit is the main thing.

641
01:09:44,102 --> 01:09:46,992
Why should you try to remember each and every
thing?

642
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:56,039
So it is to be very meticulous, to be very
systematic, very, world is, if you see around

643
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:57,718
- no tree is systematic.

644
01:09:57,743 --> 01:10:00,803
It is unsystematically systematic.

645
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:07,097
Some leaves are this side, some are that side;
some branches are on that side.

646
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:14,519
There's no system, because then you become
a military, if you form a system.

647
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:16,931
So in Sahaja Yoga there is no system.

648
01:10:16,956 --> 01:10:19,065
We are beyond time.

649
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:24,567
We are beyond all kinds of systems; we have
no system.

650
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:29,933
All of our system is, "What is the unigion
within ourselves?"

651
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:36,763
Like these two hands, they have no system
built in nothing, but they move.

652
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:42,897
Especially Italy if you want, both the hands
move like that all the time in Italy.

653
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:48,049
And I don't know what it means, but they all
do the same thing.

654
01:10:48,579 --> 01:10:50,034
There's no system built in.

655
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:53,344
Nobody said them that do these gestures and
all that.

656
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:59,649
But they do it, and do it naturally, all of
them together - without any system.

657
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:07,275
So to build up mental systems is wrong and
against Sahaja Yoga.

658
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,229
Some people have written to Me, "Mother we
want to translate your transcriptions, do

659
01:11:12,254 --> 01:11:13,785
this, do that" and plans.

660
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:14,795
I said forget it.

661
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,322
Forget.

662
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:23,860
Because if you start planning you see, you
will definitely, definitely fall into the

663
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:27,175
trap of systems.

664
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:31,760
You'll have to follow systems; this system
is good, that system is good.

665
01:11:31,785 --> 01:11:33,008
Why not have this way?

666
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:38,941
And because I don't, I don't say that it's
wrong, because you have been used to systems.

667
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:47,572
Especially in the West people have over systematic,
over systematic, in everything.

668
01:11:47,597 --> 01:11:54,357
Like they'll have courses you see built up,
then the spoons, then the forks, then the

669
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:59,059
how to move, and what to eat, and how to eat.

670
01:11:59,084 --> 01:12:00,529
I mean it is too much.

671
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:07,059
If you have to eat food, it's straightforward;
you can eat it with your hands.

672
01:12:07,985 --> 01:12:09,519
No system needed.

673
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:16,287
For all these systems and norms are too much
in the West, and you should really try to

674
01:12:16,312 --> 01:12:17,341
them curb down.

675
01:12:18,385 --> 01:12:25,181
As a result they had anti-culture and all
that nonsense; another kind of stupidity where

676
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:28,714
they were building up another kind of a system.

677
01:12:28,901 --> 01:12:31,676
See then they said, "We are hippies now."

678
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:32,463
All right.

679
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:38,893
So they must have hair never washed, never
clean with lice in their heads, and must be

680
01:12:38,918 --> 01:12:44,654
all like, you can say, the shankara style
you see.

681
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,282
So all of them have to have that.

682
01:12:48,307 --> 01:12:49,430
Again system.

683
01:12:51,002 --> 01:12:54,703
There's no variety; one hippie means another
the same.

684
01:12:54,728 --> 01:12:57,309
You cannot make them out one from another.

685
01:12:57,309 --> 01:13:00,688
If somebody puts say a ring here - everybody
will put.

686
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:07,478
If he puts a ring here - everybody will put;
without any brains, without any understanding.

687
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:13,000
And they talk of individuality; of personality
-where is the individuality?

688
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:21,663
There's no individuality, because you take
to anything that your gang, you can call,

689
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:28,269
or you can call the crowds that take it, very
fashionable.

690
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:36,999
In India if you say if it is very fashionable,
it means it is very expensive, and very beautiful

691
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:43,999
and is, I mean is very elite, elite word.

692
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:48,279
But when I said, "This is very fashionable,"
means everybody likes it.

693
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:52,728
It could be punky thing or anything, it's
fashionable.

694
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:53,753
Finished.

695
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:55,033
It's the fashion.

696
01:13:55,058 --> 01:14:03,177
Means you do not have your own idea, your
own personality, your own individuality.

697
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:11,764
In Sahaja Yoga, you too are not bound to any
fashion, no fashion.

698
01:14:11,789 --> 01:14:15,146
If like; wear this, wear that, whatever you
like.

699
01:14:15,171 --> 01:14:22,437
If you fit do what you like, you can wear
whatever you like, but you, as I said again

700
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:27,080
that you will govern yourself, you'll be your
own guru, you'll be your own master, and you'll

701
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:36,156
do whatever is good, whatever is decent, whatever
the Deities will like, will just do it that

702
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:40,122
way because now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

703
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:44,329
So the life becomes so much easier, so much
easier.

704
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:50,405
You don't worry about things which are not
there, and you are not also worried about

705
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:52,384
the things which are there.

706
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:58,931
Because you think now, you see something,
all right I have got these knives now; I must

707
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:02,389
keep this one for somebody.

708
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,224
I must give it to someone.

709
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,199
So I got a ring which was quite big.

710
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:11,670
Was thinking whom should I give this; who
has got thick fingers?

711
01:15:11,695 --> 01:15:17,346
So I started looking at the fingers of everyone
you see, whosoever has a thick finger I'll

712
01:15:17,371 --> 01:15:18,768
give him this one.

713
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:21,608
I mean the thought was just the other way
around.

714
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:26,570
Supposing you are not a Sahaja Yogi then you'll
say, "Oh Ma, such a big thick finger, why

715
01:15:26,595 --> 01:15:29,267
not take out some gold and use it, sell it
off?"

716
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:36,050
Or else you see, "You can take out the stone
from here."

717
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:41,216
I mean all kinds of nonsensical things you'll
think, but you'll not think that you better

718
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:44,506
give it to somebody because you can't wear
it; it's too big for you.

719
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:46,706
Why not give it to other?

720
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:47,997
What's wrong?

721
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:52,512
After all, it is not fitting you, so give
it to other.

722
01:15:52,624 --> 01:15:55,175
But this is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

723
01:15:55,275 --> 01:16:06,675
I've seen people, very kind, very, very kind
people who have been very sweet to each other

724
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:12,981
and exactly what the other person wants, they'll
buy and give it to that person.

725
01:16:13,142 --> 01:16:17,154
Or may say, oh no I have one, I'll give it
to you.

726
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:19,495
They do it like that.

727
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:23,318
It's all the time thinking about others.

728
01:16:23,722 --> 01:16:25,456
What should I give?

729
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:27,050
What should I do?

730
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:32,456
It's the expression of that joy, the compassion
within you.

731
01:16:32,596 --> 01:16:38,778
You use your matter for that, all the time,
all the time.

732
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:42,943
Like somebody's house was burgled in Canada.

733
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:48,287
So she writes to Me, "Thank God my house is
cleaned out now, I didn't know what to do

734
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,465
with it - the junk".

735
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:56,003
So you see this kind of an attitude comes
in that if you have to do, give to someone,

736
01:16:56,028 --> 01:17:02,980
then give it to someone who is a Sahaja Yogi
to express your love.

737
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:08,853
But normally people will do whatever is the
junk in the house, you see whatever is rotten,

738
01:17:08,878 --> 01:17:11,425
finished, that they will give as a present.

739
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:17,079
But when you are a Sahaja Yogi you want to
give something really very special, because

740
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:25,714
the whole being has become so beautiful - just
like a flower I should say which wants to

741
01:17:25,977 --> 01:17:31,463
give fragrance to others; all the time the
fragrance of your compassion and love, affection

742
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:33,717
and security.

743
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:45,088
It's a new age, that what they say, but I
would say it's a new human beings that are

744
01:17:45,113 --> 01:17:46,722
before Me.

745
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:54,897
And all this newness has so many beautiful
facets that they really sparkle like diamonds,

746
01:17:54,922 --> 01:17:58,195
no doubt about it.

747
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:11,845
My only blessings to you is that you grow
in it and grow in it and become greater and

748
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:18,309
greater people; never thinking that you are
better than others; never thinking that you

749
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:19,985
are special than others.

750
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:24,031
This will definitely soothe you down completely.

751
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:27,100
Somebody might have hurt you somewhere, doesn't
matter.

752
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:29,914
Somebody must have scolded you, doesn't matter.

753
01:18:29,964 --> 01:18:37,384
What is your capacity is to - love another
person, and to be affectionate and kind.

754
01:18:38,387 --> 01:18:48,068
I'm really amazed how these 25 years have
passed with all kinds of stupid problems,

755
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:51,475
and nice things and - such a mixture.

756
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:58,020
And all those things have never disturbed
Me; I was never disturbed.

757
01:18:58,243 --> 01:19:04,532
I used to act sometimes that I am angry, or
sometimes I used to say things which I should

758
01:19:04,557 --> 01:19:09,443
not have normally said, because it was needed
to be said.

759
01:19:09,468 --> 01:19:22,132
But, on the whole, like sitting in a very
big ship you can say, we all are elevated

760
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:26,253
into the realm of Divine Love.

761
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:29,377
And this is what one has to enjoy.

762
01:19:29,402 --> 01:19:38,557
One person if he has that love and compassion,
and that pure love, then that person can emit

763
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:47,929
it to others, and the record of this compassion
is extremely beautiful; which cannot be described

764
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:48,932
in words.

765
01:19:48,957 --> 01:19:51,526
Like yesterday I couldn't speak.

766
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,656
In what words I could put My feelings?

767
01:19:55,681 --> 01:20:05,645
I thought there are no words yet created on
this earth to express My deep feeling that

768
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:12,673
how you people have taken Sahaja Yoga so well
and have understood it.

769
01:20:12,926 --> 01:20:13,926
May God bless you all.

770
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,798
Sahasrara Puja is a short one.

771
01:20:36,307 --> 01:20:45,329
We don't have a very long puja for Sahasrara,
because you know Sahasrara breaks in no time.

772
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:54,999
So it's not a very long puja, but it's very
deep, and again ultimately the last chakra

773
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:59,121
which is opened out is here, is the heart.

774
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:07,403
So in the Sahasrara Puja our hearts open out,
that's the main thing, and that is what one

775
01:21:07,428 --> 01:21:11,099
has to enjoy, opening of your heart.

776
01:21:11,702 --> 01:21:19,297
Don't worry about any Deities, about any rituals,
any this and that, but just open your heart.

777
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:25,062
We are not bound by anything; just open your
heart.
