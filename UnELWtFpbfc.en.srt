1
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,495
Please, be seated.

2
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,455
What a great place.

3
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,655
Really?

4
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:25,548
It’s very gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis

5
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:34,511
have come to celebrate the Sahasrara Day.

6
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:46,947
Without breaking the Sahasrara,

7
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:58,016
we could not have achieved the ascent en-masse.

8
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:13,159
But the Sahasrara, which is the brain,

9
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,320
has gone into too much complications in the West

10
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:30,261
and the nerves are very much twisted, one upon another.

11
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:47,174
To keep Sahasrara open should be very easy

12
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:57,323
if the Western brains could understand

13
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:05,018
and be aware

14
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,965
about your Mother.

15
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:28,660
When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrara,

16
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:38,279
the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrara open

17
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,124
has to be complete surrendering.

18
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:57,011
For that many ask Me, "How do we do?"

19
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,512
It's a very funny question.

20
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,693
It is irrelevant.

21
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:21,592
If your Sahasrara has been opened out by someone,

22
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:27,736
and luckily that is the Deity before you,

23
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:34,856
it should be the easiest thing to surrender,

24
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:44,625
but it is not.

25
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:50,878
It is difficult

26
00:07:51,079 --> 00:08:00,211
because the attention that has come up,

27
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:04,396
through the cells of the brain,

28
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:12,451
expressing itself through the cells of the brain,

29
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:17,768
is polluted,

30
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,062
it is impure, it is destructive.

31
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:33,735
It spoils the nerves

32
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:41,816
and when the nerves are spoilt, the light of the Spirit

33
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:47,872
does not shine on the nerves.

34
00:08:52,592 --> 00:09:05,258
And you feel the inability to surrender.

35
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:12,173
Normally it should be the easiest thing to do.

36
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:21,581
So we have to mentally approach ourselves.

37
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,813
We have to talk to ourselves

38
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:36,293
and say to ourselves

39
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,464
“What are you doing?”

40
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:47,833
What is surrendering?

41
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:52,708
It is enjoyment.

42
00:09:56,956 --> 00:10:00,789
It is just enjoyment.

43
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:06,055
“Then why I cannot surrender?

44
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:11,147
What is lacking in me?

45
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:16,194
Am I a very low level person?

46
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:24,261
Am I the one who was just saying I'm a seeker

47
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,813
but I'm not?

48
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:33,573
Am I a dishonest person that I cannot surrender?

49
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:39,748
If so, what am I proud of myself?

50
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:51,085
If that is the situation, then why am I

51
00:10:51,286 --> 00:11:00,393
so much enamoured by my ego?”

52
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,930
What do you have to surrender?

53
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:28,128
A drop has to dissolve into the ocean to become the ocean.

54
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:38,647
And a drop cannot be greater than the ocean - can it be?

55
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,477
So what is the surrendering?

56
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:47,564
Surrendering of our conditionings, of our ego

57
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:54,206
and the artificial barriers we have built around us.

58
00:11:54,407 --> 00:12:03,475
One can approach mentally. One can approach emotionally

59
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:09,482
and also physically we can approach ourselves.

60
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:17,552
We can approach ourselves through mantras,

61
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:21,595
through seeing ourselves,

62
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:26,235
through knowing ourselves.

63
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:35,578
But one should know this is

64
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:42,686
the greatest of greatest opportunity - for you -

65
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,554
not for the Divine.

66
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,425
If you are not available

67
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,981
Divine can find Its own ways

68
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:58,730
of fulfilling Its last culmination of expression.

69
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:14,912
Even to understand how immense the task is

70
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:20,294
you need a surrendering heart.

71
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:29,320
Only through mental approach, when you arrive,

72
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:32,271
you develop a petty ego

73
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:36,541
that you are doing a great work.

74
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:45,166
Like I telephoned

75
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,362
to America, saying that I'll be coming,

76
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:54,362
and there's a very big scientist in Los Angeles who is an Indian,

77
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:59,574
Maharashtrian fellow. He missed his Nobel Prize -

78
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:03,841
such a great scientist.

79
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,525
He telephoned to Me immediately,

80
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:10,915
saying : "Mother I'm coming to New York to receive You.

81
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,043
I'm taking leave for fifteen days.

82
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,865
When You are here, I want to be with You.

83
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,685
What else is to be done?

84
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:22,896
As it is

85
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,459
I'm doing Sahaja Yoga by-the-way

86
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,493
at my own convenience, wherever I get time,

87
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,878
that's what I'm doing isn't it?

88
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,769
But I would like to travel with you to Europe

89
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,053
to all the different places with you to spend some time.

90
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:45,449
Otherwise what am I doing here?"

91
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,094
But what I have heard that

92
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:58,427
people are arriving at different times for Sahasrara Day.

93
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:02,481
I was amazed. It's typical western mind.

94
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,963
By the way, Sahaja Yoga is done, mostly -

95
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,023
by-the-way.

96
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:10,299
 It should be convenient. It should be a weekend,

97
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,902
when, just, by-the-way, for a holiday, we can go to Vienna.

98
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:22,377
There of course, by-the-way, we'll have a puja

99
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:25,469
and, by-the-way, Mother will raise the Kundalini.

100
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,774
She will awaken our deities

101
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:35,469
and then by-the-way we'll be enjoying the blessings.

102
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:42,774
No sacrifice can be done for God.

103
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:48,537
No time, they have no time. Everything is by-the-way.

104
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,190
It's rather amazing.

105
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:57,754
For war, people gave up their lives.

106
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:03,468
For destruction they work so hard, day and night.

107
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,493
But for the construction of humanity,

108
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:12,357
for the ultimate goal of Divinity, in the West,

109
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:17,056
how many there are who really surrender?

110
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:24,614
If it suits, then we'll be there.

111
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,469
Sahaja.

112
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,594
“This is Sahaja style. We should do it Sahaja.”

113
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:37,897
I heard about this many a times, and there are still many

114
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:42,644
who take that kind of an attitude towards Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,507
It is sometimes surprising for Me.

116
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,615
If I go to a village

117
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:58,665
people take leave for fifteen days, one month.

118
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:01,866
In Rahuri people take leave for one month

119
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,304
to prepare for My coming.

120
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:11,047
One day leave for them is a very big thing.

121
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:19,339
They are the people who deserve.

122
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:26,247
It's not what you dress and what you eat and what you have.

123
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:32,099
It's what you can give

124
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,408
and give up.

125
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:43,349
The tags of mundane life are to be cut off,

126
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,189
we must understand.

127
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:56,122
It's a progress of people like slaves tied up to chains;

128
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:01,441
chains of desires,

129
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:05,849
chains of “complacentness”,

130
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,954
chains of lethargy,

131
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:16,668
chains of ego which is like a log.

132
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:32,478
So we have to understand ourselves.

133
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,438
Everybody has to understand oneself,

134
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,874
that through you the salvation of the world has to come.

135
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:47,856
You are chosen for the emancipation of the whole humanity.

136
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:54,057
The Divine wants you to work as a channel

137
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,677
for the beautification of this universe,

138
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:05,393
for the ultimate expression of God's love.

139
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,126
When I say this

140
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:15,822
I find suddenly the ego coming up automatically.

141
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:20,800
On the contrary, a surrender,

142
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:29,927
to fill up your vessels with the bliss,

143
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,047
the bliss of Divinity,

144
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,659
so that when you go to others

145
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,427
you pour on them the beauty and love of God.

146
00:19:45,240 --> 00:20:00,084
It is for you to understand yourself

147
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:04,408
very well and not others.

148
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:08,511
Don't blame anyone.

149
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:14,669
It's so precious

150
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,528
that no words can describe

151
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:27,271
the greatness of these moments which we are spending together.

152
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:38,204
You have to feel it within yourself

153
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:44,756
the assignment that is given to you.

154
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,781
Through your own Spirit,

155
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:51,440
through your own state

156
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:56,959
you can fulfill the assignment.

157
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:06,324
But lack of faith in yourself

158
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:11,091
cannot give you surrendering powers.

159
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:31,557
Surrender is the opening of Sahasrara,

160
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:40,444
keeping it completely open

161
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:46,949
so that the Nirvikalpa state is established within us.

162
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:56,381
There should be a regular progress of improvement,

163
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,381
regular progress of the opening.

164
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:06,819
Have you ever seen any lotus or any flower that blooms,

165
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,370
blooms, and in between again does not bloom,

166
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:17,274
then bloom then collapses then blooms.

167
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:24,302
Have you ever seen such a nonsensical phenomena in the nature?

168
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:31,972
You come up, again you go down, again you come up, you go down.

169
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,770
Have you ever seen a tree that comes up,

170
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,454

171
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:44,787
again it comes up, again goes back into the mud,

172
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,011
blaming other people?

173
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,475
Have you seen any animal which starts growing,

174
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:59,886
then it becomes a dwarf, again it grows, again it becomes a dwarf?

175
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:08,429
Even these huge palaces

176
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:14,073
which have been built so beautifully for us,

177
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:19,122
do you see that they become small,

178
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:24,768
suddenly, and then collapse and then again they blow up.

179
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,148
Only the balloon of ego and superego does that.

180
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,842
And when you are identified with them

181
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:45,668
you too become very peculiar personalities.

182
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:58,768
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

183
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:06,597
It must open more and more and more

184
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,508
and should not suddenly collapse,

185
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:13,548
again open, again collapse.

186
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,170
 It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

187
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,602
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

188
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:30,038
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

189
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,951
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

190
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:36,105
I'm very nervous about that."

191
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:37,742
Another person will come and tell Me,

192
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:43,130
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

193
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:49,088
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

194
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:00,674
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

195
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,222
within us,

196
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:07,633
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

197
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:10,913
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

198
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:14,184
What is this pendulum?

199
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,342
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

200
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:23,202
it is a lotus.

201
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,796
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

202
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,879
the attention that moves from left to right,

203
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,416
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

204
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:52,636
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

205
00:25:55,793 --> 00:26:01,703
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

206
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:06,029
then the heavens open within yourself.

207
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:18,861
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

208
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:22,674
creates that subtle opening, by which

209
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:26,796
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

210
00:26:26,997 --> 00:26:29,734
your brain.

211
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,680
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

212
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:39,249
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

213
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,772
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

214
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:47,856
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

215
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:51,924
the Divine doesn't bother.

216
00:26:57,072 --> 00:27:01,345
So it is you who has to achieve that state

217
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:07,014
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

218
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:14,275
In that there is just progression.

219
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:18,214
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

220
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:20,829
If somebody is still

221
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,759
going up and down, up and down,

222
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,155
he should know he is still not up to the point

223
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,946
and he should face up to himself

224
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:37,327
and tell himself or herself that

225
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:44,023
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

226
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:47,942
where I do not come down."

227
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:53,462
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

228
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:59,842
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

229
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:11,331
They are not going to be saved.

230
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,753
They will be punished.

231
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:21,519
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

232
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,368
but they will not occupy

233
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:31,061
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

234
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,565
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

235
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:44,212
Do not blame any circumstance.

236
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:50,392
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

237
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:54,607
There's no need to blame anyone.

238
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:00,542
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

239
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:02,875
What is the matter with you?

240
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,284
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

241
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:10,703
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

242
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,989
so dominating?

243
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,138
That means - what is your level?

244
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:28,259
So tomorrow I've decided to tell you

245
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,022
how to be at the state of Nirvikalpa.

246
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,579
As I said, we can approach mentally;

247
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,236
but mentally if I say you take this medicine

248
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:47,874
and you do not take the medicine, then it’s just a mental thing.

249
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:51,448
The medicine is kept on the cupboard, you are just the same.

250
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:55,961
And then you'll say, "Mother, yes we listened to your lecture."

251
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:02,645
So the key note

252
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:09,079
of tomorrow's puja, as I've decided,

253
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,670
that you have to be at the Nirvikalpa state.

254
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:33,918
You can say this Sahasrara Day is a very big day

255
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,518
because I never threw such an ultimatum before.

256
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:43,687
Because now we are established

257
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:48,107
as Vishwa Dharma,

258
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:52,222
as the Universal Religion.

259
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:57,941
We are not like other religions

260
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:04,303
where, after the death of the incarnations,
people started the religion

261
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:09,246
and did whatever they wanted to do with that.

262
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:17,832
In our living time

263
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:24,714
we are going to make ourselves that instrument

264
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:30,915
which will represent the Vishwa Dharma.

265
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:41,424
We have to have strong deities within ourselves.

266
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:48,153
We have weakened them by all mistakes, doesn't matter.

267
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:51,139
They are weak because traditionally

268
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,966
we haven't got the strength,

269
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,854
doesn't matter.

270
00:31:58,644 --> 00:32:02,253
But now this Religion has been established

271
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:11,266
we cannot have black spots

272
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,488
any more.

273
00:32:14,763 --> 00:32:23,046
We've done all the choosing, the training, everything

274
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:27,754
and you all have to jump into the boat now.

275
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:36,001
There's no more time left for us

276
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:43,647
to dilly-dally. Those who'll be left behind will be left behind.

277
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:43,647

278
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:53,785
It's a very intense period now, you must understand.

279
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:58,696
The intensity of the period is not by-the-way.

280
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:04,952
It's not any more Sahaja Yoga. It is Maha Yoga now.

281
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,690
And you have to become maha, you have to become great,

282
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:11,934
otherwise you cannot be there.

283
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:20,455
You have to jump out of all these things.

284
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:25,963
Tomorrow I'll try whatever is possible on My side.

285
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:30,116
I'll work it out. But it's a serious matter, I must tell you,

286
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:32,423
that once I've established the Religion,

287
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:36,952
I don't want to have any holes in it.

288
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,725
I avoided it because I was not sure.

289
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:56,453
Now I know for sure that there are many who could be called

290
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:59,107
as Nirmalites.

291
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:10,006
Because no more black spots

292
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:14,292
on the beautiful sari of your Mother.

293
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:27,511
It has to be absolutely

294
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,438
highest quality.

295
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,547
Gradually we used to drop out people,

296
00:34:38,748 --> 00:34:40,458
gradually worked out this

297
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,492
but there's no time left now.

298
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:48,544
As I have told you, I am going back to India.

299
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,994
Tomorrow I'll be able to tell you

300
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:06,054
how gradually you have got up to your Sahasrara.

301
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:13,573
And to get to Nirvikalpa,

302
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:21,125
you have to really dedicate yourself fully.

303
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:27,403
It's not a matter of convenience to come to Sahaja Yoga.

304
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:31,486
It's a Sahasrara Day,

305
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:36,687
you have to cross the Himalayas.

306
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:41,540
If you read the lives of the people who tried to

307
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,489
travel up to Kailasha,

308
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,084
you will know what hardships they have gone through.

309
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:51,645
I have taken you very sweetly, delicately, up to that point

310
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:55,251
but don't get spoilt by that.

311
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:58,821
You will all fizzle out into thin air

312
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:03,779
unless and until you are in the Nirvikalpa state.

313
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:13,186
I'm sorry I have to say that here in Austria.

314
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:20,865
This is the place which

315
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:28,332
should demarcate the end of our journey to left and right.

316
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:35,999
“Because my husband is like that, my wife is like that.

317
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,082
Because my child is like this.”

318
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,355
You are not going to be excused.

319
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:51,580
Whom are you telling? Your own Spirit?

320
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:55,101
Tell your Spirit, does it understand?

321
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:58,958
It takes away your vibrations,

322
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:06,721
it takes away your joy, it takes away your position.

323
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:17,138
Nirvichara is very easy to establish

324
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:20,173
but that, also, some people have not.

325
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:24,249
Then what about Nirvikalpa?

326
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:30,983
You have to take it up very seriously.

327
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,818
This may be the last Sahasrara Day

328
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:41,107
we are celebrating in Europe,
may be, I don't know.

329
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:54,009
It's not that Mother is only happy

330
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,971
if there are people of higher qualification

331
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:05,093
or higher caliber, it's not that.

332
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:14,662
I have very great concern for those who are lost,

333
00:38:14,863 --> 00:38:20,154
who are left out. But sometimes,

334
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:22,839
through My experience,

335
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:27,722
I think such people get spoilt.

336
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:39,202
My love is not for spoiling you,

337
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:43,511
is not for ruining you,

338
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,863
it is for your emancipation, it's for you to enjoy

339
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:58,120
the beauty of God's blessings on you.

340
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:04,651
Even now if there are people who are not righteous,

341
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:07,395
who are not truthful,

342
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:12,176
who are not virtuous at the dharma stage,

343
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:16,306
then what can I talk to them?

344
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:23,738
And then if they are not even the Spirit,

345
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:29,540
then what am I to do with them?

346
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,289
The ideologies, the talking,

347
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,835
the discussions and arguments do not lead you there.

348
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,285
No, they do not.

349
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:50,923
It's meditation.

350
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:55,901
What is meditation is actually facing yourself

351
00:39:56,102 --> 00:40:01,496
and correcting yourself with the full understanding as to what you are.

352
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:06,447
We have to create ideal human beings.

353
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,679
That is what is the Vishwa Dharma.

354
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,942
Otherwise we have many dharmas going on.

355
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,650
So many religious activities

356
00:40:14,851 --> 00:40:17,681
in the name of all the great incarnations

357
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,038
which are nowhere near the incarnations,

358
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,239
just the opposite of it.

359
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:29,882
This Nirvikalpa state has to be established,

360
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,647
once for all.

361
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:37,704
So I don't have to then struggle with you.

362
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:42,067
The group of people who will attend tomorrow, Sahasrara,

363
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:46,266
should be able to establish that state

364
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:50,508
otherwise they are just like the people who are newcomers.

365
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:54,046
They are coming for the first time, or ten times, or eleven times,

366
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:58,801
or hundred times, what difference does it make?

367
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:12,701
To Me it is clear cut.

368
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:18,519
I have short time,

369
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,016
because the instrument has to be all right.

370
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:33,233
If you have to expedite the growth

371
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,837
of the instrument in a proper way,

372
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:43,733
so that God's Love flows

373
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:51,106
and the God of that Love feels happy about it,

374
00:41:51,315 --> 00:42:00,997
we have to create such beautiful flowers that He appreciates,

375
00:42:01,198 --> 00:42:05,315
that He does not destroy.

376
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,596
The Spectator of this play has to be satisfied

377
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:16,640
so that He postpones His destruction.

378
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:28,476
That's why I said the time is short,

379
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:31,238
time is very short.

380
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:36,576
If we want our children to grow into the realm of God,

381
00:42:36,777 --> 00:42:39,463
they are great saints who are born,

382
00:42:39,664 --> 00:42:43,975
if we want to give them a full chance of the enjoyment,

383
00:42:44,176 --> 00:42:53,693
then let us first of all become proper parents

384
00:42:53,894 --> 00:43:00,729
and not people who just live with illusions.

385
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:09,915
Everything in Sahaja Yoga cannot be explained.

386
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:14,719
I cannot explain, I cannot, because

387
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,833
you don't have those powers to understand.

388
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:27,020
Like Gregoire said, "Mother I want to have the sun"

389
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,194
because people told him the weekend would be terrible,

390
00:43:30,395 --> 00:43:36,717
there won't be any sun. Within fifteen minutes the sun was shining,

391
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,941
within fifteen minutes. The wind started blowing,

392
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:45,208
all the clouds settled round Vienna beautifully,

393
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,640
like a Sahasrara,

394
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:50,088
and the sky opened,

395
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:55,635
as I want your Sahasrara to be open.

396
00:43:55,836 --> 00:44:02,020
All the nature is so anxious to work it out

397
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:07,278
but you must learn

398
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:12,010
to cooperate with your Spirit.

399
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:16,278
It's not a cooperation that is just by-the-way.

400
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:24,051
It is to be the Spirit, the becoming of the Spirit fully.

401
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:27,751
is very important.

402
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:31,264
Nothing should stop that.

403
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:37,629
I hope today's announcement will help all of us

404
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:44,550
to have that understanding of our responsibilities

405
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:49,688
towards ourselves and towards our Creator.

406
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:55,069
It's nice to praise Me for My love,

407
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,232
it's nice to praise Me for whatever has happened

408
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:04,370
but to be very frank, I do not know if you are praising Me.

409
00:45:04,716 --> 00:45:08,683
I do not feel the praise

410
00:45:08,884 --> 00:45:15,477
because I am My Self, I am not Myself.

411
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:23,291
I see My Self as separate

412
00:45:23,492 --> 00:45:28,231
and then I tell Myself that, “ See,

413
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:31,299
You are Adi Shakti, all right,

414
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,445
but You have spoilt Your children.

415
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:42,984
You have not done full justice to them.

416
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:50,456
They take everything so easy and mundane.”

417
00:45:54,201 --> 00:46:01,823
So you have to, tomorrow, take a vow within your heart.

418
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:05,686
It's not the words that are important.

419
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:13,413
It has to be living action of your being, that should prove,

420
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:18,512
that should convince you that we are fully surrendered.

421
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,475
And the effects of that you'll feel in your own personality,

422
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:25,506
in your own being, in your own manifestation.

423
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,707
With so many saints,

424
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:32,329
why should I have any worry of spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:39,477
Because there are some who drag you down,

426
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:44,054
there are some adamant people, and there are some, still,

427
00:46:44,255 --> 00:46:46,846
who are possessed,

428
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:52,242
there are some who are murmuring souls.

429
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:58,910
Just don't pay any attention to them, they'll be all lost,

430
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:02,532
doesn't matter.

431
00:47:03,343 --> 00:47:10,179
We have to create the great day for us to be proud

432
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,022
that we belong to this great religion of Truth.

433
00:47:13,223 --> 00:47:18,274
There has been no religion so far which is the religion of Truth,

434
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:23,539
it practices something and preaches something

435
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,794
and it has nothing to do with the incarnation.

436
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:35,417
You have to do something that people should say,

437
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:40,453
"We see our Mother in this person."

438
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:51,296
Today is a day when I want to bless some children.

439
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:53,995
I've blessed many children.

440
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:56,805
I would like to bless all the parents also

441
00:47:57,006 --> 00:48:00,739
to understandthat they have to contribute a lot

442
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,108
for the upbringing of the children.

443
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:07,033
There have been some very good tapes they have made in England,

444
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:11,865
how to help the children to grow properly

445
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:18,636
in this crazy Western life.

446
00:48:22,468 --> 00:48:28,085
And the one who has been the greatest enemy of yours

447
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:30,967
worked in this place.

448
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:37,323
He's the one who has ruined you

449
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:42,484
and you had to commit sin against the Holy Ghost,

450
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:46,200
sin against your Mother.

451
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:50,449
Now at this time,

452
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,489
in this place,

453
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,067
we have to turn our face

454
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,263
to all that was the past,

455
00:49:01,464 --> 00:49:11,147
and ascend into the new realm of bliss and joy.

456
00:49:11,854 --> 00:49:18,429
I assure you that with your dedication,

457
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,371
it will work out.

458
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:27,197
But just think in your mind what have we sacrificed so far?

459
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:37,777
No sacrifice is sufficient

460
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:42,087
but have we sacrificed anything?

461
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:49,312
That will make you understand that

462
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:52,540
your Mother has given you your second birth

463
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:55,207
without any difficulties.

464
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:59,861
She's taken up all the labor pains upon Herself.

465
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:04,978
Now you are grown up

466
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:09,778
and you have to understand that,

467
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:12,408
now you are grown up people

468
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:16,494
and you can't behave like children.

469
00:50:17,702 --> 00:50:20,111
That is over now.

470
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,207
Now you are grown up people

471
00:50:22,408 --> 00:50:27,713
you have to become responsible for this Maha Yoga

472
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:32,624
and for this great dharma that we have established.

473
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,573
The dharma that integrates all the dharmas.

474
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:39,357
The dharma that purifies anybody who comes near them.

475
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,332
Is the ocean of all the rivers.

476
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:48,361
All the rivers flow to this great ocean of Vishwa Dharma.

477
00:50:50,082 --> 00:51:00,371
So we have to mould ourselves to befit into the new pattern,

478
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:03,666
the new rhythms,

479
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:11,023
the new music of Divine flute.

480
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,055
Unless and until that happens

481
00:51:15,256 --> 00:51:26,180
I do not think that Western people have much chances.

482
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,326
If you have come for Sahasrara be prepared.

483
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:47,608
Tomorrow I would like to work out as much as possible.

484
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:54,867
I'm working twenty-four hours.

485
00:51:55,601 --> 00:52:00,038
Not a single minute I waste.

486
00:52:00,757 --> 00:52:09,071
And in the same way I hope you will dedicate your twenty-four hours

487
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:17,375
for your emancipation and the emancipation of the whole Universe.

488
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:22,365
May God bless you all.

489
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:58,636
Water.

490
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:17,414
So may God bless you.

491
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,448
[Should I make a very quick translation...]

492
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,217
Okay. You can make a quick translation...

493
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:01,068

494
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:28,421
Thank you.

495
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:43,964
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for this promise.

496
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,751
Today I thank the sun and I thank the wind

497
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:57,483
and now I thank you for this promise.

498
01:00:58,303 --> 01:01:00,904
I’m a very simple, innocent Mother,

499
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,964
can be pleased very easily,

500
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:06,875
but do not play games with Me.

501
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,813
Do not play games with Me.

502
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:13,071
Innocence can be very powerful also.

503
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:16,514
Don’t play games with Me.

504
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,001
So now, the children are there how to be named?

505
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:16,352
That's it.

506
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:19,501
May God Bless you.

507
01:02:20,065 --> 01:02:25,403
It is a son? You have been blessed. Alright?

508
01:07:00,778 --> 01:07:04,369
I think let us meditate for about ten minutes.

509
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:07,210
Would be a good idea.

510
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:48,275
Keep your eyes open.

511
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:57,277
Now all the children should put their hands link this.

512
01:07:57,478 --> 01:07:59,183
All right?

513
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:01,845
And watch Me.

514
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:44,373
Lift your tongues and put them back

515
01:08:44,574 --> 01:08:48,019
as much as possible.

516
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:51,765
Turn it backward.

517
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:59,542
Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip.

518
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,388
Now put your chin down, touching your…

519
01:09:16,605 --> 01:09:19,635
don’t close your eyes.

520
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:26,122
In complete surrender,

521
01:09:27,857 --> 01:09:30,075
put the chin.

522
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:38,639
But don’t close your eyes.

523
01:09:43,317 --> 01:09:47,097
Pay attention to your Sahasrara.

524
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:57,014
Loosen your hands fully on the sides,

525
01:09:57,215 --> 01:10:01,785
make them loose. Sit straight.

526
01:10:13,123 --> 01:10:16,412
Do not touch the palate.

527
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:41,179
Now breathe in.

528
01:10:42,935 --> 01:10:45,794
Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is.

529
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,770
Breathe in.

530
01:10:55,020 --> 01:11:00,678
Now raise your stomach, without taking out the breath, upward,

531
01:11:00,879 --> 01:11:05,521
pushing the air upward towards the lungs.

532
01:11:06,515 --> 01:11:09,718
Push your stomach in.

533
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:19,659
Attention on the Sahasrara.

534
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,725
You start seeing light through Sahasrara.

535
01:11:37,015 --> 01:11:40,718
Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes.

536
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,034
Now leave it.

537
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:56,203
Leave it now.

538
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,914
Raise your head.

539
01:12:06,264 --> 01:12:09,553
Now put back your heads.

540
01:12:10,354 --> 01:12:12,196
Put the fingers [in the ears].

541
01:12:12,397 --> 01:12:14,379
Put the attention to your Sahasrara, that’s all.

542
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,467
Don’t say anything, no mantras.

543
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:24,266
Take out your tongue,

544
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:27,404
push it back.

545
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,146
Take in your breath.

546
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,638
Push the stomach.

547
01:12:48,262 --> 01:12:50,496
That’s good.

548
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:13,146
Now watch Me continuously without blinking.

549
01:13:16,853 --> 01:13:20,253
Without any pressure on the eyes.

550
01:13:30,863 --> 01:13:33,895
Attention on the Sahasrara.

551
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:29,815
You can do it without blinking.

552
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:44,173
May God bless you.

553
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:51,389
This is it, physically, we have worked out our attention,

554
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:58,832
on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya.

555
01:15:07,392 --> 01:15:10,790
The left Vishuddhi is still there.

556
01:15:12,324 --> 01:15:18,228
Now put your head more on the right side,

557
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:21,460
loose, like this.

558
01:15:22,788 --> 01:15:26,889
With the attention on the Sahasrara, looking at Me.

559
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,528
Put it loose.

560
01:15:33,346 --> 01:15:36,455
Hand to be loose.

561
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:41,751
Loosen it.

562
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:53,455
Now better.

563
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:06,569
You feel the Kundalini rising?

564
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,600
Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini.

565
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:17,074
Raise.

566
01:16:18,298 --> 01:16:21,290
Attention on your Sahasrara. Don’t close your eyes,

567
01:16:21,491 --> 01:16:23,524
push back your head.

568
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:25,529
One.

569
01:16:26,185 --> 01:16:28,388
Again.

570
01:16:29,213 --> 01:16:30,958
Sit straight.

571
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:34,401
Take it up on your head.

572
01:16:34,602 --> 01:16:36,277
Two…

573
01:16:49,268 --> 01:16:51,029
three.

574
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:53,810
Now a bandhan.

575
01:16:54,385 --> 01:16:56,650
One,

576
01:16:58,260 --> 01:16:59,775
two.

577
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,327
Do it properly, systematically.

578
01:17:02,528 --> 01:17:05,838
Three. All of us should do properly. Three…

579
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:08,229
four…

580
01:17:09,884 --> 01:17:11,408
five…

581
01:17:11,823 --> 01:17:13,897
Try to wait as I am doing it…

582
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:16,129
six…

583
01:17:18,818 --> 01:17:20,613
seven.

584
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,149
Still we have not done it properly.

585
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:31,546
We all should do in one rhythm. Let’s do it again.

586
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,536
One. slowly…

587
01:17:38,004 --> 01:17:41,363
two, with attention on the Sahasrara…

588
01:17:42,798 --> 01:17:45,493
three…How do I do it? …

589
01:17:46,594 --> 01:17:48,204
four…

590
01:17:50,484 --> 01:17:52,539
five…good…

591
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,461
six.

592
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:59,391
Attention on Sahasrara…seven.

593
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:06,961
Rising?

594
01:18:08,005 --> 01:18:10,563
Let’s have the last binding…

595
01:18:18,138 --> 01:18:19,656
Now see.

596
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:29,201
Clear?

597
01:18:35,402 --> 01:18:37,348
Tremendous.

598
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,348
May God bless you.

599
01:18:45,498 --> 01:18:49,586
[Shri Mataji, if you permit I’d like to say that]

600
01:18:49,787 --> 01:18:52,436
[if there are some people who cannot decide that]

601
01:18:52,637 --> 01:18:55,055
[Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing in their life,]

602
01:18:55,256 --> 01:18:57,662
[they should not come to the puja tomorrow.]

603
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:01,830
Of course. For tomorrow’s puja

604
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:08,205
we should not have people who are not at least in Nirvichara.

605
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:12,951
Means if they still think that “Sahaja Yoga will not suit me,”

606
01:19:13,152 --> 01:19:16,486
and all that, we don’t want such mediocres. Please don’t come.

607
01:19:16,687 --> 01:19:19,411
Nothing will work out with them, they are useless people for Me,

608
01:19:19,612 --> 01:19:21,160
absolutely.

609
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:24,781
If they have to come to the puja they must know that,

610
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:29,396
you have to be of a caliber, otherwise please don’t come.

611
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:35,135
There are many who think like that,

612
01:19:35,336 --> 01:19:38,738
that Sahaja Yoga is the solution

613
01:19:38,939 --> 01:19:45,274
and that I am the chosen one for that solution.

614
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,758
Such people should only come tomorrow.

615
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:51,427
Otherwise all such people who think, this kind,

616
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:55,630
even now. Please, forgive Me.

617
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:58,057
I want you to forgive Me.

618
01:19:58,258 --> 01:19:59,882
I cannot have you for Sahasrara puja,

619
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,872
it’s too much for Me to work,

620
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:05,278
with such adamant nonsensical people here.

621
01:20:05,479 --> 01:20:09,638
I don’t want such adamant nonsensical people to come.

622
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:12,313
If they think they are doing some obligation,

623
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:15,110
they should know that there’s no obligation on Me,

624
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,743
but it’s obligation on you.

625
01:20:16,944 --> 01:20:20,643
Please none of you, of that kind, should come. I could feel it.

626
01:20:20,844 --> 01:20:23,087
There are some sitting within you.

627
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:26,398
So all such people should not try to come and disturb us.

628
01:20:26,599 --> 01:20:29,984
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga, work it out and then come back.

629
01:20:30,185 --> 01:20:32,738
I don’t know how much chances they have, but whatever it is.

630
01:20:32,939 --> 01:20:35,700
You must know that to come to Sahaja Yoga

631
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:40,965
is a special privilege

632
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:45,717
and anybody who thinks like that should not be here.

633
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:48,883
I’ll be very thankful.

634
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:52,240
Thank you very much.

635
01:21:06,941 --> 01:21:09,092
So now I think we will have dinner,

636
01:21:09,293 --> 01:21:12,626
after that we will have some music and sing songs.

637
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:17,321
And then tomorrow, we will have Sahasrara Puja.
