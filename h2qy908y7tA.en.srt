1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:15,730
[Music]

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:20,270
[Applause]

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:26,619
this pure spirit within us is the

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,619
reflection of God Almighty Sadashiva

5
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:46,429
it's like the Sun that falls in the

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:52,309
water and gives a clear reflection or

7
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:57,140
else it falls on the stone it doesn't

8
00:00:52,309 --> 00:01:01,850
give any reflection at all if you have

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:09,560
say the mirror the Sun will not only

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:15,230
fall on the mirror but will reflect back

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:22,220
its light in the same way in the human

12
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:28,899
beings the reflection of God Almighty is

13
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:33,110
expressed in a way your personality is

14
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:38,060
if your personality is clean and clear

15
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:41,079
innocent then that reflection could be

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,079
like a mirror

17
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:52,939
thus the saintly people they reflect God

18
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:57,170
Almighty in the proper manner in the

19
00:01:52,939 --> 00:02:02,509
sense that their own identification with

20
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:07,880
wrong things is no more when there is no

21
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:13,700
such identification and when a person is

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:19,000
absolutely the pure spirit then the

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:24,099
reflection of God reflects into us

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,140
luckily you all have got your

25
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:31,099
self-realization that means the

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,030
reflection of God my Almighty is already

27
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:43,579
working into your attention the

28
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:53,150
attention is enlightened by the power of

29
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:59,810
the Spirit so when you are in sahaja

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:03,919
yoga you have cleansed out yourself your

31
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:09,010
Kundalini has also cleansed and now you

32
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:14,049
have pure personalities that's why this

33
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:18,799
reflection is clearer and clearer and

34
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:22,699
people see it see it on your face see it

35
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:28,419
in your body they see it in your work in

36
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:33,079
your behavior in everywhere it is

37
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:37,069
difficult for people to really believe

38
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:40,729
in themselves that they could be the

39
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:45,169
reflection of God Almighty they have

40
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:47,959
some sort of a complexes about

41
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:52,099
themselves I think that they cannot

42
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:57,579
understand how they have suddenly become

43
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,579
the reflection of God Almighty

44
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:10,880
but they have a capacity and they can

45
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:13,890
become the reflection of God Almighty

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,459
for which they have to have faith in

47
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:21,320
themselves faith in their ascent to

48
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,920
believe that we have become that you

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,170
must have confidence in sahaja yoga and

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,260
confidence in yourself that you are on

51
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:35,550
the right path and that you are now

52
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,740
saved and nobody can attack you because

53
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,870
you have the complete protection of the

54
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:48,030
divine with the proper understanding

55
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:51,000
that you are the pure spirit if you

56
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,260
believe in that then you will be

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,160
surprised that you will be very

58
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:02,460
confident about what you are doing we

59
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,920
have now sahaja Yogi's all over but what

60
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,850
I find among sahaja Yogi's is this that

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:15,800
some of the sahaja Yogi's grow very fast

62
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:19,440
steadily strongly they achieve their

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,740
principle of Shiva that the first

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,320
achievement shows that from inside they

65
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:31,380
start getting detached now detachment is

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,370
not mental it's not mental it is not

67
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,820
that we have to take to some sort of a

68
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,430
sannyasa or you have to go to Himalayas

69
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,960
give up our families and all that but

70
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:50,250
the detachment is within oneself when

71
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:55,560
that detachment starts working the first

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:06:01,080
sign is that we become Joy's we become

73
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,700
happy now if you ask anyone why are you

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,240
unhappy

75
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:11,490
he'll talk about this why maybe his

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:16,250
house maybe his children maybe

77
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:22,680
his country maybe society whatever it is

78
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:25,380
so he gets absolutely upset or maybe

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:31,490
very unhappy to see things happening

80
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:36,230
around him now he is a realized soul

81
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:40,800
this unhappiness is not going to help

82
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:45,900
what is needed is now to know that you

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,680
can correct all these eats of the

84
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:54,570
society of the family of the whole

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:58,080
country by transforming others not by

86
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,270
feeling bad but while doing that the

87
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,130
main thing that you should have is a

88
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,180
complete detachment now how to achieve

89
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:12,750
detachment is the point to understand

90
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:16,860
yourself you should introspect try to

91
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:20,610
find out - what thing am i attached why

92
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,280
am i miserable for whom am I worried why

93
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,190
should I worry you should discover about

94
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,280
yourself what's wrong with you which

95
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:32,280
side is catching is it right or left

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,950
side it's meditation you can find out

97
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,770
are you attached to money are you

98
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,010
attached to business are you attached to

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:48,660
your family are you attached to your

100
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:51,930
country in a way which is not such or to

101
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:57,030
your culture which is not such then try

102
00:07:51,930 --> 00:08:00,570
to get rid of this attachment by

103
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:03,930
meditation this attachment will show on

104
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:07,050
your fingertips and you have to see for

105
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:11,160
yourself what centers you are catching

106
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:16,080
in which way are you in problem and then

107
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:19,230
you can clarify it very simply by taking

108
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,670
a very simple search treatment

109
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:27,030
I think here we fail that once we get

110
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,190
attached to something we don't even

111
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,350
think we are getting in time you think

112
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,770
we're doing very great thing because now

113
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:39,060
we love this person love that person she

114
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:41,430
was qualities the compassion part that

115
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,370
is no compassion of any kind to be

116
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,310
attached to any such things is no

117
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:53,780
compassion in you cannot have compassion

118
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:58,680
of Shiva because that compassion is very

119
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,780
few it is like as I have told you many

120
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,820
times it's like the SAP in the tree

121
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:08,670
which rises and goes to various parts of

122
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,280
this tree and then either it's

123
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,700
evaporates or goes down into mother

124
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,090
earth it's not attached if it gets

125
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:23,730
attached to one flower or to one leaf or

126
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:26,880
to one fruit then the whole tree will

127
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,420
suffer and also the flower will

128
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,650
discipline in meditating on your heart

129
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,980
on the Shiva tattva

130
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,800
the principle of Shiva you can

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,570
definitely detach and then the joy will

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,850
be the maximum you can have interest you

133
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,610
should have interest but in that

134
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,540
interest there should be enlightenment

135
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,750
that you cannot get attached what you

136
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,540
know is much higher much greater and

137
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,390
much more joy giving now these

138
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,660
attachments people think that is very

139
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,230
joy-giving it's a very wrong idea the

140
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,170
joy comes from your own source of your

141
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,080
spirit whether your husband is good

142
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:16,860
whether your children are good or bad

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:20,130
whatever they are they cannot give you

144
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,720
John it's only you can enjoy yourself

145
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:27,000
and this is why one becomes very

146
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,820
forgiving

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,090
when nobody can harm you then whom are

148
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,030
you going to be angry with that is

149
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,940
another great quality of Sadashiva is

150
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,810
that is extremely forgiving he goes up

151
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,720
to a point

152
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:47,470
till he destroys the whole work of

153
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,730
auditioning but otherwise he's very very

154
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:56,820
forgiving and he also is very balanced

155
00:10:51,730 --> 00:11:02,760
about it what I find that in the whole

156
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:11,590
atmosphere of today in the modern times

157
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:14,760
there's a big struggle going on which is

158
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:21,010
not she was culture

159
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:25,810
she was culture is they I should say the

160
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:33,480
Sahaj culture if you are sahaja Yogi's

161
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:39,700
if you have compassionate understanding

162
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:43,510
of others feelings and also you should

163
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:47,680
have readiness to look after not only

164
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,460
sahaja Yogi's also non sahaja yoga then

165
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,930
your compassion will become effective

166
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,830
you should have also collective

167
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:59,940
meditation in your ashrams

168
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:03,160
will be a good idea if you can try

169
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,240
collective meditation will be nice but

170
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,110
you don't have to give vibrations

171
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,030
training you don't have to look after

172
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,790
the chakras of others you just bother

173
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,270
yourself what's wrong with you and now

174
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:20,910
whatever is the solution for your ascent

175
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:24,700
if you put because the responsibility of

176
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,840
the whole world rests on sahaja Yogi's

177
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,510
this you know that there's no way out

178
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:36,220
without sahaja yoga to save humanity

179
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:38,360
from all kinds of problems sahaja yoga

180
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,639
has come on this earth

181
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,230
so it is your responsibility to keep

182
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,660
yourself in proper shape as far as

183
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,639
sahaja Yoga is concerned get rid of your

184
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:55,910
left and get rid of your right and then

185
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:58,429
to spread sahaja yoga not by bombastic

186
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:02,420
words or aggressiveness but with love

187
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:05,059
and compassion I am sure we have done a

188
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,629
lot we have achieved a lot but there are

189
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:11,569
still some points here and there which

190
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,749
is a very unpleasant task for me to

191
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:19,309
correct them or whatever it is I have to

192
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:22,970
say that is working and everybody should

193
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:25,519
look at themselves and feel happy from

194
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,529
where they have come here and how far we

195
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,529
have to may God bless you

196
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,430
Oh
