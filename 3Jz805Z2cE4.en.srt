00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:08,101
Birthday Felicitation
Delhi, India, March 22, 2000

2
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:42,460
Our honored guest, our respected Home Affairs Ministry is here,

3
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:50,448
Mr. Advani, who has been always a very great Deshbhakt.

4
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:56,507
 I admired him because he loved his country; he is very patriotic.

5
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:59,698
And this is ...

6
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:23,122
And as you know, My father and mother both were very patriotic.

7
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:26,787
They sacrificed everything for the country,

8
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:34,301
 and I also was always condemned by everyone 
as being a very patriotic person.

9
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:47,196
We must love the country in which we are born.

10
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:54,670
There is some connection, very great connection,
 between yourself and your country.

11
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:59,563
And I have seen that after Sahaja Yoga, all those

12
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:05,437
who have been transformed into new visions and new ideas

13
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:12,070
always know what’s wrong in their own country, 
and so conscious of it.

14
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:17,735
 I am surprised that every one of them have been able to tell Me

15
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,818
 what’s wrong in their country and what should be done.

16
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:29,724
They never identified with the wrongs 
or the misdeeds of their country.

17
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,651
It’s very surprising.

18
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:36,178
On the contrary they said, “Mother, all these countries

19
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:40,321
require Your attention so that they should be corrected.”

20
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,930
 Their politicians should be corrected.

21
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,636
Their citizens should be corrected

22
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:55,535
and that people should really evolve
into a new consciousness.

23
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:58,947
All of them have been working it out.

24
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,384
Now we have here very few Sahaja Yogis from abroad,

25
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,923
but I tell you it’s surprising how these Sahaja Yogis

26
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:14,480
have enlightened thousands and thousands 
of Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

27
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,783
 They are the ones who are working. 
I am not working like them.

28
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:26,561
 They work very hard. You can see the way 
we have got these felicitations from all these people,

29
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:33,084
 all because they approach these people, 
told them all about Sahaja Yoga,

30
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,947
they might have even given them realization.

31
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:39,113
And that’s how they have worked it out.

32
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,962
So we have to worry about our own country 
and its own problems.

33
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,213
 Why these problems are there?

34
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:52,576
 And I tell you, your wishes and your efforts

35
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:58,078
will definitely improve  the conditions of your own countries.

36
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:03,917
 And it’s happening in everywhere, also should happen in India.

37
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:14,175
Once we are realized souls, it is our most important duty is,

38
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:23,257
 first of all, look after your own societies,
 look after your own country.

39
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:28,777
If you can’t do that, what’s the use of getting Self-realization?

40
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:34,658
 Because Self-realization stands on one power - 
and the power of love.

41
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:39,528
And one art - art of selfless love.

42
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:44,342
 If that is there, immediately you start seeing the people

43
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:48,212
who are surrounding you, who are in your village,

44
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:55,037
who are also in the neighborhood,

45
00:04:55,236 --> 00:05:00,552
or also who are in your city and in your country.

46
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:09,458
Immediately you start understanding what’s the problem, 
even your own society.

47
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,549
 I have seen, after coming to Sahaja Yoga

48
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,311
 people have tried to improve so many things in their own society.

49
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:23,093
Now we have many Hindus, many Muslims,

50
00:05:23,415 --> 00:05:28,137
Christians, all kinds of people, but I was amazed at one thing.

51
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:37,776
 Once they got realization, they never identified 
with the wrong things of their society or of their religions.

52
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:42,097
On the contrary they wanted to improve it and work it out.

53
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,444
But there’s a very simple way of doing it.

54
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:50,906
You don’t have to go out of the way to change people or to

55
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:55,810
 make any sacrifices, nothing of the kind.

56
00:05:56,548 --> 00:06:01,250
Everybody today is suffering from some sort of anxiety,

57
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:07,115
some sort of problems, some sort of worries.

58
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:11,262
Also they are suffering from other problems.

59
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,897
Now if you can tell them that,
 “you can be transformed, you can be transformed.”

60
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:29,392
 Transformed into a being which is absolutely 
above all these worries, above all these problems.

61
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,428
 How can that be? One can ask.

62
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:37,234
Actually what happens that when you get your Self-realization,

63
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:44,782
your attention gets enlightened by the Self, means the Spirit,

64
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:50,050
and automatically you start dropping your destructive habits,

65
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:55,213
destructive thoughts and destructive activities.

66
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,385
You suddenly become so constructive.

67
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:03,397
Now I’ll tell you one thing, I was amazed 
when I was in Togliatti in Russia,

68
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:09,721
a news came to Me that the head of the mafia has become Sahaja Yogi.

69
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:16,580
 I was…I was so touched by it.

70
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:21,957
And he came to Me and he said, “I was doing all nonsensical things.

71
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:27,042
 I never got any satisfaction, no joy. But this is something.

72
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,839
 I really can feel the joy and satisfaction within myself.

73
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:35,480
Mother, whatever was my past, will You forgive me?”

74
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:42,522
I said, “Forgiven.

75
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:48,151
What is important is the present, 
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

76
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:55,286
 It’s such a credit to your spiritual growth
 the way you have achieved it.”

77
00:07:55,588 --> 00:08:02,149
 He said, “Now, I have that peace.
 I have that joy and I want to share it with others.

78
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,117
I could never share my money with others.
 I used to grab money from others.”

79
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,613
I said, “I don’t want to have any confessions. Finished!

80
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:15,500
Now, as you have become a Sahaja Yogi what will you do?”

81
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,138
Surprisingly, he was very sweet.

82
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,609
 He said, “I will send some onions to India.”

83
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,912
I said, “Why?”

84
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:26,422
He said, “Because there is a problem about onions.”

85
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:32,603
I thought, “look at this man – 
how genuine he has become, how humane.”

86
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:35,870
 I said, “We have no such problem. You don’t worry.”

87
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:42,939
And then you see his way of looking at things 
and working out things was so tremendous

88
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,177
that the same fellow who was a big mafia leader

89
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:53,691
is become such a big, great, honorable person in that area.

90
00:08:54,652 --> 00:09:00,585
 And then he wanted to be elected to the municipal some elections.

91
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:05,385
I said, “Go ahead. You’ll be elected.
 If you are not elected, doesn’t matter.”

92
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,767
But he got elected also.

93
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:14,954
So you see how things work out for a person 
who wants to be the Spirit.

94
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:18,613
 Shivaji has said “Swadharma Jagwawa”.

95
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:23,536
This is the only message he gave for the future.
 “Swadharma Jagwawa” –

96
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:27,924
 “Swa” means the Spirit. You awaken your Spirit.

97
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:31,063
 That is what we have to achieve.

98
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,742
 Because he himself was a realized soul,

99
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:40,238
so he said, “this is what you have to do,
 is to make your Spirit awaken.”

100
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:47,466
Now with that light of the Spirit what happens?

101
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:54,919
 You just see clearly, very clearly, you see what’s wrong with you,

102
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,409
what’s wrong with your society, what’s wrong in your country.

103
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:05,459
Everything you see very clearly, 
and you also have power to correct it.

104
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:12,313
 If you are aware of your power 
and if you have mastered it, you can do it.

105
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:19,071
 You can do it not only for yourself, but for your family, 
for your society, for everyone.

106
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,874
My husband always used to say,  “You are a Socialist

107
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,923
 because You can’t exist Yourself alone.

108
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:30,808
 You must share with others. You are so collective.”

109
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:36,152
But the thing is, you see, we have to understand 
we are a collective.

110
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,621
We cannot exist alone anywhere,

111
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,210
we are all collective. We are not aware of it.

112
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,033
But when you become aware of it, you are so surprised

113
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,709
 that you are part and parcel of the whole.

114
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:58,591
That you don’t have to look for company
 in your own society, in your own samaj. Nothing.

115
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,504
 What you want is just to have the company of all the Sahaja Yogis,

116
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:13,512
 and this has proved beyond doubt 
that if you are spiritually awakened,

117
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,400
 you have no quarrels with each other, no hatred, no competition.

118
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,927
 I have not seen anybody doing that in Sahaja Yoga.

119
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:31,740
And that is how things have become so much better
 for all of you together and also outside.

120
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:38,650
One of the ambassadors, 
she told Me that, “Mother, we are very happy.”

121
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,645
I said, “Why?”

122
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,748
“Because we are not competitive. 
So everybody is happy with us.”

123
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:50,224
This is what it is: that you realize
 that you don’t have to worry about

124
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:55,564
getting something higher position, getting into something very rich,

125
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:59,122
you can say properties. No!

126
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:03,343
Because the satisfaction part is within you.

127
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:09,214
You are so satisfied within yourself that you don’t run after things.

128
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,996
 Like the economics, the modern economics, as it is,

129
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:23,552
 it is based on one simple factor
 that human beings are never satisfied.

130
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,701
 Today they want something, they’ll

131
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,301
run for it and do every sort of thing and make money, get it.

132
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,375
Then they are not satisfied.
They want to have something else.

133
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,111
And then they want to have something else.

134
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:43,368
This is the basis of economics - I mean, modern economics.

135
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:46,085
 But Sahaja Yoga is different.

136
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,091
Sahaja Yoga economics is this thing: that I have got realization.

137
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,418
All right! I must share with others.

138
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:59,448
 If I have got the satisfaction I must share with others.

139
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:07,256
The sharing part is so important in Sahaja Yoga, 
and which people are doing with such beauty.

140
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:13,177
 As I told you the other day that 
we have to learn the art of loving.

141
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,365
 It’s very simple if you know how to say few sweet things,

142
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:25,759
how to give something sweetly, 
how to share with others very sweetly.

143
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:33,928
It is not difficult for you at all because 
you have got your Spirit to give you the joy.

144
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:39,050
 I know Sahaja Yoga has done wonders. 
People have given up drugs overnight.

145
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:42,424
Now in America they have a proposal for us

146
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,952
that we should start a drug addiction things

147
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:51,431
- to remove the drug addiction - some sort of a organization and all that.

148
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,858
And Sahaja Yogis said that, “We have one million dollar.

149
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,719
Can we do with that?” “No, No!”

150
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,203
they said,  “We’ll give you twenty-one million dollars.”

151
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:03,279
“What will you do with twenty-one million dollars?” I said.

152
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,267
 “If you want to build something for the drug addiction,

153
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,624
you only need them to come there.

154
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,892
 Overnight, they will give up their drugs.

155
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,574
I have seen that and there are some sitting here.”

156
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,918
Such a power your Spirit has!

157
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:30,450
Such a beauty it has, and such love and peace it has!

158
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:36,337
 Only it is to be brought into your attention 
which is going hither, thither, thither.

159
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,138
 Only if your attention is enlightened by the Spirit,

160
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:45,503
you become such a wonderful person.

161
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:51,520
 All these things as they had described in Sanskrit – 
the Kaam, Krodha, Mada, Matsa, Lobha, Moha –

162
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,533
 all of them drop by themselves.

163
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:58,621
All the anger, all the stupid things we do,

164
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:02,895
 and all the aggressive things we do, drops out.

165
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:09,672
I have asked some Sahaja Yogis to go to Kashmir 
and make them Sahaja Yogis.

166
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:13,137
 If you can make them Sahaja Yogis this problem will be over.

167
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:16,436
 And there are some willing to go there.

168
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,411
Some foreign Sahaja Yogis specially have offered

169
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:24,244
their services to go and change the people’s mind.

170
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:27,419
 Now we have! We have changed people,

171
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:34,287
 like we have now in a place called Benin, there are seven hundred -

172
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:41,618
 seven thousand - Muslims 
who were very fundamentalist,

173
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:44,209
they all have become Sahaja Yogis.

174
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:51,900
In Turkey, we have already two thousand Sahaja Yogis. In Turkey!

175
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:56,040
 So even fanaticism of any kind - among Hindus or

176
00:15:56,143 --> 00:16:01,047
among Muslims, among Christians - can be easily changed because

177
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:06,415
they will see the beauty of their Spirit,

178
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:11,586
and their religion itself will get enlightened.

179
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,467
They will see the beauty of their religion. 
They will see the oneness of all these religions,

180
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:25,910
and like that a global religion can be accepted
 where all religions will be understood properly.

181
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:31,077
There have been deviations in every religion and that’s why there’s a problem.

182
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,861
Can you fight in the name of religion when there is only one God?

183
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:40,046
They do because they are ignorant. I don’t blame them.

184
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,895
They have no light. But once they have the light,

185
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:48,537
they will understand what is the global nature of religion.

186
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:54,420
Now, you’ll be surprised that Sahaja Yoga - 
or we can call the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma -

187
00:16:54,534 --> 00:17:01,534
has been accepted in Russia as a religious identity.

188
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:15,394
But it is not religion like other religions are.

189
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:19,329
 It is not at all of that kind.

190
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,206
It’s a religion where only we believe in compassion,  love

191
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:31,085
and also in our own power that nobody can touch you.

192
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,828
 Nobody can kill you.

193
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:40,246
You will be amazed that there was 
such a big earthquake in Turkey

194
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,681
 but Sahaja Yogis, none of them were touched.

195
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:50,750
Even their houses were completely all right when the rest was all destroyed.

196
00:17:55,962 --> 00:18:00,415
 So many places, so many places it has happened.

197
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,201
We had hurricane there - the same thing.

198
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,106
 All over, they are sending Me reports, “Mother,

199
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,564
how all the Sahaja Yogis are saved.”

200
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,600
How they are perfectly all right!

201
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:15,735
Because youare protected by the Divine power!

202
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:21,797
 We have to believe in the Divine power, 
which all the religions have believed.

203
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:28,693
 Then the problem comes whether 
you should believe in the form or formless.

204
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:34,763
 Then you will realize that with the formless 
only you can understand the form.

205
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:41,008
Very simple thing it is to look at, 
but it is really extremely surprising.

206
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:50,533
For example, once I said that Mecca is 
Meccashwara Shiva written down in our books.

207
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:52,991
But I didn’t know that I just said it.

208
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:59,161
Now I read an article that they were all worshippers of Shiva.

209
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:07,210
And this is something surprising that 
Mohammad Sahib never talked about any religion.

210
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:12,787
Nobody has read even that, we can say, the Koran. 
Nobody has read.

211
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:17,061
We have a very good book written on Koran,
 which of course I guided,

212
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,961
 and it’s so clearly saying what Mohammad Sahib has said.

213
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:24,501
I mean also this brings discredit to people.

214
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:28,204
Christ never said things which Christians are saying.

215
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:29,839
Same with the Hindus.

216
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,733
They are doing things which was never,
 never written in any shastra.

217
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:42,088
 Very surprising that these people who are in charge of religion

218
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,707
 they are the ones who are spoiling the image 
of religions and creating this problem.

219
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:53,070
 I don’t know why they want to do it.
 What is the use?

220
00:19:53,417 --> 00:20:01,919
Now, regarding…regarding Sakaar and Nirakaar
 it’s very simple to be understood.

221
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:12,790
After getting realization you can feel the Spund, 
you can call it – or vibratory awareness is there.

222
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:18,889
 With that you can feel what is truth what is not.

223
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:27,519
Now I would say that there is no truth in worshipping a statue

224
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:34,164
 which is created by a drunkard or a person 
who is using it for money.

225
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:41,609
 But even in the Bible it is said that 
whatever created by the sky

226
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:46,052
or by the Mother Earth should not be disrespected.

227
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:48,881
This is what we call as the Swyambhu.

228
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:58,110
 But Swyambhus for people who are not realized souls
 is just a sort of a ritual, a karmakand.

229
00:20:58,585 --> 00:21:04,889
It’s just a karmakand. They don’t understand
 whether this, whatever is a Swyambhu or not.

230
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,494
Now, you being Sahaja Yogis, 
you have seen what I have told you that “go and see

231
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,455
which are the Swyambhus”  and you have accepted it.

232
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:18,334
 I know in Tukarama’s place, you all were jumping

233
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:25,029
and very enjoying it because 
you could feel the chaitanya, you could feel the vibrations.

234
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:30,978
So first you should know about Nirakaar 
and then you can find out about Sakaar.

235
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,582
There is no quarrel about it. But if you are not a realized soul,

236
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:42,316
 how can you say which place is Swyambhu and which is not?

237
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,050
So the whole problem is solved,

238
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:52,064
but first you must have the knowledge,
 the knowledge of vibrations.

239
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,756
 Now if you ask Me a very serious question 
that we are having in our country,

240
00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:03,394
which I would like to tell you about is about Shri Rama’s mandir.

241
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:08,796
Was Shri Rama was born there or not? He was!

242
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:20,040
 You can feel it onto your hands.
 You can feel it. All of you can feel it.

243
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,831
He was born there. No doubt!

244
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,413
 But for that, what is there to fight?

245
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:29,601
Whether it’s a masjid or anything Shri Rama was born there.

246
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:32,659
Vibrations are there, whatever it may be.

247
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:40,117
But to glorify Him you must have a temple, doesn’t matter.

248
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:43,970
Whether you have a masjid or a temple is the same,

249
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:50,197
 and if you want to have a temple you must do it 
after realization not before that.

250
00:22:54,187 --> 00:23:00,469
 And also you should put there only realized souls who 
will be in charge of the Puja.

251
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:07,632
Then only you will do real credit to that great soul of Shri Rama.

252
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:12,738
 All of them here, whether whatever their country from, 
they know Shri Rama.

253
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:17,466
Not only that, but they know where He is within us

254
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,009
and they know how to worship Him.

255
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,150
They also know about Mohammad Sahib.

256
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:25,554
 They also know about Christ. 
They know the truth about Them

257
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,532
within their own body, within themselves.

258
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:33,269
Once that is the knowledge, the true knowledge,

259
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:37,298
the absolute knowledge then what is the quarrel about?

260
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:42,024
 Everybody feels the same way. 
What will you quarrel for?

261
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:46,902
 If I say that My country, India, is a Yogabhumi; all right,

262
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:52,366
 you ask all of them whether they come from
 this country or that country,  all Sahaja Yogis they will say so.

263
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:58,411
 So when they come from abroad, they bow to this country,

264
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:04,681
while we Indians may not. They do, 
because they know this is a Yogabhumi

265
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:12,132
and the Kundalini of the whole universe is inside this Yogabhumi.

266
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:19,214
So all these great things about our country

267
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:25,543
are to be understood through the vibrations
which Adi Shakaracharya called as Spund.

268
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:29,619
 Actually most of their poetry could not -

269
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:35,651
because they were not prose - could not explain 
to normal people what it was.

270
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,006
 But I think that if you go deep into these matters

271
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:47,688
 and understand the absolute knowledge
 about all this through your Spund,

272
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:52,369
 through your vibrations, you will know what is the truth.

273
00:24:52,479 --> 00:25:00,209
Because what’s the use of fighting for falsehood?
 It’s like fighting the darkness.

274
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:03,425
Why not have light and see for yourself?

275
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,455
I, today, I have taken some liberty with you, Sir,

276
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:11,586
 because I wanted to tell you that in this country of ours

277
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,499
 we have the greatest knowledge about Buddha

278
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:25,051
 Whole Sahaja Yoga is based, whatever I know,
 is from - mostly from - our shastras.

279
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:29,550
 It’s not ritualism. It’s the deeper knowledge.

280
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:33,277
All saints, whether you take Kabir, you take Nanaka,

281
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:37,973
Mohammad Sahib, anyone – 
all of them have said, “Seek yourself within”.

282
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,929
Why did they say so? Why did they say so?

283
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,663
Because inside is the truth, the absolute truth,

284
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:51,244
and with that absolute truth all these stupid, 
stupid things will drop out

285
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,285
 and you become a different personality.

286
00:25:54,365 --> 00:26:00,860
 As it is, the time has come for
 the whole world to change and transform.

287
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:08,162
But you know, I now request you all to do lot of work for Me

288
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:16,116
 I have done that was possible for Me
 to work it out and it has worked, no doubt.

289
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:23,320
But you all can do it and change you -first of all your own society,

290
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:28,931
change your own countrymen, change also, then globally you can go.

291
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:34,166
You can help, say for example, in India, 
some people can come and help here,

292
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:37,576
and from India some could go and help there.

293
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:40,965
So now you are well equipped with that knowledge.

294
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,081
So you should come and work it out.

295
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:49,024
 And, I must thank people from Australia who went now to Orissa.

296
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:55,781
 And they have formed nine centers - nine centers of Sahaja Yoga.

297
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,981
This is happening and you know you can do it.

298
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:12,715
 You are quite capable of giving realization to people.

299
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:16,747
And, please now I request all of you

300
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:23,996
to try this gift that you have, to be shared with others.

301
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:31,359
[Rest of the talk is in Hindi]
