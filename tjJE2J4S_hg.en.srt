1
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:14,918
But we must understand that, 
once we have come to Sahaja Yoga,

2
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:19,417
once our Kundalini has been awakened,

3
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:26,375
then, all of us have now become 
part and parcel of one body,

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:34,751
of one body of the great Primordial Being.

5
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:40,042
In a body, as human bodies are,

6
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,417
supposing a finger is numb,

7
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:50,751
then all the body’s attention is 
on that finger to cure it.

8
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:58,292
And all the other fingers 
and the whole body, the brain,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,083
the mind you can call it,

10
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,213
everything is worried about that finger ,

11
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,292
how to make it all right.

12
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,292
Naturally there is no ego 
for these fingers,

13
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:19,209
so nobody feels hurt or bad.

14
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,797
And the fingers are also anxious to do it, 
because they can feel

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,042
the problem of the finger which is numb.

16
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:36,125
If there is some problem, say, 
internally within your body,

17
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:43,375
all the cells which are needed 
to correct that problem will rush.

18
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,918
The blood will rush. The heart will pump.

19
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,751
Everything will work out 
in a very co-coordinated way,

20
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,667
but nobody feels hurt.

21
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:56,000
that “Why should I take help from anyone?”.

22
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,000
Neither the one who helps 
is frightened or afraid

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,792
or also feels the ego.

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,125
The reason is, the cells of the body

25
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:13,959
are under the complete control of one brain,

26
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:19,584
or one personality, or one Self.

27
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:28,667
But in Sahaja Yoga, this collectivity 
is not yet established.

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,042
That’s why people feel hurt, people hurt each other.

29
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:43,834
They have fear

30
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:49,250
of another ‘cell’, which is the brother ‘cell’,

31
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,209
witch is the partner ‘cell’,

32
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,500
which is the part and parcel of your own being.

33
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:59,500
Are we afraid of our eyes? Or afraid of our nose?

34
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:03,709
Are we afraid of our hands, or of our feet?

35
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,125
And this collectivity is such a vicious circle

36
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,209
that unless and until you become really collective,

37
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:19,042
you cannot feel another person.

38
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,250
And unless and until you have 
that sense of responsibility

39
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,918
of collectivity built in yourself,

40
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,334
you cannot help another person.

41
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,751
So certain amount of growth is needed in the whole body

42
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:39,542
to be sensitive enough to help each other,

43
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,959
to be wise enough to help each other,

44
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:48,834
to be resourceful enough to really nourish another.

45
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,375
And that development has to come again through collectivity;

46
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,125
is most surprising.

47
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:05,876
I know sometimes people feel 
that there are Sahaja Yogis

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,500
who are not even of one mind.

49
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,484
I agree.

50
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:17,125
That somebody will say, 
“Your Vishuddhi is catching,”

51
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:20,062
another will say, “Your heart is catching.” 
Another will say,

52
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,691
“Your void is catching.”

53
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,834
They don’t say that all of them will say the same thing:

54
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,584
one will say this, one will say that, one will say that.

55
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:33,000
The reason is, some of them have developed

56
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,751
certain sensitivity to a certain centre,

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,083
but not to all the centres.

58
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,209
And that’s how there can be

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
a difference of opinion as there should not be at all.

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,500
So firstly we must all know that we are still growing.

61
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,834
We have to still grow.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,667
In Sahaja Yoga even if you get 
your Realization, that doesn’t mean

63
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,292
you have suddenly become John the Baptist.

64
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,709
We all have to grow.

65
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:14,834
And for growing and growth 
we have to discard something

66
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,375
and we have to accept something.
