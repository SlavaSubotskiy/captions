1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,340
Culie, have you written it down?

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:13,360
Hello, How are you? May God bless you.  You can sit on the chair. Be comfortable.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,000
Ask Culie to write it down for him.

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:17,040
Shri Mataji: Hello! How are you Douglas? How are you? Douglas Fry: Very well! Shri Mataji: Looking very fine! Just like a flower, beautiful! See what beautiful children I have, just like these petals over here.

5
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:31,600
Can you open a window for a while. Just open the window for five minutes.

6
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:57,300
Sit comfortably. Be comfortable, like this. I mean. Yes, be very comfortable. One has to be very, very comfortable, very comfortable.

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,600
She got it even before she had seen me! Because that shows that it’s flicking in the air.

8
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,280
Because that shows that it’s flicking in the air.

9
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,320
Because.

10
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:39,280
Today I want to tell you about further meditation: how we have to go and how we have to understand ourselves.

11
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,280
You see the thing is so far you have had habits

12
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,980
of dealing with things and your practices.

13
00:02:50,280 --> 00:03:01,220
how you have dealt with worldly problems, with your personal problems, your physical problems, body problems,

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,780
but now as you have entered into the Kingdom of God and the power of God is flowing through you,

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:19,880
you must know that your solutions and your styles have to be different now.

16
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,920
That is... You have to...

17
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,000
put your attention at the disposal of God.

18
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Actually in your attention His light is flooded.

19
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,540
I’ll try to explain it, because it’s just the opposite of what you have so far known.

20
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,640
You always thought that you had to put your attention to a point

21
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,180
and then you have to move

22
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,840
then you have to attack the subject or attack the problem

23
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:01,160
put all your energies divert to it and... Hello, how are you?

24
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:17,920
and to... then take upon your self the responsibility the complete

25
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,980
technique of the whole thing, how to work it out and...That was the sort of a ...

26
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:39,600
a life's experience for you. You would use all your experiences that you have had

27
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,860
about such a problem about a particular type of problem

28
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,600
all others, whatever they have had all the books that are available and even out of sorts of these

29
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,720
enterprises that have been for a particular problem, alright, - then you attack it, that problem.

30
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,660
and then you find that when you try to attack it

31
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,240
just slips out of your hands, you just can not find it, you do not understand how you have missed it

32
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,740
The Sahaja is a very different system: now you have entered into a Kingdom of God - you are saints.

33
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,300
And everything that was built so far is for your good. You have to experiment and see for yourself.

34
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,680
But the thing is: you must give it a chance.

35
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,420
Your attention itself is not located right.

36
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,920
You don’t have to go to any books, you do not have to go anywhere.

37
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,760
Your attention itself is flooded with that light which is dynamic.

38
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now, if anything comes in your attention, you just..

39
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,140
connect your attention with the Divine's attention

40
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,720
How? By saying: “All right, let it be done.

41
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,820
Let this be done. It’s your wish.”

42
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,940
Thy will be done, this is what you should say: thy will be done.

43
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,320
You just say this you will be surprised.

44
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,080
And then the whole mechanism, that enlightened attention of yours

45
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,920
is the part of the attention of God Itself.

46
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,860
So the whole thing will work out, the whole force. As you have worked for your personal problem before,

47
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,560
now the whole of it will work out and it will happen. It’s such a wonderful thing.

48
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,420
And the attention has to be there, has to be in the subtle.

49
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,760
Because your attention is in the gross that’s why you attack the problem in this manner.

50
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:40,320
If your attention is somehow or other made more attracted towards the subtle then, what happens

51
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,560
[is] the effect of that will be shown. Otherwise also, you will it. But then you will see it very clearly how it acts.

52
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,220
For example now, say,

53
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,680
I come in my room and you have done all these things so beautifully, it's all worked out so nicely,

54
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,980
then when I come in here and I see all that,

55
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,320
I don’t see every minute part of it, I don't see how it is done,

56
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,020
this, that, but I just stand here, and I feel the whole thing within me, bubbling.

57
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:24,140
It works, and it gives me joy, gives me joy, fills me with joy. Different types of joy start flowing in my body, in my being.

58
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,720
In my full understanding it’s flowing, it’s making me happy.

59
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,100
Now I don't judge it on the way the people who judge.

60
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,460
They would immediately come supposing you see it is another level person.

61
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,740
He would come and see in a very gross way.

62
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,120
He’d say, “Oh this one, it would be nice. And this is a stone and this is the thing.” and “This should not have been here and that should not have been there!”

63
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,420
and “How much you paid for that?” It goes on, on like that.

64
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,380
You see it goes on on like that you see.

65
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:01,060
But a person who is divine, he may talk the way you are talking, but in that also its play the Divine is playing its part.

66
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,100
It is just playing its part just to make a little, sort of a, hallucination for you.

67
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,780
But inside that flow of the Divine it’s just to give you joy, to get you alright.

68
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,520
Even when such a person scolds you or says something it has that manner.

69
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,240
In the same manner if you make yourself very very subtle

70
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,640
How? That any gross ideas come into you, “You just shut up! I don’t like you.”

71
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:35,000
Gradually your mind will be so trained, I mean, it would be so much understanding the nectar of subtleness that it would reject automatically.

72
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,880
You will live in this world but you will not feel it.

73
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,340
That'd be the way you feel it, you will not be involved.

74
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:50,100
You'll be eating food,  all right very good and very nicely this, that, but then you don't know what you are eating. You are just enjoying the love that is in that food.

75
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,140
So to be subtle, to be that love, you see, your attention has to be on love.

76
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,300
If your attention is guided by the price of the thing,

77
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
the quality of the thing,

78
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,960
and all that then that subtleness can not be.

79
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,800
So to be subtle is also a mental activity after Sahaja Yoga.

80
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,420
Now many people Sahaj they think is a standstill stuff - it is not.

81
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,820
Sometimes you misunderstand the meaning of ‘Sahaj’.

82
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:31,300
That is like a, first I say that the car will start sahaja, all right? But you put the accelerator on.

83
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,260
You have to manoeuvre the thing,

84
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,020
That is most Sahaja because you have become a Sahaj.

85
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:46,160
If your attention is sahaja then automatically you’ll manage. When you have mastered the manoeuvring of the car you just do it automatically, sahaj.

86
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:56,460
But to be that Sahaja you have to first of all try. If you don't learn that, then that will mean that you are just at a standstill.

87
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:06,540
“Oh I have left it to Sahaj Yog, when the vibrations will come, they’ll come!” It won’t! Because there are still problems with you. You are not yet that subtle.

88
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,900
So to remove that, now you can remove, to make yourself Sahaja.

89
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,320
To cleanse yourself, absolutely, you have to work out a little.

90
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:24,120
For example, now with vibrations like this you have an imbalance with the body, supposing, then you have to remove it. You know how to remove it.

91
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,160
This is what has happened with Sahaja Yoga, that you know there is an imbalance, you know that my such chakra is catching, that this has happening.

92
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,320
Now you bring it to the subtle point, [which] is first of all you have to work on it physically. All right?

93
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,340
To make yourself absolutely clean there are so many ways.

94
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:52,180
First and foremost is feeling the vibrations in different hands, feeling them, how it works out.  Which is more, which is less, how it’s coming. Why is it this thing?

95
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,320
Then finding out, “How? Where did I catch it?” “All right, Such and such person!” Beat him with shoes.

96
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:08,700
These are all gross things and have to be taken away by gross things. You beat them. For me I don't need any beating of it, only just looking at it, it runs away.

97
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,360
If I have been there only itself runs away. I don't have to go ahead.  But for you people, you do catch.

98
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,640
So for that reason you have to be careful: physically you have to work it out. So there’s so many ways.

99
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:29,740
Like even, many people I was speaking say, “Oh we are now Realised, why should we sit in the water?” No! Everyday as we have a bath, we have to do it.

100
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:42,800
Mother knows many things, you know. It’s a very good idea, you see. Just to avoid what is there?  “Now we are all right, you know, the vibrations we are getting in our had!”

101
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:52,780
But you are not subtle! Still you catch from others. So all these physical things are to be done still.

102
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,840
You need it because still it is, we should say, problem [is sustained] so it is not yet absolutely perfectly a healthy person.

103
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,960
So we have to do it, that’s one thing. Physically, whatever is the physical thing you know about.

104
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,620
Even if you want you can take it out, like that, if there’s a problem. Now this fellow was nearly taken up like that. You can!

105
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:17,140
You want to pull it up. It does! It does work, it is symbolic. Every action. After all is a sahaja action.

106
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,000
Nobody does like this. You do it. Because it’s hot and terrible you just take it out.

107
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:34,820
If you see a realised-soul, a small little child, you'll be amazed. They will go to an airport, they will be going on like this.

108
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,240
All the time they will be going on like this, on their own! You don't have to tell them.

109
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,380
But for you, you must understand that, that state is still there, so that you must feel it. And you should really throw it away.

110
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Physically it has to be done.

111
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,800
It’s an exercise and you cannot be ‘sahaja’ about it, no.

112
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,040
There is a difference between Me and you, so you have to work it out.

113
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:09,340
Whose who think they are realised - all right - finished! “Now we are on top of the world!” You should grow, evolve in understanding, and respect others,

114
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,360
that, “No, we have to still rise and still rise and still rise.” This is a physical side, means very important.

115
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,520
Then the second side is our mental side.

116
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:28,700
Now mentally also all the time we are bombarded with things from all over. You read the newspaper in the morning, it's finished!

117
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,480
You catch on your agnya, catch on your mooladhara — horrible thing it is. It’s a sadistic thing. If you see that you just get a fright, the way things are described.

118
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,980
So what you have to do, mentally, you must understand these are horrid things.

119
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Now, you cannot say that, “I am innocent I am reading this, it's all right!” No, you catch. So what you [should] do is to put a bandhan.

120
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:58,240
And if you want today to read, you read two lines, and if you think it's worth it, read it. Otherwise what’s the use reading pornography?

121
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,540
That’s not meant for us. We are different people. You must know we are a different class.

122
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,140
This is not meant for us at all. So what’s the use of reading anything that’s not going to give us pleasure? Read something pleasurable, something nice.

123
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:19,540
Like the lecture of Sadat, I can say or something like that. Then you go to say, such things, or something like that, then you go ahead.

124
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:28,300
And when you read it you support that person inside. But if you read pornography, you are caught and you become one of them.

125
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:36,140
Because of the habits, just the old habits, you see. These are old habits. Anything that you see must you read? Not necessarily.

126
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:42,380
You see people have habits of reading all the advertisements on the way. If they miss one they'll turn round to see that they didn’t miss it.

127
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,140
Another they’ll see this and this. These are the habits we have. So we have to make our attention subtler:

128
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,840
“Oh where are you going?” So be alert about it. So mentally we have to be alert.

129
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:04,060
Then another thing of mentally is to see what thoughts are coming to you. Still negative thoughts come to you, [there’s] no denying of the fact.

130
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:14,160
May not be about Sahaj Yoga, but may be it's about something else, may be about something in life. You might be dreaming about such things.

131
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:25,940
At that time what you have to do is to sit down and do a push with positive thoughts like, as I said a very good way they say [is] that, count your blessings one by one.

132
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:34,920
Say, “How fortunate am I? In this world there are so many people. Out of that even in this London there are so many.

133
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,760
Out of that I am the one who has found out really the Truth. How fortunate I am!

134
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,520
And I am the one who is going on the right path, I feel it. And I am moving.

135
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,360
If I have to move it on this path, let me be very, very positive. So let me move on this way.”

136
00:15:50,360 --> 00:16:02,500
When you start doing that you will be amazed that gradually these negative ideas will go away. Because even now you are attacked. You are very much attacked. And the ideas come to you.

137
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:12,040
And then, as your habits are, because you are all the intelligent people, and brought up with this intelligent atmosphere, there are styles I have seen.

138
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:23,260
The intelligent styles are very dangerous, they are more dangerous than foolish styles. The intelligent styles are that you take it in such a way that you cheat yourself.

139
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:32,640
All the time you start accepting things and you start cheating yourself. And these ideas get sedimented in your being, gradually.

140
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:39,160
And suddenly you find a big thing in your head and you say, “Oh, from where this has come in? What has happened to me?”

141
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:49,820
So be careful! Because these sedimentations will be settling down in you, gradually. And you have had those habits of intelligent way of doing things.

142
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,940
When you do intelligently? Actually what is intelligent doing, so many times, is just to push it upside down and bring it inside you.

143
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:06,100
You can see this is something so funny but it is so, that when you deal with something intelligently you know how to escape it,

144
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:12,640
and how to avoid it and how to make it look different to yourself.

145
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:23,720
You yourself, with intelligence, deceive yourself and make it look different and then you accept that thing, and that becomes a part and parcel of you and you are not aware of it.

146
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,740
Isn’t it Gregoire? It’s a common style, so be careful!

147
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:42,760
When you start clearing out your Vishuddhi part of it, you will be surprised the subtleness will start flowing in you, the subtleness will appear before you. The subtleness is a state. It is a state of your attention.

148
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,420
Your attention is gross outside. Now you think of some sort of a moon which is just a stone you can call it.

149
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:59,100
Then it starts little bit moving, becomes little, I should say, mobile, then gradually it becomes subtle.

150
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,620
The core is melting away, the outside is still hard. It’s like that is your attention. It starts melting in you.

151
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:17,260
Now you are in the core, you are not outside, but whenever you come in contact, the core part contacts with the gross, suddenly you start becoming one with it,

152
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,840
then the crust starts again becoming an immobile stuff and the core starts becoming strong.

153
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,860
Again you increase the core, it starts again to go out to periphery and the things stars melting. That is how the attention, if you can understand, is.

154
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,660
And that attention, which is enlightened in you, has to be kept all the time enlightened: no justification with yourself!

155
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,360
With others also we don't have to justify. It’s all right.

156
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:54,900
We think that we must grow, we must be all right, we must be very good and when we find somebody is troubling us, it’s rather difficult to tolerate a nonsense like that, it’s true.

157
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,260
But, for that, I am sitting down, you just tell me and I can manage it! You have seen [how] we have solved one problem very nicely, and we can solve all the problems.

158
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,380
It’s a very clever way, isn't it? That the subtle way! It just gets solved!

159
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:15,600
So we don’t have to worry about anything. You don’t have to think a 100 times! Though I am the person who has put you in problems you see,

160
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,400
“Do like this! You should have done like this! You should have put in effort like this!” But the problem I will be solving myself, you see.

161
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:29,720
But I will just make you run up and down to see that. On the contrary when you see me doing like that you should understand I am I am playing tricks with you!

162
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:41,600
So the problems can be solved just like that, if your attention is subtle. But if it is not the main the basic problem is that you cannot approach this.

163
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,380
The approach to the problem is only possible if you are a subtle being. If you are not a subtle being you cannot approach any problem.

164
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,860
So, to be subtle and to be there, to be Divine one has to understand the grossness that is covering you.

165
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:08,800
Through Kundalini you can because you can raise your Kundalini, see where it is hanging. “Now it’s very heavy here. It’s like a stone here. It’s thumping here.

166
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:17,520
It’s doing all these things.” Now, it’s a very gross way of looking at it, very gross way of looking at it. It is suggesting to you, something.

167
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:31,800
So what you have to do is to see for yourself now, at Sahasrara, that’s the place for Somebody we know. Then you just sit down and say, “Now what have I done? Why this problem?

168
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:39,220
If I have done anything like that, please forgive me!” It works out. It’s a simple way.

169
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:46,860
But first of all, foremost thing, is that, what is the substance you gave me? Is it a subtle substance that’s speaking or the gross one?

170
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:58,020
From which point are you speaking is the thing. Supposing you are speaking from that point where you are a governor general, everybody has to obey you!

171
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,120
But if you are speaking from the point where you are a peon, nobody is going to obey you.

172
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,400
So where is the attention is the thing. So mentally you have to work it out in your meditation.

173
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:18,540
Now you sit down for meditation, all right, mostly trying to be thoughtlessly aware. But if there are thoughts you should try to keep it down by saying,

174
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:27,860
“How fortunate that I have felt these vibrations, I felt it. And how happy I am about it! Now you get away all the negative thoughts!” That’s how you can fight it out.

175
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:37,780
Now whatever you do will lead you to Sahaja, not before. Before Realisation it has got no meaning, it was a dead car standing there, but now the car has started moving.

176
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,660
And whatever you do whatever you try, it will make you subtler and subtler.

177
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:53,420
Simple things like declaration that, “Yes, I am going to do this! I have decided to do it.” Put your mind to positive thinking: What are we going to do?

178
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:04,120
How are we going to do it? How are we going to work it out? You will be surprised how the things will come. But normally our habits are for our gross problems.

179
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:12,780
Now I would say Bombay Sahaja Yogis are quite developed they are quite good but still sometimes they really tumbled down very badly.

180
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:19,900
This time I thought they were a little bit proud than anything else because Delhi people were not so good at things and they had to come and do it.

181
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:37,900
And I think that Bombay people did feel that they were sort of lending a hand to Delhi people. It happened. But then they found themselves quite low and and all of them Humpty Dumpties sitting down there!

182
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,120
You see, so it can happen.

183
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,800
So anyone who feels that, “I have achieved everything!” or, “I have reached everything!” can have a Humpty Dumpty fall.

184
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:56,920
Because it was so beautifully played, you see. I'll tell you what happened: They came down and then in the Old Delhi we had no place to stay properly

185
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,500
so I said, “All right, you arrange my place in the guesthouse and the boys can stay in the boys hostel and the girls can stay in the girls hostel.”

186
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:23,600
“All right it can be done.” So then the gross thing came out. So one of the persons said that, “You see but the food in that boys hostel is full of oil and this and how can we eat there?” And I didn’t know about it, nobody told me.

187
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:32,180
And then they had to arrange it with somebody and they had to suddenly purchase all the food and everything and then to arrange a cook and these things.

188
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:41,800
And where they stayed was all full of bhoots! And they were all caught up in the head, terrible and this and that and they came to me.

189
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:48,260
So they said, “Mother what has happened to us? We came all the way and this is what has happened. Now we are all vomiting and this and that.”

190
00:23:48,440 --> 00:24:00,860
I said, “Why? Where are you eating these days? Not in that oily place?” “No, we have our own cook we have our everything, but the problem is the house is full of bhoots and we are all finished with that!”

191
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,280
So I said, “Who had asked you to suggest that? Can't you eat that food? So many thousands of boys are eating here.

192
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:14,260
You are Sahaja Yogis you can't eat that food? Your attention is on the oily food what is so special about yourselves that you can't eat?

193
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:23,820
I mean you should be able to eat even the stones. That’s what Sahaja Yoga is but you can’t eat the ordinary food that all so many thousands of boys are eating?

194
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,460
And you wanted to stay away - such importance of yourself, so go ahead!” And it was all done by satanic forces.

195
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:40,700
You should have thought once at least that, “Why are we wanting to go away from here that place? When where it is all organised, let us be here!” That is Sahaja.

196
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,820
That part also they didn’t understand — discrimination also of what is Sahaja what is asahaja?

197
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,000
Where are you Sahaja and where are you not, you should discriminate it. That point at least one should reach.

198
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,960
So the so called, the high, top class Sahaja Yogis fell down like that, and they felt very shy and bad. I said, “It’s all right, don't you worry.” But it’s a simple thing.

199
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:13,600
It's a lesson now. Because you can overcome [the] food problem but what about the bhoots? Why should you go in with somebody, a person who has just come to Sahaja Yoga, and you don't know what sort of person he is?

200
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:24,980
They said, “Mother, it's your Maya!” I said, “But what about you? You people were thinking that you are great and you are the greatest Sahaj Yogis ever born, and you are the topmost among all the worlds!

201
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,760
So don’t think like this.” And this is what happened. You see, so it plays on you, just to test you and it works on you.

202
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:40,020
So, ‘sahaja’ means whatever comes your way you take it, no doubt, but you do it yourself with positiveness. That is very necessary.

203
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:49,220
That doesn’t mean that you go on accepting everything ‘sahaja’ : “The bhoots coming onto me, I’m accepting, everything coming onto me I am accepting. That is not the way it is Sahaja, that’s the point.

204
00:25:49,220 --> 00:26:03,320
When we start doing like that, then actually ‘sahaja’ what you will get is bhoots, and what you will get is all the negativity, and also you’ll get all the sickness, illness, everything. You have to be careful.

205
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:10,020
So mentally you should be alert. Physically you should work it out.

206
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:23,440
And physically there is another point: is that you must look after your bodies, physically, [it’s] very much necessary, because this body is the temple of God. It is definitely now the temple.

207
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:32,520
It’s a shrine. See how beautiful a shrine you have got. And I love to reside in this place.

208
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:43,660
Let it be so beautiful that God should reside in that. Beautiful it is. Look after your body, look after your hair, look after yourself. If you treat yourself there’s no harm.

209
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:55,840
People might say that, “Why should I treat myself? I must take all the burdens on myself!” All these out of date ideas of sufferings are useless for Sahaj Yog. Nobody has to suffer.  You have to be very, very healthy people.

210
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,360
Like somebody said that, “Why is it that Ramkrishna Paramahansa did not cure himself?

211
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:11,600
Because he did not know how to cure himself, first of all. But Ramkrishna said, “I want to take all the burdens on my head.” You don't get sick if somebody who is sick you do not get sick.

212
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:24,520
But, the only thing is that, if you look after your body, you respect your body, then your body also respects you. You body understands! If you don’t care for your body, you neglect your body, then body also says, “All right I'll have my way!”

213
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:34,720
So you have to look after your body. You have to know how to keep it all right. I think we should really write it down, all the things that are to be done to look after your body.

214
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:50,500
That is very important, because in these modern times or modern society, of course, you have devised ways of comfort that you press here, then you get everything coming down, you press there and you get food inside your stomach and all that is there.

215
00:27:50,500 --> 00:28:00,360
Not everywhere this is! That is all comfort they call it but I call it lethargy, or can call it laziness. It is not going to give you good health.

216
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:13,760
Good health is possible only if you understand the balancing and have every understanding about how the body acts and what happens to body: small, small things like hot and cool, cold and hot. This is very important for Sahaj Yoga.

217
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:32,620
You see Sahaja Yogis have to be perfect, absolutely perfect. And you don’t have to do with the norms of the modern times that everybody should be thin and everybody should be absolutely a TB patient going down for some sort of beauty parade!

218
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:42,080
You should be all very healthy people and impressive. Whenever you sit there people should literally be frightened of you that, “From where these wrestlers have come?”

219
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:55,120
So this is the sign of attending to your health attending yourself and your mental health also.

220
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,680
And that’s why I say that you [should] be that you careful as to what you read and what you see and what you hear and how much attention you pay to it.

221
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,660
You see supposing now a person like David comes here: you pay too much attention to a man like that.

222
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:15,120
Everything is filled with that, the whole atmosphere is talking about it. Everybody is worried about it, it is all going on. It’s negative.

223
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:23,980
I think you talked more about David than about me at that time. Because I have also come, but David was there. But [this] sort of thing, it happens.

224
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:32,460
Because we are used to seeing a thing like a sensational thing coming up, you see. Like newspapers will always publish something sensational. We are used to a sensation.

225
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:44,640
So Mr. David was quite important. But just see how unimportant he was — he’s just disappeared. So if you had just neglected him, not bothered very much paying attention to him very much.

226
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:54,460
I hope Cooly is not too long with… You see, I don't want Cooly to be curing him and get into trouble. All right.

227
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,560
So the regular habits of sitting in the water and all that should be done.

228
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,380
Also regular habits about your mind: is not to read this. Just avoid! You don’t want to read any more of these things.

229
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:31,100
There are so many beautiful books you can read. If you have to read and if you are used to it, you can read beautiful books.

230
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:38,580
I have told you so many of them are there. You can read The Bible and see for yourself that it is all Sahaja, every word.

231
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,940
You can find out so many quotations and so many things which can help us to tell these Christians, otherwise they are not going to listen to this,

232
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,840
they are such conformed sort of things, that you have to tell something from The Bible.

233
00:30:49,840 --> 00:31:00,040
You can read Koran, you can read other books like Khalil Gibran and things, which are supporting you, which are also helping you which are giving you ideas.

234
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:07,480
Are you all right? You sure?  I think better put your left hand towards me and right hand outside.
