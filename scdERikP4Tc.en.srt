1
00:18:51,100 --> 00:19:00,680
Today we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

2
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:10,180
You all know the story of His birth and I need not repeat it.

3
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:22,890
But, as He was created by the Mother only, by Adi Shakti,

4
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,470
in the same way you are all created after Him.

5
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,270
So, you are on the path of Shri Ganesha already.

6
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,850
Your eyes sparkle the same way His eyes sparkle.

7
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,430
You all have the beautiful glow on your face as He had.

8
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,600
Whether you are small, big or old makes no difference.

9
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:16,470
All the beauty comes to us through the glow of Shri Ganesha.

10
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,810
If He's satisfied, then we don't have to worry

11
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,770
about any other deities,

12
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,980
because the power of all the deities is Shri Ganesha.

13
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,520
He's like a vice-chancellor sitting on every chakra.

14
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,350
Unless and until He signs, Kundalini cannot cross through,

15
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:49,230
because Kundalini’s the Gauri and is the Virgin Mother of Shri Ganesh.

16
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,600
Now we have to understand that we are here

17
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,020
in the Western society where so much has gone wrong

18
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,980
because we never bother to look after Shri Ganesha.

19
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,730
Christ came and His message spread all over the world.

20
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:26,980
He talked of things which are not practised by Christians, not at all.

21
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,140
Because whatever they started is not based on truth.

22
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,730
Truth is that Shri Ganesha took birth as Christ.

23
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,480
If that is the truth, then they have to understand

24
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,180
in the light of Shri Ganesha this great incarnation of Christ.

25
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:11,520
That is, He has told people that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

26
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,430
Actually, for a saint, He doesn’t know what is an adulterous eyes,

27
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,020
because He just sees. He just sees.

28
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,390
As Shri Gyaneshwara’s beautifully said, NIRANJANABANI

29
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
to see without any reaction, just to see.

30
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:49,310
That is the quality of innocence, which was brought to light by Christ,

31
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,980
our Lord, but we did not imbibe anyone of these qualities.

32
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,480
Now supposing you are worshipping today Shri Ganesh.

33
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,600
So why are you worshipping Shri Ganesha?

34
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,350
You’re worshipping because your Ganesha must be awakened,

35
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,770
that you should have the qualities of Shri Ganesha within you,

36
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,060
that you should feel that innocence in your eyes.

37
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,520
Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

38
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,980
If you are sitting here and worshipping Shri Ganesha

39
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,560
and you are not trying to put your attention to your ascent

40
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,390
as Shri Ganesh, then it is useless.

41
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:01,430
And then He is an eternal child. He doesn't have ego,

42
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,230
He doesn't have any conditionings. So, He’s an eternal child.

43
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,270
We have to become eternal children of our Mother.

44
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:22,350
To get to that state, what do we have to do is simple,

45
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,730
that o to raise our Kundalini, fix it up,

46
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,470
o to do meditation and o keep our attention inside,

47
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,520
more, and o not to react.

48
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,020
Now, to say not to react means just to watch.

49
00:24:50,810 --> 00:25:01,230
And when you watch without thinking about it, then the truth,

50
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,350
which is really poetry, comes out.

51
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,850
That's why a poet sees much more than an ordinary person can see.

52
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:24,310
The inner’s beauty just starts penetrating your vision

53
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,560
and you start seeing it.

54
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,930
So, you have seen children, whatever may be their origin,

55
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,140
from whatever country they might be coming, whether it is Japan

56
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,480
or whether it is England, India, Australia, anywhere,

57
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,850
see the children are normally very beautiful.

58
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:00,140
Once I went to Japan and there was a shrine they wanted Me to see,

59
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:09,730
so I saw some ladies coming down - three, four ladies.

60
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,060
They’re western ladies. They said, “Don’t go. Don’t go.

61
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,980
There are some children - horrible.”

62
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,980
I said, “Why?”

63
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
“They call you witch. They called us all,

64
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,430
“Witches, witches, witches”, Japanese children.”

65
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,140
I said, “How do you know? They must be saying in Japanese.”

66
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,850
“No, we asked the meaning,

67
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,850
so they told us it means witches.

68
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,980
We look like witches to them, so better not go.”

69
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,270
I said, “It’s all right. Let Me go.” And when I went up,

70
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,230
they all came running, clung to Me, kissed Me, this thing.

71
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,470
They wouldn’t allow Me to go to the shrine

72
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,430
and then they walked all the way to the shrine, they came back.

73
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,020
I didn’t know their language or anything. So sweet.

74
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,310
Kissing My sari, kissing My hand, so sweet they were.

75
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,930
And I was surprised that how is it they call the other ladies

76
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,980
as witches and to Us, to Me, and My daughters were also with us.

77
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,180
And My daughters are very fond of children.

78
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,430
So then they said, “You see, why to go to the shrine?

79
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,810
We’ll play with the children.”

80
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,640
I said, „Let’s go to the shrine, after all.“

81
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,430
So when we went up, these children also came with us

82
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,850
and walked down. And their mothers were so surprised, you see,

83
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,600
they said normally to all the foreigners,

84
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:32,600
to all the foreigners they say „witches“ or even to men

85
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,730
they say they are devils. „Devils are coming.“

86
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,180
Because Japanese are short people, you see,

87
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,020
and the size of our Western people are quite big

88
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,140
and perhaps maybe that is the reason, whatever it is

89
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,230
or maybe something else, I don’t know.

90
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,230
And they wouldn’t, I mean, even talk to them.

91
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,520
They all ran away, calling them, „Witches, witches“,

92
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:01,930
from the windows and from every corner. Then I realized, you see,

93
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,980
these small, little children, their Ganesha is awakened in them.

94
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,640
Everybody's Ganesha is awakened when you are born.

95
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,730
All the animals have their Ganesha intact with them,

96
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,930
specially the birds. We never think how birds,

97
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,390
all the way from Siberia go to Australia.

98
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,230
What direction comes to them, from where?

99
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,850
They have got a magnet within themselves. That is Shri Ganesh.

100
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,230
Magnet is Shri Ganesha.

101
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:46,890
So, this magnet, which is within us can attract innocent people

102
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,640
and repel cunning, horrible

103
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,100
as they call witch and devils and all those.

104
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,850
So this magnet has both the qualities,

105
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,350
that it repels those who are not all right

106
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,350
and it attracts those who are innocent.

107
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,350
And that is why in Sahaja Yoga we find that we cannot tolerate

108
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,980
some people somehow or other, we try, we try, we try.

109
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,770
But somehow or other it’s a bit difficult, you know.

110
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,480
They don’t know what is the reason. The reason is Ganesha.

111
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,140
Now, in the Western society, as you know,

112
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,270
not that they’ve not paid any attention to their Ganesha quality,

113
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,020
but they have talked too much about the perversion of Shri Ganesha.

114
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,100
They talk on the television, they talk here, there, in every way.

115
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
The children see it and so many small, little children are suffering

116
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,310
from Shri Ganesh problem, very small children.

117
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:08,180
How do they get into these problems is because of the atmosphere is full of it.

118
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,520
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also we have some people

119
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,890
who just stick on hypocritically and they have Ganesha problem.

120
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,810
And there are some who support. This fellow can say,

121
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,140
„Oh, I was such a sick man, I had no wife

122
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,850
or I’ve had no love from my parents“ or anything

123
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,390
and others start supporting.

124
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,430
This kind of sympathy is very dangerous, is extremely dangerous.

125
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,390
First of all, this sympathy ruins that person

126
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,680
who cannot get over his problems and gradually

127
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,770
you also pick up these problems. Instead of helping him,

128
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,980
that you do the meditation of Ganesha,

129
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,560
you just sit on the Mother Earth, say „Atharva Sheersha“,

130
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,560
use the candle. Your problem will go away. Instead of that,

131
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,980
they start sympathizing. This is not sympathy.

132
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,310
It’s sym-pathy. „Sym“ means „to share“, „Pathy“ means „pathos.“

133
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,520
So you share all the problems of that person yourself.

134
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,100
So, never support a wrong thing.

135
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,560
If you really love that person, you care for that person,

136
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,430
you have to tell that person, "This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong."

137
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,350
Moreover, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people of seventy years

138
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,600
also want to get married. I can’t understand, you know.

139
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,640
After all, loneliness is not possible in Sahaja Yoga,

140
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,730
you have so many Sahaja Yogis. Where is the loneliness?

141
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,140
I never feel lonely. I would love to be sometimes.

142
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,770
If you are not with Me, My family is with Me.

143
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:15,140
I’m never alone and I’m never alone when I’m alone, really.

144
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,100
I enjoy Myself best when I’m alone

145
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,560
because I have time to reflect back as to what we have achieved,

146
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,180
as to how these moments were beautiful moments of meeting you all,

147
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,560
all those beautiful places I visited with you, all the enjoyments.

148
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,390
So all such people who are explaining

149
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,810
their problems of Mooladhara have to know one thing,

150
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,140
that this is a sure certificate for them

151
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,560
to go to hell, absolutely.

152
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,560
Because either from the Mooladhara, you know,

153
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,600
all kinds of diseases come in which are incurable,

154
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:10,470
according to the doctor. Say, you take multiple sclerosis.

155
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,430
From multiple sclerosis through all the disabilities of the muscles,

156
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:24,470
even cancers could be started by Mooladhara problem.

157
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,230
Why is it so much cancer in the Western countries

158
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:36,390
than in any other countries? Everybody has an explanation.

159
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,560
Somebody said there are not so many doctors of cancer,

160
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,810
that’s why there are. It’s not so.

161
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,100
Now, you see the disease of schizophrenia

162
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,350
also can come from Mooladhara problem.

163
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,100
Of course, you know AIDS is nothing but Mooladhara problem.

164
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,850
But still, if you want to make a martyrdom out of that, that

165
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,390
„We are AIDS soldiers walking to our death,“

166
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,230
then what can you do to such stupid people?

167
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,180
And stupidity comes also from Mooladhara,

168
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,020
because He is the giver of wisdom.

169
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,020
How do you get the wisdom?

170
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,890
Only by awakening your Shri Ganesh. He is the giver of wisdom.

171
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:50,350
Now, all kinds of people do stupidities, unbelievable - unbelievable.

172
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,560
Like in India recently I asked them for bigger bangles,

173
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,770
for the ladies have bigger hands here and they came back

174
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,850
to say that these days all big bangles are going to America.

175
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,310
So why?

176
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,020
Because the men have decided to wear bangles in America.

177
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,020
Now in India, if you give one bangle to any man,

178
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,390
means an insult to him that „You are not a man.“

179
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,350
All such stupidities, hundred and one, I tell you,

180
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,850
you see all over the world now because have come out of it.

181
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,730
All kinds of things come because their Mooladhara is not all right.

182
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:48,770
In India now, for example, we all wear saris. Nobody knows.

183
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,680
I mean, logically also we should wear saris

184
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,140
because saris are made by villagers and they earn out of it

185
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,810
and that’s how we support this thing. Culturally,

186
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:04,310
we like it also because it suggests we are shy women,

187
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,310
we don’t want to expose our body too much and thirdly,

188
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,520
it’s very good for the mothers,

189
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,270
that mothers can nurse the children and look after them.

190
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:25,480
So, it has various aspects, but nobody thinks the logic of it.

191
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,640
They think it’s very practical and it has been there for traditions.

192
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,520
Now, supposing you say, „All right, come along,

193
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,600
give up your saris and wear something else,“

194
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,470
they’ll say, „Now, tell us another. No, no. Nothing doing.“

195
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:49,850
Nobody would accept it. Nobody would accept it, because they think

196
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,640
that saris are more gracious, they make you look like a woman.

197
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,390
There’s so much beautiful dress

198
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,930
and it does give chance for the artist to express themselves.

199
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,180
But this is only some intellectuals might be thinking,

200
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,230
but normally in the villages, if you tell them that you change over,

201
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,180
they say, „No.“ So nothing like a fashion can work out.

202
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,470
Nothing like a fashion can work out

203
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,020
because traditionally now they have reached certain stage of wisdom,

204
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,310
„Now, this is the best suited for us.“

205
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,850
So they won’t accept any nonsense.

206
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,680
Ha, if it is something sensible, which is never so,

207
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,810
I would say, from the West, they may.

208
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,600
But because the Western people have lost their wisdom,

209
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,270
there is nothing that comes sensible to India, nothing.

210
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,310
And whatever sensible they have, that is also going out.

211
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,770
Yesterday you heard such beautiful waltz.

212
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,060
I mean who plays these days waltz?

213
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,850
Thousands will gather at some sort of a noisy pop, hard music,

214
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,060
which can penetrate into your ears and can make you deaf.

215
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,100
There’s no wisdom in all these things.

216
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,810
They want all the time some sort of a sensation.

217
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,060
I was told people come here for skiing.

218
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,560
Now some I saw people jumping with a parachute.

219
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,390
Ask an Indian. He’ll say, „You better do it.

220
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,230
I’m not here to break my legs.“

221
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,980
That he understands the wisdom that

222
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,560
„My body is more important than anything else.

223
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,350
What is this sensation for?“

224
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,850
The skiing, so many people have seen, they’ve lost their kidneys.

225
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,470
They have lost their legs. They’ll have artificial legs for skiing.

226
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:50,850
This sensation comes as a great attraction for people

227
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:57,140
who have no wisdom. It doesn't appeal to the wisdom.

228
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:06,180
So, the people who are wise don’t take to stupid things.

229
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:16,430
Though Shri Ganesha is the child, but He is the giver of wisdom.

230
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,230
So we can say our children are the giver of wisdom

231
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,810
if we keep them on the line of wisdom.

232
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,770
You listen to them, how they talk, how wisely they talk.

233
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,600
Sometimes they have a conference with Me

234
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,470
and they tell Me all about you people, what you are up to

235
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,100
and they take Me into confidence completely and say that

236
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,810
„Don’t tell uncle or auntie, but we’ll tell You this.“

237
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,310
And small, small things they say, that „auntie was wearing the sari

238
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,350
You gave her and then, you know, she put it on the ground.“

239
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,480
All little, little things they know, so sweet they are.

240
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,560
See yesterday how they came rushing and kissed Me so sweet,

241
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,680
without them the world would have been like a desert without any flowers, you know.

242
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,520
So, Shri Ganesha has created you.

243
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,430
Because of Him, you were born.

244
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,230
He’s the one who looked after you when you were in the womb of the mother.

245
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:32,310
He's the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time.

246
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,520
He’s the one who has looked after your nourishment, everything.

247
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,890
He's the one who has looked after your development of the fetus,

248
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,640
of the brain and everything.

249
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,390
All is done that by this great personality, Shri Ganesh.

250
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,600
How much we owe to Him. Apart from that,

251
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,980
He gives us the basic wisdom. I mean, a villager,

252
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,470
supposing you talk to a villager who is not exposed

253
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,020
to all these non-sensical sensations, you’ll find him

254
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,850
extremely practical and wise.

255
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:15,680
There’s a story that one villager was travelling by train with other boys

256
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,270
who were very flamboyant and thinking that they were very smart.

257
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,850
So, they were trying to tease the man.

258
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,850
So, a boy asked a question to him.

259
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:37,350
„Now, if the butter is selling for one pound, for a quarter of a pound,

260
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:44,180
what will be the price of the egg in the next station?“

261
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,600
He looked at him. He said, „All right, you tell me what.

262
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,850
Then, you cannot tell the price of the egg,

263
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:06,560
then can you tell me the price, can you tell me my age?“

264
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,980
He looked at him. He said, „You must be twenty-two.“

265
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,060
He said. „How do you know?“

266
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,810
He said, „I have a brother who is eleven years and he is half mad,

267
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,140
but you are full mad.“

268
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,140
So, an ordinary villager answered this smart fellow

269
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,980
and the smart fellow didn’t know where to go.

270
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:54,730
So, all this smartness and cleverness finishes off

271
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,980
when it comes to innocence.

272
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:06,390
Now, many people have a feeling also that we have lost our innocence.

273
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:11,100
That is something, an eternal quality you have got.

274
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,310
You never lose your innocence.

275
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:19,100
Maybe, as clouds can cover the whole sky,

276
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,680
maybe your ego and conditionings and your mistakes

277
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:28,100
might have covered it, but it is always there, always there.

278
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:34,480
Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner

279
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,770
that you respect your innocence.

280
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,680
Not to feel shy about your innocence, never.

281
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,060
Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence

282
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:59,020
will definitely give you that wisdom by which

283
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,520
you can solve all the problems without any difficulty.

284
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,600
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

285
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,850
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

286
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,480
She created Him from the Aumkara.

287
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,230
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

288
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:36,730
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

289
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:43,890
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

290
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:57,640
which have light in it. They have all the causals of all the elements,

291
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,680
only on the right side.

292
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:07,890
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

293
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,560
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

294
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:23,180
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

295
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:30,310
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

296
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:39,810
but if anything is done against the Mother, then He goes all wild.

297
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:47,560
Then He punishes and that is how the divine justice is brought to people.

298
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,470
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

299
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,060
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

300
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,270
the protocol of the Mother.

301
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,390
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

302
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,560
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

303
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,390
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

304
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:29,100
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

305
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,560
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

306
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:44,230
For many people are still in the West anxious to copy other people,

307
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,640
fall back into the wrong ideas,

308
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:56,930
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

309
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Thank God you all have come out of it

310
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,470
and when you see the hell into which the Western society has fallen,

311
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:13,060
you try to understand and enjoy that you are at a different state altogether.

312
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,980
But still, among you there will be some who will be dangling.

313
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,020
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

314
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,560
and go also with them.

315
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,350
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

316
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,480
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

317
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,520
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

318
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,980
So you are here as saviours and you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

319
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,980
which is to be used. So today's Puja

320
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,770
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

321
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:52,980
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

322
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,350
that You manifest within ourselves.

323
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,890
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

324
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,600
and all these wrong ideas we have

325
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,680
or all the wrong life we have had,

326
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:16,230
should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight

327
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,060
of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.”

328
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,730
Let us manifest these qualities.

329
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,430
This is what is to be asked.

330
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,270
Today is a great day. I’m very happy we are in Austria,

331
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,140
which I call is the country of divine weapons.

332
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,980
It’s a very wonderful country, as I told you before

333
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,390
that there is no fundamentalism here.

334
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,390
It’s very surprising, but I have discovered that in Austria

335
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,350
there have been people from all over the world

336
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,810
and they have been married here, it’s a small country,

337
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,230
so they all kept together. It’s a very nice place,

338
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,980
specially this place where we are.

339
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,310
I heard that it’s called as the holy land of Tyrol.

340
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,680
And we also saw lots of grace falling down with our eyes.

341
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,270
Everybody could see them, the grace coming down.

342
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,230
There was no rain, but you could see the grace.

343
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,470
Moreover, yesterday, the villagers remarked that this river overflows.

344
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:31,140
The whole glacier comes down and this river overflows,

345
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,680
but it did not. It kept to its maryadas.

346
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,390
They are quite surprised how it has happened

347
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,430
that it kept to its maryadas.

348
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:49,060
This is one thing and the second thing is they said

349
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:57,230
that they have never heard such great, absolutely volcanic,

350
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,180
roaring of the clouds, they’ve never heard such reports before

351
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,100
and it was really remarkable it rained so heavily

352
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,930
everything happened and we are all right.

353
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,100
Only in the central path of Sushumna it cleared out.

354
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,390
Maybe because I had to walk through that, so it cleared out that part.

355
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,480
But on the whole, all our programs went off very well

356
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,020
and we all enjoyed the last night’s program

357
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,470
and the musician also lost all count of time,

358
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,470
he played for four hours on his own.

359
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,730
I thought he’d just play one raga.

360
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,480
He went on and he wanted to play more, but then,

361
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,100
thank God, he thought of the puja perhaps and he stopped it.

362
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:49,270
So, let us try to be innocent within our self.

363
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,980
Be proud that we are innocent.

364
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,890
We need not be smart people.

365
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,560
Smartness is your mental attitude

366
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:03,600
and innocence is your innate quality

367
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,730
which is connected with this all-pervading power.

368
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,480
So, may God bless you all!

369
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,810
At least during the Puja there should not be

370
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,020
any movements outside or nearby.

371
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,470
If the children are sitting, well and good,

372
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,520
otherwise you can go out. But you shouldn’t disturb others

373
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,480
because their attention goes to you.

374
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,890
So, all those who are having any movements,

375
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,100
all of you also should come and sit with your children.

376
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,850
Why can’t your children sit down?

377
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,850
They will sit, bring them in.

378
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,310
Or if they are not sitting you go behind the curtain,

379
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,480
because they get disturbed, you see, there are Sahaja Yogis still

380
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,600
who are getting disturbed very easily

381
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,640
with the slightest movement here and there.

382
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,270
So, the first thing is to open your heart for Shri Ganesha.

383
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,230
As you see a child, how your heart opens.

384
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,980
In the same way, please open your hearts.

385
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,230
All right …

386
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,270
Ah, see, one thing is that He has got a hunter in His hand

387
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:41,480
and if you remember Christ used a hunter to hit all the people,

388
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,390
who were selling goods near the temple.

389
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,560
He could have used any other weapon, but He used a hunter.
