1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:28,199
I am here to talk to you about a higher life
than what we know of, about a power that pervades,

2
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:50,719
permeates, every other power; and about the
world which is called as the world of bliss

3
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,400
and joy.

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,940
You must have heard about all these words
before also.

5
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:13,670
But I am here to tell you about the instrument
that resides within us, all nicely planted

6
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:25,380
within our being, as clear as you see here
in the picture, which is a living instrument,

7
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:39,350
which you can also see pulsating actually
with your own eyes when the Kundalini, this

8
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:47,229
coiled energy, rises.

9
00:01:47,229 --> 00:02:01,329
We have already been blessed to have this
ascent into our own being, the breakthrough

10
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:11,330
into the unconscious, to enter into another
new dimension all together in our awareness

11
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:23,210
by which we really can find out answers to
all your absolute questions.

12
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:33,030
So far, in the ancient India, we had three
types of movements.

13
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,420
I don’t know if you are aware of all of
them, but we had three types.

14
00:02:37,420 --> 00:03:03,030
And the reflections of that were manifesting
in that country, also in other countries.

15
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:15,500
Even in England we have had people who have
been very busy finding out the answers to

16
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,960
many fundamental questions, absolute questions.

17
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,880
So the seeking has been everywhere in the
whole world.

18
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:36,210
But, as I have told you before, India was
perhaps the best country, because of its climatic

19
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:56,069
conditions, and because there was a lot of
scope for people to go into secluded places

20
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:08,360
to find out the answer to their seeking.

21
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:18,820
Today I would like to tell you the three methods,
or three ways, we have been seeking and the

22
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,220
results of that.

23
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:36,280
The first one is on the left-hand side: is
the path by which 

24
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,470
they had devotion to God, what they call the
bhakti.

25
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,090
They sang praise of God without seeking Him.

26
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,660
They called Him, they asked His help.

27
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:05,210
In the beginning they thought that the greatest
challenge they have is from the elements;

28
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,520
so they tried to overpower the elements.

29
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:24,370
And in that overpowering of elements the movement
was on the right-hand side, in which they

30
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:33,270
used many methods by which they could excite
or could innovate, as they call it, the deities

31
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:42,590
or the subtle principles of the elements.

32
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,830
The first one was that of the devotees and
the second one that of the people who were

33
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:57,200
trying to find out the way to master the elements.

34
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:13,600
The third one was in the centre and there
were two types of people who searched.

35
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:23,080
I would say the one who searched, the another
which 

36
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:34,240
incarnated on this Earth to help, and this
was the evolutionary path of our ascent.

37
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:47,620
The evolutionary path of our ascent came into
light, you will be amazed, much later than

38
00:06:47,620 --> 00:07:02,960
Krishna Himself came on this Earth, even after
Christ, people started talking about the methods

39
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,460
of evolution within us.

40
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,100
So we should have no confusion about these
three methods.

41
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:24,090
Because of the bhakti of people, because of
the asking of the people, the different aspects

42
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,360
of God descended on this Earth as incarnations.

43
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,980
Whether all this I say is true or not, you
need not believe, because I am putting a hypothesis

44
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,250
before you.

45
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,150
And then later on you can find out if it is
true or not.

46
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:55,259
You have to only keep your mind open like
a scientist to know about it.

47
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:04,560
Now the middle path of evolution is the one
that we are going to discuss here.

48
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:18,570
The one that deals with the mastering of the
nature, is the one they used in the Vedas

49
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:29,389
where they did not mention even the deities,
they did not mention anything about God Almighty,

50
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:42,500
but only talked of the Brahma Tattwa, the
one principle by which all the five elements

51
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,040
are governed.

52
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:58,930
And all those mantras and slokas, to excite
the elements, were recited just to get the

53
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:06,880
benediction of these elements as well as the
control over them.

54
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:19,250
So once upon a time, say, twelve thousand
years back, in India, we had pilotless bombs.

55
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,370
We had instruments that could work out much
better than your missiles.

56
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:34,680
They achieved it through this method of Right
Side innovation.

57
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,930
When I went to Colombia I was so surprised
that they also used the Right Side methods.

58
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:51,110
For that they used to also take a kind of
an intoxicant which we call ‘somras’ in

59
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,110
India.

60
00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:01,160
It was an intoxicant which would not give
you a habit but would take you to a state

61
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,899
where you could understand that there is beyond
something; you can say something like LSD

62
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,450
maybe.

63
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:18,490
But this LSD that you take is very different
from the one they used.

64
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:25,880
It was, I should say, a holy thing which had
something to do with God; because whatever

65
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:40,330
in India they tried to search, they kept the
centrifugal force acting on them, which was

66
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,320
the assumption that there is God.

67
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
So they did not deviate too much from the
Right Side.

68
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,350
They did not go too far.

69
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:00,529
As a result of that search, science came to
us.

70
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:06,250
It came through the unconscious, all the discoveries.

71
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:14,930
But our awareness – after all this world
is one whole – our awareness was tuned up

72
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,300
to a point where we could understand science.

73
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:33,779
As a result of that kind of innovation they
mastered a lot of things and they organised

74
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,830
many wars as we are doing nowadays.

75
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:45,300
And in those wars there are descriptions of
aeroplanes and all kinds of ayudha they call

76
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:54,560
it weapons, which are fantastic.

77
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,930
But there was another movement going on, on
the left-hand side where people did not care

78
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,420
for all these things.

79
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,250
This was meant for the kshatriyas, the kings,
who were very ambitious and wanted to overpower

80
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,269
the whole world.

81
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:17,670
But the Left Side gentry, I would say, the
people who were dedicated to God, who always

82
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:33,110
asked for the help of God, were busy organizing
dedications and what we call worships, pujas,

83
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:40,269
according to their own understanding.

84
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:58,740
But the central path was looked after by two
forces: The first one those who were the seekers

85
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,180
under some gurus, who were realised souls
of a very high level.

86
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:17,220
And the other were the incarnations who came
on this Earth to protect, to save, the devotees

87
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,269
of God.

88
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:30,830
This movement was very secretive in the beginning,
extremely secretive.

89
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:39,850
Only one or two people they would employ to
this kind of work from the whole society.

90
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:49,860
In one generation you could hardly find five
or six people doing this work of evolving

91
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,410
people into new awareness.

92
00:13:51,410 --> 00:14:02,220
This I am telling you before the time even
Vedas were written.

93
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:11,740
Because the incarnations that were to come,
who had not established, were kept as a very

94
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,610
guarded secret.

95
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,709
The reason was that if they had disclosed
that these are the incarnations who are going

96
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:28,660
to come then the negative forces, which were
trying to pull down the evolution, would organise

97
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:40,070
a method by which they would destroy these
incarnations before their coming.

98
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:49,700
But still, as you can see in the life of Christ,
that coming of Christ was declared much before

99
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,649
Christ came in by the prophets who made prophecies.

100
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:02,890
All these prophets belong to the category
of the Gurus I am talking about.

101
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,810
So all over the world three types of movements
were on.

102
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:13,680
For example the scientists on the right-hand
side, we can say, and the left-hand side are

103
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,769
the devotees of God who sing the praise of
God.

104
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:27,411
And in the centre there were people like Moses,
like Abraham, who came on this Earth just

105
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:36,399
to prophecies, just to protect the devotees
of God.

106
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:48,279
Now this middle movement of evolution today
has reached its peak, because all the incarnations

107
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,250
have arrived now and have done their job within
you.

108
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:59,880
They have occupied their position within you,
in your awareness, on these different centres.

109
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:17,320
So the first centre that we have here which
is established in the carbon atom.

110
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,410
Carbon has got four hands in the same way
this centre has also got four hands.

111
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:29,760
You can see the four sides of this centre.

112
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,209
That means up to the matter stage it is even
below that.

113
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,510
Then the carbon started the living.

114
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:51,420
This carbon atom actually ignited the living
process in the matter.

115
00:16:51,420 --> 00:17:00,829
Though the time taken for this, since the
time the Earth seceded from the sun, is very,

116
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:02,440
very short.

117
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:11,010
I mean nobody can explain why and how it could
happen: some Juggler could only do that job.

118
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:24,549
So this carbon atom started the triggering
of living beings.

119
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:39,620
Afterwards, we can say that the incarnation
of the centre, this green coloured centre,

120
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:55,990
which we call as the Nabhi Chakra – the
incarnations started on this point, one after

121
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:04,350
another taking different forms of living animals
in the evolution.

122
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,620
Like first the fish.

123
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,110
It came as a fish.

124
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,720
They say when Noah was having a bad time with
the deluge this fish helped him.

125
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,900
They came as an incarnation, that aspect of
God which we call as evolutionary.

126
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,760
That came as a fish on this Earth and then
it came as quadruped.

127
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,380
Then it came as a short man.

128
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:43,230
It came as a strong man and on and on and
on like that till we reached a stage where

129
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,640
the top one you can see, over here.

130
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,410
This is the stage where Shri Ram, who came
eight-thousand years back.

131
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:56,690
This was established within us like a milestone.

132
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,820
They were the leaders of our evolution.

133
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,030
They led us into evolution as well as they
left a mark for us there and they exist within

134
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,400
us in that path.

135
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:17,990
So on the right side of the centre, this is
called as the Heart Chakra, as you can call

136
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:23,600
it Cardiac Chakra or we call it as Hridya
Chakra in Sanskrit language.

137
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,070
On the right-hand side appeared Shri Ram.

138
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:35,280
Now why did He appear, Shri Ram, on the right-hand
side, because He was to forget about His incarnation.

139
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,750
He was to forget that, in essence, He is the
evolutionary aspect of God which is Shri Vishnu,

140
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,210
who resides in the centre here, because He
was somewhere in different forms.

141
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,910
So He was to forget about it.

142
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,049
He had to behave just like a human being so
that no human being suspects Him to be an

143
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,049
incarnation.

144
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:06,360
He became a king, a benevolent king, an ideal
king, with all the limitations of a king and

145
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,059
the beauty of a king.

146
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:14,169
And that’s how this incarnation came on
this Earth about eight-thousand years back.

147
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:25,750
At the same time when this centre which is
the we call it as Void, but you can call it

148
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:38,280
as the whole universe, you can say; this was
full of people who were negative and were

149
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,770
trying to destroy the devotees of God.

150
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:52,751
Then the Primordial Power which is called
as the Adishakti, the primordial Mother, She

151
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:58,200
came at that centre, much earlier than Rama.

152
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:07,059
She came there about twelve-thousand years
back to protect these devotees, from twelve

153
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,440
thousand years, in one thousand incarnations.

154
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,820
Of course, I think there have been much more
but one thousand are the main incarnations

155
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:25,780
which came on this Earth as Primordial Mother,
they came to protect Her children, Her devotees.

156
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:40,160
Now the topmost one, not the topmost but the
second one, this centre is the centre where

157
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:48,840
the Vishnu Tattwa, or the evolutionary aspect
of the God, completely manifested.

158
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:57,929
The complete manifestation of this principle
took place, and that is the principle of Shri

159
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:58,929
Krishna.

160
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:07,400
So Shri Krishna is regarded as the complete
manifestation of this evolutionary process.

161
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,549
But God Almighty as we know Him is everything.

162
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:17,010
He is not only the evolutionary principle,
He’s also the existence on the left-hand

163
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:23,919
side and He’s also the Creator on the right-hand
side.

164
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:31,080
But much before all this started another state
of awareness was there.

165
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,970
In that state of awareness this second centre
that you see here is the Creator’s.

166
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:50,039
He created, through His powers, all the universe,
through all the elements; then this Earth.

167
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:57,160
And on this Earth the cycle of life started.

168
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,840
All these centres are within us.

169
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:16,970
Now last of all, about two thousand years
back, came the greatest incarnation of Christ.

170
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,559
He was the son of God, the innocence.

171
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,020
And He came on this Earth.

172
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:32,030
At this point where you see this red mark,
behind, in the brain.

173
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:40,679
Between the pituitary and the pineal there’s
a very subtle centre, He came there: for us

174
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:51,570
to ascend, to us give the knowledge of the
eternal life, to give the knowledge that whatever

175
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:58,039
you see on this Earth is not the permanent
thing, there’s something beyond.

176
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:04,630
And in His resurrection He showed us how we
all can be resurrected.

177
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:17,750
This was the gate into the limbic area, what
we call as the Sahasrara, because it has got

178
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,010
one thousand petals.

179
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:28,980
Now these petals, as they look like this lotus,
it is actually like that within us, but in

180
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,730
a sleeping state.

181
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,559
You can see a candle.

182
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,919
Now when the wick is there, you don’t see
this form of the wick.

183
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,350
Only when it is enlightened you see them in
that form.

184
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:50,780
Now when you put one thousand like that they
all put together look like a lotus.

185
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,600
But when it is not enlightened, you only say
there are one thousand nerves but when these

186
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,480
nerves are enlightened, you can see the light
which is in different colours.

187
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:15,419
So today we are here to know that, within
us, all these incarnations exist, and the

188
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:24,809
force that really brought forth, really manifested
– who lived like human beings, and worked

189
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:34,690
like gurus – that force which existed in
this area, which created religion within us.

190
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,460
Religion as we understand, organised religion,
is not the religion.

191
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,770
But the religion means your sustaining power.

192
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:51,010
You are a human being because there are ten
sustaining powers within you.

193
00:25:51,010 --> 00:26:00,600
So they came to sustain us and to give us
full idea about these ten powers and to establish

194
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,490
us in our religion as a human being.

195
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:14,539
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked
out the sustain and helped us.

196
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:22,950
And this is one of the greatest forces we
have got, which resides within us.

197
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,760
And whatever they have said has a very great
meaning.

198
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:35,940
Actually we should say the main Gurus are
ten, but there are many other gurus.

199
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:46,280
And these ten Gurus could be described as
Raja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and in modern

200
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:53,620
times you can say Mohammed Sahib and even
up to Shirdi Sainath in Shirdi that force

201
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,120
came in for a short time, and then He disappeared.

202
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,860
Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there
and He died.

203
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:11,370
Also if you know Nanaka, He was also the same
force, the same Primordial Master, who was

204
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,130
born on this Earth.

205
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:21,490
Now this is not the time to tell about individual
people, but I think one day I will talk to

206
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,029
you only on this subject of the Gurus.

207
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:35,429
So these Gurus first started under the Primordial
Master Himself, who was called as Dattatreya.

208
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:45,870
And this Dattatreya is the one who is comprising
all these forces: the existence force and

209
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,600
the evolutionary force and the creative force,
all of them, in its innocence.

210
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,200
I don’t know if you understand it, but there’s
a story about them, that there are three deities

211
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,720
which belong to these three forces.

212
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,630
The left one is Shiva’s force, then the
right one is Brahmadeva’s force and the

213
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,980
centre one is Vishnu’s force.

214
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:22,300
So they say that all these three Gods felt
that the wife of Dattatreya was a great, devoted

215
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
woman.

216
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,779
And she, with her powers could curse anyone
she feels like.

217
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:37,890
So they wanted to take her test and wanted
to find out how far she was a devoted wife,

218
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:44,710
so they went to her and they told her that:
“We want some alms."

219
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,720
And in India, it is regarded as a great honour
to be able to give somebody alms who come

220
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
to your house.

221
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,900
And three saints, they were dressed up saints,
they came to the door.

222
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,250
So when they asked for alms, she said, “All
right, I will get you some alms."

223
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,700
They said, “No, we’ll come inside the
house, and you have to become completely naked

224
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,799
and then give us the alms."

225
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,980
Because to become naked before a man, you
lose all your powers as a devoted wife, as

226
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
a sati.

227
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,460
She said, “All right, if you say so, I will
do it."

228
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,740
And she started taking out her clothes.

229
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,900
As soon as she touched her clothes they became
small children, absolutely small children,

230
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,440
and she took out her clothes and gave them
the alms.

231
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,909
So these three small children put together
make the Dattatreya, is the Guru, is the one

232
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:44,809
who is innocent like a child, innocent like
a child, who has no sense of sex.

233
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:50,910
So we come to a conclusion a guru who has
interest in women, a guru who has interest

234
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,780
in sex, is not a guru but is anti-guru.

235
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:06,279
Dattatreya is the innocence of all these three
powers and this Guru was the one who then

236
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,919
had a big tradition of gurus.

237
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:15,740
In the same tradition we had many gurus in
our country and specially in the area near

238
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,830
Bombay, which is called as Maharastra.

239
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:23,240
They came as Nath, they were called as Nath.

240
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,950
So the first one was Adi Nath, then Dattatreya,
then Macchindernath, then Gorakhnath, like

241
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,299
that a tradition of these gurus came.

242
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:38,510
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded
secret, it was a gupta vidya, is absolutely

243
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,450
guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kundalini.

244
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,010
They never talked about it; they never told
about it, because they thought that, “Just

245
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:53,340
now let us experiment with it fully and then
we will give some idea about it to people."

246
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,490
But as you see everywhere it happens, even
it happens with us here sometimes, that we

247
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:04,909
get people who do not get Realisation or are
half-baked and they cannot rise much higher.

248
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:11,230
Then they get very angry or sometimes they
take this half-baked knowledge and start working

249
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,000
on it and they go absolutely wrong on this
side or that side.

250
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,240
All such horrible gurus came up in those days
also, but they were neutralised because I

251
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,390
would say that people were spiritually a very
very sensitive.

252
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,370
Nowadays, the people are not.

253
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,650
They are very naive.

254
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,279
They have no sensitivity.

255
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,860
You see from the face you can make out that
a person is such and such, but they have no

256
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
sensitivity left.

257
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,669
You see they are so much used to masks.

258
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:48,400
I asked, “Today why people cannot understand
and why do they always have a mask on the

259
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
faces?

260
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,470
Nothing is beaming out of them, what is it?”

261
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,510
So one told me a very interesting answer:
was that because they listen to news and they

262
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,050
see that the newsman is reading it and he
gets lot of light on his face, so he has to

263
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,919
keep detached from the news, he cannot show
his any impressions or anything.

264
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,340
He has to be absolutely detached when he is
describing some news.

265
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,370
So his face is just like a mask and that is
why it happens.

266
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:20,720
Whatever it is, we have become really naive
as far as spirituality is concerned, and the

267
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,380
people take advantage of it: a full advantage
of this naive behavior or naive nature of

268
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,420
others.

269
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:35,190
For this you don’t have to go to books,
you don’t have to go to any guru for this.

270
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,450
It’s only a thing of the society in which
you live.

271
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,870
Natural societies have much more sensitivity
to spirituality than artificially sort of

272
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:53,049
brainwashed, you can call them, or brought
up in a materialistic atmosphere.

273
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:59,900
They lose their sensitivity to spirituality
which is spontaneous, which is spontaneous;

274
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:09,730
because we lose our spontaneity, we lose that
natural – we call it as ‘Sahaja’, means

275
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:18,880
‘the spontaneous knowledge’ – to know
who is a real person and who is unreal.

276
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:32,570
So this force started manifesting itself gradually
in the caves, in the very secret caves where

277
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,960
only one or two were asked to go there.

278
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,770
And first they were tested very badly.

279
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,789
I mean the way they were tested some would
run away!

280
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,409
So for years together they would not get even
one disciple who was capable of coming into

281
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:49,289
this training.

282
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:55,280
And at long last if they got one, they would
work on him and then he may die without the

283
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
experience.

284
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:03,250
Then again he would be reborn, again he would
die, like that it would go on for ages until

285
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:16,339
then they found that the truth is within you,
till they completely cleansed themselves and

286
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:22,389
they became one with the Higher Being within
themselves.

287
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:30,879
But this was achieved so little that you will
be amazed that Zen system of religion is exactly

288
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,980
the same system, is avadhuta, which we call
the Nath style, the same style is.

289
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,649
And they say there have been only sixty-five
Kashyapas, they call them, Kashyapas.

290
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:44,960
Sixty-five, just imagine!

291
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,359
Sixty-five in six centuries!

292
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:55,809
So I think it would be one point something
one every century!

293
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,940
So these were the only people who got Realisation.

294
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:05,079
And it was a very difficult procedure because
they would raise this Kundalini up to a point

295
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,079
and it would drop out.

296
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,944
Then they would raise it and cleanse it and
then again cleanse it and again push it forward.

297
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:17,549
It would be something like pushing a car which
doesn’t start: you push it, it comes back,

298
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,299
again it goes forward, it’s cut.

299
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:22,630
Then again you cleanse it and take it to the
garage, you see it’s no good.

300
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:28,420
Then you take it again back, wash it, clean
it, again get under it and try to cleanse

301
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,630
it again, the machinery, again it goes out.

302
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,650
Like that it goes on and on and you get so
fed up that you think, “Better let it go

303
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,670
back to the factory to be completely renewed."

304
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:50,289
Then they made it again, put it back and like
that it moved, the movement of this evolution,

305
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,780
very, very gradually.

306
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,309
And in this gradual movement they had…because
if you move gradually you see many things.

307
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:03,589
For example, if you are now going on a bullock
cart – you don’t have any bullock carts,

308
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,380
we still have bullock carts.

309
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,729
If you have to go to villages, you have to
go by bullock carts.

310
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:18,009
And the speed of a bullock cart is maybe two
miles per hour or maybe even sometimes less,

311
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,270
it depends on the whims of the bullocks, you
see.

312
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:25,849
If they sit down in between, you can get down,
cook your food and have your food very nicely,

313
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,680
then again get back into the bullock cart
and then again start moving.

314
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,440
It could be a very, very slow movement.

315
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,309
And then when you stop, you get so bored of
that stay that you get out of bullock cart,

316
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:40,980
you go around and see things.

317
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,730
And that’s how they started seeing things
around and they described them, and poor things

318
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:51,109
got sometimes so upset with it that they used
to get into tantrums and their tantrums also

319
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,979
are nowadays called as ‘Raja Yoga’.

320
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:58,279
I was so surprised that these tantrums were
there because of frustration and because of

321
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,900
timing.

322
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:07,190
But now, today, the condition is different
because the blossom time has come I say.

323
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:14,529
The time has come that evolution has to be
en-masse, has to be en-masse.

324
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:19,799
Actually this en-masse evolution has started
much earlier as I said, from the sixth century

325
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:22,469
when Adi Shankaracharya started writing about
it.

326
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:28,059
He was the one who proclaimed it, who said
that this is the force we have got, we have

327
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,119
to work it out.

328
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,420
Now people talk of Adi Shankaracharya and
not a word about Kundalini.

329
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,119
What do you say to such a knowledge?

330
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:48,380
You see this is the basis, the basis of Shankaracharya
is Kundalini, and the stai bhav is the emotion

331
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,519
that substantiates it – is the complete
dedication to the guru.

332
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:04,740
But the guru is has to be a real guru not
the way moneymaker or what you call this womaniser

333
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,450
and all sorts of things, abuses, which are
absolutely never conceivable to a guru.

334
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,910
He remains absolutely away from these things.

335
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,039
All such things are I would say these are
meant for criminals.

336
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,519
Or you can say, I have no words, but you can
say horrid people.

337
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:33,819
It’s not meant for gurus, who are the choicest
flowers, who are the best people that God

338
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:38,410
has created; who are the highest people above
all these things.

339
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,969
They do not organise, they do not do anything,
they just sit and watch and they just impart

340
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:49,029
you the power by which you become one with
God.

341
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,509
That’s all their job is.

342
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:58,650
They are not busy buying aeroplanes and Cadillacs
and some had some, I was told, Rolls Royces.

343
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,880
They are not busy with.

344
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:08,640
These gurus first took to sanyasa because
it was a very intensive work needed, very

345
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,890
intensive work.

346
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:15,829
In the early times they took absolute solitude
as their home and they didn’t have children,

347
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,670
they didn’t have wives, nothing.

348
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,349
They would just dedicate themselves to the
search.

349
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:26,310
This is very early I am telling you, say twelve
thousand years back but about eight thousand

350
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,519
years and at the time of Rama, all the gurus
practically were married.

351
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,740
Most of the gurus were married.

352
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:38,940
Imagine eight thousand years back, in modern
understanding people cannot even conceive

353
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,009
of a priest who is married.

354
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,380
They found out without the marriage the balance
is not established.

355
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:52,289
You must lead a very sensible married life,
and they got married, and they had children

356
00:39:52,289 --> 00:40:00,279
and wife and they lived in the forest looking
after the small children from the family.

357
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:06,849
And when the children came down there even
the grandparents came with them because according

358
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:13,369
to the four ashramas we have got, the grandparents
are after fifty years of age have to go to

359
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,869
the forest to live with the grandchildren
near the ashram.

360
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:22,339
And they have to look after the children and
forget about married life.

361
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,359
They have to finish it at that time.

362
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,780
At fifty a grandfather is really promoted
and he looks after the children.

363
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,910
He is not bothered about his married life
so much as the husband and wife reach their

364
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:41,960
culmination of the beauty of their married
life and understanding from twenty-five to

365
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,800
fifty years of age.

366
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:50,359
So we have a division that till twenty-five
years is the education system then the twenty-five

367
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:57,599
years of life is the married life and twenty-five
years of life is this life where, vanaprastra

368
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,930
ashram they called it, where they had to live
like grand parents with their grandchildren,

369
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:08,910
give them love and they looked after and also
if they were not realised or they wanted realisation,

370
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,390
they worked for it.

371
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:17,019
So in this system it was perfectly all right
because afterwards the husband and wife died

372
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:22,539
after that age so they took to sanyasa, means
they just detached themselves and rose high.

373
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:28,369
So the pattern of life was such that you had
to achieve God in your lifetime, you have

374
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,130
to work for it and all of them aspired for
it and they worked for it.

375
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,170
The whole life pattern was built up to that.

376
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,729
Of course very few people got realisation
but they led a very righteous life so that

377
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:46,609
they maintained it for the next life and again
they were born next time, they tried it from

378
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:49,970
where they had lost, again they went up and
up like that.

379
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,690
That was the system of that society which
is, of course is, now very much westernised

380
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,549
and they think you people are much more successful
in life so they are running after you and

381
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,079
try to become like you.

382
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,079
But this is what it was.

383
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,259
But we can see today that is not the situation,
we are in a very different situation.

384
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,819
It’s a Ghor Kali Yuga they call it, where
righteousness has no place.

385
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:15,650
If you talk of righteousness people will run
away.

386
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,749
Like today, you see, they wanted to put up
an advertisement for some university, and

387
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:24,999
the lady who was being there, she was telling,
“No, no, no don’t put Self-realisation."

388
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,869
Then I said, “What should I put?”

389
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:30,499
She said, “Put something like enjoying,
you see."

390
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:31,940
“All right, enjoying.

391
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,380
Then what else?”

392
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,699
“You don’t talk of God, no, of righteousness,
no."

393
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:42,200
Then should I say now I thought that you can
enjoy and come to a discotheque or something

394
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
like that?

395
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,180
Is that the way we are going to attract them?

396
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
And then every other person got fed up.

397
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,940
They said, “Mother, we are not going to
fall at their feet.

398
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:59,420
We need really sensible people, people who
understand their value, who want to achieve

399
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,959
something higher; they may be few but we cannot
manage with this frivolous people.

400
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:06,700
We cannot do anything about these frivolous
people.

401
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,380
Let them have one or two shocks in life.

402
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,799
Then they’ll come to us."

403
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:13,959
But you see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to think that “Let them have a shock.

404
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:17,349
Let them put their hands in the electricity
so that they get a shock and next time they

405
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:18,349
won’t do it."

406
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:22,180
You see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to accept such a situation.

407
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,809
But it is so, because we had another gentleman
who was a hippy.

408
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:29,039
He came to me and I tried to give him realisation
this.

409
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,999
Again he went back and he started his drugs
and he went into that.

410
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,259
Again very seriously he did it.

411
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:39,380
He did it very well that doctors declared
that he is going to die within twenty-four

412
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,359
hours, you see he did the whole job very well.

413
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,569
He had all the drugs within him, you could
open a chemist shop, you see, the way he was,

414
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:49,349
and mounds of things he had in him.

415
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:50,549
And then he came to me with a cirrhosis liver.

416
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:52,460
Liver of, you see, liver which was having
cirrhosis.

417
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,089
Thank God, my husband was not at home, so
I said, “All right, get in,” and he was

418
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:59,329
there still when my husband came next day.

419
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:03,690
He found him in an absolutely horrible condition.

420
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:10,740
He said, “Now, if You have anything to do
with this young gentleman, if he dies here,

421
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,289
the police will really arrest You, and You
will be in for murder.

422
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:16,640
Now You please don’t go in for that."

423
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,910
But we treated him and, you’ll be amazed,
within eight days he was perfectly all right

424
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,950
and he’s such a great sahaja yogi today.

425
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,309
Now he’s in Australia; I always remember
him.

426
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:30,469
And you know, he was a professor of physics
and he was a very learned man, but he did

427
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:39,479
all this tomfoolery just to go to hell directly
with a running jump, you see, and it was very

428
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,819
difficult in the beginning to convince him.

429
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,339
But later on, you see, what he told me was
most shocking because he told Me, “Mother,

430
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:50,019
most of us have to be that way, otherwise
we’ll not come to You."

431
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:55,859
Now this is too much for me to understand
that, that it should be so hard on anyone

432
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,980
who are seeking.

433
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:04,349
Now you will be amazed that the seekers who
were there at that time are today born more

434
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:07,859
in the West than in the East.

435
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,339
You are real seekers.

436
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:14,709
Perhaps you have never evaluated yourself,
and you have lost that sensitivity to seeking.

437
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:19,759
That is one thing true because the way you
have been guru-shopping, one can understand

438
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:25,400
that how could it be possible that you have
been going from here to there not understanding

439
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
this.

440
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,660
But, you see, because you were seeking, I
would say, because you were seeking, you jumped

441
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:38,480
onto someone, you jumped onto another one,
jumped onto third one, just to get the, what

442
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,369
you call, the feeling that you were seeking.

443
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:55,309
And this jumping from one to another has really
been very, very wrong because by that you

444
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:57,940
have definitely disturbed your Kundalini.

445
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:05,539
The most dangerous thing about these people
is that they disturbed the path of your Kundalini,

446
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:09,460
which you will learn; when you will be realised,
you will know.

447
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:15,920
All these gurus, apart from giving you diseases
like cancer and all that, have been destroying

448
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,480
your chakras, destroying your Kundalini.

449
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,839
I have seen big holes in your chakras.

450
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:24,059
I have seen burnt portions in the Kundalini.

451
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:31,630
I have seen horrible distortions and mutilations
of even the private parts of people because

452
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,640
you can see on this chakra, this last chakra,
which is dealing with your private parts,

453
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:44,329
you see, that they have really ruined you
completely, to such an extent that it is I

454
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:53,000
feel irreparable, but still, we would try
our level best to work it out and to get it

455
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,559
done.

456
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:02,199
I would only request you to have an attitude
of openness and little relaxed.

457
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:07,869
Like somebody has an appointment say about
seven o’clock, so he comes to attend my

458
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,989
program – six to seven, Mataji’s lecture.

459
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:12,299
Seven to eight, third lecture.

460
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,099
Eight to nine, another lecture.

461
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,329
Such a person is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

462
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:25,220
You have to have patience with yourself and
you have to have patience with Sahaja Yoga

463
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:31,249
too because some people from the jungles and
who are not in the open, who do not come to

464
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:36,849
London or to America, these people have told
so many sahaja yogis that “We don’t know

465
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,950
why Mataji is giving you these vibrations.

466
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,009
What have you done?”

467
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:43,729
All sorts of questions and they are quite
jealous and they don’t even understand how

468
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:48,759
these sahaja yogis can raise the Kundalini
so easily.

469
00:47:48,759 --> 00:47:56,910
So one can say that it is happening and it
is there, you all should have it because you

470
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:05,069
are the seekers and this blessing was to be
bestowed, is promised even in the Puranas

471
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:12,940
it was said that in Kali Yuga those saints
who are seeking God in the hills and dales

472
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:22,910
will be blessed in Kali Yuga, in this time,
modern times and they will be born as ordinary

473
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:27,529
householders and they will get their ultimately
truth, it is a fact.

474
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,299
You have to see it.

475
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:33,329
And no use, I was told some people are coming
here for spying.

476
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:35,410
I say, “What are they spying?”

477
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,809
You see, this is for your good.

478
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:40,449
What is there to spy in this thing?

479
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,019
It is all very open.

480
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:47,349
This is for your good, for your betterment,
for your own life.

481
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:49,839
For whom are you spying?

482
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,759
What are they going to give you, madness?

483
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:56,790
They’ll take away all your money.

484
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,449
As a mother I must tell you, you have to be
careful.

485
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:05,329
They may pay you little money for spying but
what’s the use of loosing your spirit and

486
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:09,329
getting that little money, all the false promises.

487
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:16,650
Best thing is to get it within yourself, your
own powers and know yourself and know what

488
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:23,499
is your self-interest and don’t be just
wasting yourself for all these nonsensical

489
00:49:23,499 --> 00:49:32,640
things like crusades and, what you call, stories
about it.

490
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,869
People have misused all the knowledge that
was in the Bible, in the Quran, in the Vedas

491
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:44,859
for exploiting others, it is something very
sad but human beings are like that, they are

492
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:45,859
really like that.

493
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:52,249
So we have to be very, very careful and we
have to understand that we have to have our

494
00:49:52,249 --> 00:49:53,619
own power.

495
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,519
What is the use if I am very powerful?

496
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,519
What’s the use?

497
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:03,079
If the sun is very powerful, what’s the
use unless and until it does some good to

498
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:04,079
us?

499
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,219
If I have the power, say, to move all this,
what’s the use?

500
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:11,219
You must have your powers.

501
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:12,219
You must feel your powers.

502
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,170
You should be able to exercise your powers.

503
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,579
That is what you must ask.

504
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:25,390
This is the main theme of Sahaja Yoga: that
it is your own power which starts manifesting.

505
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,099
So, thank you very much.

506
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,630
I hope the lecture was not too great for you.

507
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:37,670
But today I was just thinking that today I
will tell you about this guru dynasty because

508
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,700
this is the way the gurus are there by the
dozens.

509
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,900
You must know that what is a real guru.

510
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,699
And how they came in and what was their job.

511
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:52,329
There’s one more point I would like to tell
you that……

512
00:50:52,329 --> 00:51:04,059
[UNCLEAR] here there are two more small chakras,
one that belongs to, which we call as the

513
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:05,059
Surya.

514
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:12,259
Surya is the, means the Sun, the Sun centre
and the another as the Moon centre on the

515
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:13,319
left-hand side.

516
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:25,859
And these two are governed or, we can say,
is bestowed upon by two great people who are

517
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:29,069
the disciple elements.

518
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:36,119
And disciple elements were first, were born
to Shri Rama and Shri Sita as the Luv and

519
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:37,119
Kush.

520
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,339
And then they incarnated many a times on this
Earth as disciple.

521
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:48,769
One of them is, we can say, was Shankaracharya,
another was Kabira, like that.

522
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:56,839
Then we can say, later on like, before Shankaracharya,
they came as Buddha and Mahavira.

523
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:08,599
Then Shankaracharya and then I told you, after
Shankaracharya came the advent of Hassan and

524
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,979
Hussain, who were the grandsons of Prophet.

525
00:52:12,979 --> 00:52:20,509
So these have been incarnating and they have
been moving from one side to another and telling

526
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:24,960
people that “This is extreme, leave it,
this is extreme, leave it.

527
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,930
Come in the centre and be in the centre."

528
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,479
That has been their job and they are the ones
who are sort of imparting you that awareness

529
00:52:33,479 --> 00:52:35,469
by you become a perfect disciple.

530
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:47,660
And this is a very important point because
it comes quite often that we do not understand:

531
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,930
like Prophet Mohammad said that “I am the
last prophet."

532
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,160
All right, He did say that He was the last
prophet.

533
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,559
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come
here.

534
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,439
All right I would say just to frighten you
that you better take to it otherwise this

535
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:06,069
is the last time I am telling you.

536
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:11,999
But it is never that because when He died
He found out that, you see, these people are

537
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:12,999
mad caps.

538
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:15,509
“I didn’t tell them this, what are they
doing out of Me?”

539
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:20,030
So he said, “I better go back again,”
and He came as Nanaka and He told them that

540
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:27,249
“Hindu and Muslims are same people, following
the same religion, why are you fighting among

541
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:28,249
yourselves?”

542
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:29,249
He came for that unity.

543
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:36,030
Then as Nanaka He came; so in Nanaka’s system
also the Sikhism came in and they started

544
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,890
a warrior class and this and that.

545
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:43,210
I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having
wars within Muslims and Hindus.

546
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,990
So then He came as Shirdi Sai Nath to teach
them.

547
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,519
Now this is not a very important thing that,
say Mohammad Sahib said, “I am the last."

548
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,439
Say He is the last, all right, even take that
position.

549
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,900
Who are you to him?

550
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,900
How are you related?

551
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,900
Through what?

552
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,640
What is your authority?

553
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,140
How do you appropriate Him to yourself?

554
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,660
Because you say you are Muslims.

555
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,660
So what?

556
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,730
How did you become Muslims?

557
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,630
Did you get your certificate from God?

558
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,200
Like Christians are, you see.

559
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,859
They say, “We are Christians."

560
00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:14,049
How are they?

561
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:15,229
They are baptised.

562
00:54:15,229 --> 00:54:16,229
How?

563
00:54:16,229 --> 00:54:19,299
They go to church, somebody puts the hand.

564
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,369
Who is he?

565
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,299
Is he authorised by God?

566
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:24,989
Does he really break your fontanel bone?

567
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:26,920
Does he really blesses you?

568
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,219
He is just appropriating God to himself.

569
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:32,119
How are they concerned with God?

570
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:33,269
I don’t understand.

571
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,969
They are nowhere near Christ, I can see that
clearly.

572
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:39,219
If they were, they would have been doing something
else.

573
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:44,420
They would have given realisation to people
and giving them the second birth which Christ

574
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,469
has told again and again that “You are to
be born again."

575
00:54:47,469 --> 00:54:52,049
I am talking of the eternal life, and not
this life of organizing churches and making

576
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:56,930
profits so much so that the half of London
should belong to a church.

577
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:03,029
Same with Hindus, another silly people.

578
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:06,589
One would think they did not organise it so
it could not go further.

579
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:09,930
Even there is one of the Shankaracharya’s,
he is trying to collect money.

580
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,599
I said, “For what is he collecting the money,
this fellow?”

581
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:13,650
They said, “Oh, no.

582
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,660
He wants, now he is trying to, you see, sort
of, compete with your Pope."

583
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,679
So he wants to begin with, he wants to have
an umbrella of gold, embedded with all precious

584
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:24,679
stones.

585
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:26,099
He’s a tiny little fellow.

586
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:32,949
I don’t know how he is going to look with
that big umbrella around him.

587
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:36,589
All such people claim.

588
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:39,489
It is such a misappropriation.

589
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:41,079
What is the authority you have got?

590
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,739
This is something I can’t understand.

591
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,779
Everybody goes to theological college.

592
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:48,039
How can he learn God in the college?

593
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:49,390
What college did Christ go?

594
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,230
I mean of all the things, when you have Christ
before you why don’t you judge according

595
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,230
to His standards?

596
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,609
Which college did Christ go?

597
00:55:57,609 --> 00:55:59,130
Which theological college?

598
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:04,749
If He had, if He was to come here, people
would say that He’s good for nothing.

599
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:07,359
They may put Him in the prison again.

600
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:13,559
And in America sure, because if you cure anybody
in America you are in the jail.

601
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,660
That’s what it is.

602
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:20,849
So the whole misappropriation has been worked
out.

603
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:28,160
By this awareness, the vibratory awareness
you get after realisation, you will know that

604
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,869
you cannot be misappropriated, by which you
become that.

605
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:40,099
Once you become that, then you can feel it,
those vibrations flowing into you, you can

606
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:50,519
feel your heart emitting those vibrations
because the Spirit is awakened and you can

607
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:56,660
feel that and you get that vibratory awareness
by which, as you see on the hands, you can

608
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,249
feel your chakras.

609
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:03,000
That is Self-realisation: knowing about yourself
and also you know about others.

610
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,259
It can happen just in a second, in a split
of a second.

611
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:08,869
With some people it takes time, doesn’t
matter.

612
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:11,820
I have patience, you have patience.

613
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,729
I’m only for this job here and I am going
to be here for years.

614
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:21,890
Now I hope so, for some years at least and
we are going to work it out.

615
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,279
So thank you very much.

616
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:28,229
Now if you have to ask any questions, please
ask me for a short time because then we should

617
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:30,670
go to the workshop.

618
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:38,209
Can I have some water please.

619
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:44,489
Shri Mataji: Yes … little louder.

620
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,009
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

621
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:57,950
Shri Mataji: The coming incarnation is the
Kalki, as they call it, Kalki is the one which

622
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:03,579
means nishkalanka, means the one which is
blemishless, there is no blemish on that person,

623
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:05,740
you cannot put a blemish on Him.

624
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,019
If you try to do it, you will be destroyed.

625
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:14,689
But this One is going to come just to do the
last sorting-out.

626
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:18,910
You won’t have anybody to persuade you,
to tell you that, “Get your realisation,”

627
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,910
nothing of the kind.

628
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:27,230
You see, He will just come as we have after
the whole harvest is done, then the last cutting

629
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,230
of it.

630
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:32,609
He is just coming for that; He is not going
to talk to you; He is not going to listen

631
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,339
to you, nothing doing.

632
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:41,859
The time from this to that is short, so you
better get yourself in the proper shape and

633
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:45,349
don’t ask for His coming just now because
it will be very hasty.

634
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:50,670
Just now let all of you be there in the boat
properly settled down, let us go onto the

635
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,799
other side and then let Him come, because
He’s coming with eleven powers, which is

636
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,489
known as Ekadasha Rudra.

637
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:04,499
They are all placed here in the head of the
primordial being and He will be manifesting

638
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:13,339
all these in such a tremendous manner that
you would not know how people will be destroyed,

639
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:19,259
and the destruction will be of the worst type
that you have ever seen that’s why try to

640
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:25,539
mature; became the fruits and be in the kingdom
of God.

641
00:59:25,539 --> 00:59:26,880
All right.

642
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,219
Thank you.

643
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:30,229
Yes, my child?

644
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:33,589
Question: Who is Your guru?

645
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:35,599
Shri Mataji: Nobody.

646
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,309
I have no guru, I’m a mother.

647
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:44,599
I don’t need any guru and I have been like
this since ages now.

648
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:46,079
I’m very ancient.

649
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,079
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

650
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:49,529
Shri Mataji: That’s my own.

651
00:59:49,529 --> 00:59:58,150
I have no guru, neither I ever had, but I
have the guru, I call him as Dattatreya, if

652
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,160
that is so, but that is also within Me.

653
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,390
In my stomach is the guru.

654
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:07,539
You ask this question, “Mother, have You
any guru?”

655
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:10,890
Just ask this question in your hand, and you
will know it.

656
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:17,009
To know me is not so easy because I’m very
elusive, extremely elusive person you can

657
01:00:17,009 --> 01:00:18,939
think of, you see.

658
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:22,109
So just now you just know yourself.

659
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:23,109
All right?

660
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:28,390
When you will have that awareness, you will
know Me.

661
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,109
All right?

662
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:31,839
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

663
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,789
Shri Mataji: Because you don’t have those
eyes to know Me.

664
01:00:37,789 --> 01:00:39,809
Good question also.

665
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:51,709
Who was the guru of Christ?

666
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:53,609
Who was?

667
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:59,329
His own mother.

668
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:05,049
So, no questions?

669
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:08,859
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

670
01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:14,579
Shri Mataji: Correct.

671
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:28,119
Absolutely that’s what… very true, yes.

672
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,450
No.

673
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:32,779
Yeah.

674
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:39,359
So what is your question in this?

675
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:45,309
All right, I will tell you one thing that,
you see, if you go to these temples and places

676
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:47,589
where you think that they are misappropriating
or not.

677
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:53,960
Now as I have said to you already that the
job of a person who represents God or says

678
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:00,380
that he is God or he has the power of God
within himself should do only one thing, is

679
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,239
that he should be able to connect you with
God, that’s all, the rest of the things

680
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:06,619
is absolutely useless.

681
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:12,029
If he cannot connect you to God then he is
absolutely useless person.

682
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:20,890
For example we get a person who says he is
the Secretary to the Queen, her Majesty the

683
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:26,420
Queen, then he should be able to get at least
an appointment for us otherwise how are we

684
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,099
to believe that they have any authority?

685
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:35,459
Now if you say that people believe in things
and that ….[UNCLEAR] now, you see, believing

686
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:41,579
into something has led you nowhere, see it
is blindness, on the contrary this kind of

687
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:46,049
blindness has led to complete exploitation.

688
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:50,859
You have seen in our country or in anywhere,
you are completely exploited.

689
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:58,439
You do not realise it how much you are exploited
by these organisations which claim and appropriate

690
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:03,589
that God is with them or sort of they are
serving the God.

691
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:09,650
The only thing that they should do to find
out the ways and methods of connecting you

692
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:10,829
to God.

693
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:13,525
If they cannot do it then one should know
that there is something wrong with them.

694
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:17,109
They have no authority of any kind.

695
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:20,130
Question or comment: [INAUDIBLE]

696
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,160
Shri Mataji: Can organise?

697
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,869
No, not at all.

698
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:25,869
They cannot.

699
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:28,180
It’s a child’s play going on.

700
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,259
They cannot.

701
01:03:29,259 --> 01:03:30,679
How can you.

702
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:38,880
See it’s now but how can they You see, you
cannot organise God, you must have authority,

703
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,459
you should be a realised soul, minimum, connected
with God.

704
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:48,009
Say, supposing this is not connected, all
right, with the mains.

705
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:49,479
What can you organise it?

706
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:51,809
You better put it down there, isn’t it?

707
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:55,900
Otherwise you cannot use it.

708
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,900
What else can you do?

709
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,349
Supposing this is not connected with the mains,
it is not working, that’s all, simple.

710
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:06,279
You try everything, you organise, you organise
a committee, bring many people to plan it,

711
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:12,680
it won’t work out, unless and until you
connect it.

712
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:19,239
So called, so called baptism is useless, but
the real baptism is there, the Kundalini rises,

713
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:29,029
you will be surprised this portion becomes
absolutely soft here, just like a child.

714
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:34,940
Actualisation is important, if they cannot
actualise it, what are they doing?

715
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:39,429
This is like, you see, you send an invitation
to people, “Please come and have dinner

716
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:43,669
with us and come along and we have organised
a very good dinner and everything,” you

717
01:04:43,669 --> 01:04:47,319
go there you find a table very nicely laid
down and everything is there, they ask you

718
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:52,339
sit on the chair and all that, and then they
will say “Will you eat?” and there’s

719
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:54,859
no dinner, nothing, what means?

720
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:57,569
They say, “It is very tasty dinner."

721
01:04:57,569 --> 01:05:00,400
Everybody looks at each other, “Yes, must
be."

722
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,919
You see, the one thinks that “Maybe we are
blind, you know, maybe that we are little

723
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:05,919
foolish, we cannot do it."

724
01:05:05,919 --> 01:05:22,559
You see, so it would be like that, you see.
