1994-10-15 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

2
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:32,510
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:44,196
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

4
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:54,246
We cannot change it; we cannot transform it.

5
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,008
Also, unfortunately,

6
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:05,779
with this human awareness we cannot know it.

7
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:14,330
Can they hear, all of them? Ask them can they hear, all of them.

8
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,748
Yogini: He is saying that with the fan it is not helping,

9
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:27,977
All right, then put it off.

10
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:33,381
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

11
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:40,005
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

12
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:49,872
Better. It makes too much sound; fan was making too much sound.

13
00:06:56,401 --> 00:07:03,638
So now we have to know that our awareness

14
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:10,545
is not sufficient enough to know the absolute Truth.

15
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:20,103
Actually, we don't know the absolute Truth.

16
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,151
That's why there is a problem.

17
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:32,755
Somebody says this is good. Somebody says that is good.

18
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:39,399
There is a quarrel, fight, arguments, and ultimately wars.

19
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:51,213
That means we have to evolve more.

20
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,648
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

21
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:04,137
you should not accept it blindfolded,

22
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:18,086
but accept it as a hypothesis.

23
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:27,478
And if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people.

24
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:36,501
Because it is for your benevolence,

25
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:40,509
for the benevolence of your family, your country,

26
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,857
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

27
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,974
At the very outset, I would like to tell you

28
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:05,341
that the truth is you are not this body, this mind,

29
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:14,635
these emotions, intellect, conditionings, or your ego.

30
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,885
But you are the pure Spirit.

31
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:37,440
There is another truth is, you see all these beautiful flowers

32
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,265
and we take them for granted.

33
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:51,371
Actually, it's a miracle.

34
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,452
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

35
00:09:56,652 --> 00:10:00,948
so he will say, It is the autonomous nervous system.

36
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,949
But who is this auto?

37
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,809
Also, if you take to science you will find they cannot answer

38
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:21,448
all the questions because it has its own limitations.

39
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:33,438
For example, science cannot tell you why are you on this earth,

40
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:40,897
what is your identity.

41
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:45,293
So we take to religions.

42
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:49,524
But in the modern times, religions have become

43
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:53,739
money oriented or power oriented.

44
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:07,974
Also, it was great incarnations who came

45
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:13,525
like Christ, Mohammed Saab, Moses.

46
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:19,438
They were very great, pure incarnations

47
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,549
and they did not know what sort of people they were facing.

48
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:34,061
The way they were tortured and crucified.

49
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:46,348
They preached to people who cannot follow their followings,

50
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:50,880
they cannot follow their principles.

51
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:00,870
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter  Mathews

52
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,757
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take out the eye.

53
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:20,112
If your one hand does some sinful thing, you cut out the hand.

54
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:27,751
If somebody slaps you on this face, turn the other face.

55
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,908
I haven't seen any Christian without eye and without hands.

56
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:45,704
It's an impossible thing and very difficult.

57
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,134
It was easy for Christ to say that because He was so great.

58
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,359
Actually, you have to become a saint to follow His principles.

59
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:12,572
Ordinary people cannot follow Him.

60
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,833
Then I think Mohammed Saab thought that He was so strict

61
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:26,906
with the men, so He made lots of laws for the women also.

62
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:37,107
And so strict that any woman who looked at any man

63
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:40,443
with any lust, she should be buried halfway

64
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:44,756
and should be stoned.

65
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:55,999
Imagine what would have happened to American women.

66
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,563
So the principle of morality

67
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:10,763
was really too much for normal human beings.

68
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:21,908
Also, the Sharia which was brought in by Mohammed Saab

69
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:26,788
was given by Moses for the Jews.

70
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,928
In the Bible in the Old Testament, in the Jeremiah,

71
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:41,557
it is described clearly.

72
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,415
But Jews thought it was too much, so they didnt bother.

73
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:56,505
But Muslims think they can do it; I am sure they can't.

74
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,070
So, they believe they are Muslims, but they are not.

75
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:12,734
Christians believe they are Christians, but they are not.

76
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:18,177
First you have to become a saint.

77
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:23,565
You have to become an enlightened personality

78
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:30,761
so that automatically you become righteous, automatically.

79
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:39,224
In Sahaja Yoga, we dont have any punishments.

80
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:45,934
Here, we have to accept human beings as they are.

81
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:57,143
There are no confessions, and no physical or mental punishments.

82
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:06,610
At the most, we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:18,052
As this Power lies in the sacrum bone, it's your own.

84
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:28,411
She is your Mother, your individual Mother.

85
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:35,399
She knows all about you

86
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:40,388
and She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

87
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,798
It is in the real sense of the word

88
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:49,420
[that] you have to have your second birth.

89
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:57,625
It is not just a make-believe that you are twice born.

90
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,352
It becomes like any other brand like you are a Christian

91
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:10,677
or a Hindu or a Muslim or a twice born.

92
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,411
But anybody can commit any sin.

93
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,250
Anybody can commit any sin.

94
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:39,694
So one has to become innately righteous,

95
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:44,253
innately moral.

96
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:54,377
It's only possible when you become the Spirit.

97
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:03,152
When this Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers

98
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:07,201
which are responsible for our physical, mental,

99
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:11,651
emotional, and spiritual being.

100
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,744
Thus, our physical being improves,

101
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:27,384
or sometimes absolutely in perfect condition.

102
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:36,778
In India there are four doctors from Delhi university

103
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:41,205
who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,185
Many incurable diseases can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:18:53,185 --> 00:19:01,255
For diagnosis or for treatment, you don't have to go to hospitals

106
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:09,748
because you know self-knowledge.

107
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:14,120
You get self-knowledge

108
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:21,863
because you start feeling on your fingertips your own centers.

109
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,489
You start feeling this all-pervading Power on your fingertips.

110
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,011
So, this is the second truth that you have to know

111
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:44,445
that there is an all-pervading Power of divine Love.

112
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,981
In the Koran, Mohammed Saab has clearly said that

113
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,753
when you will get your resurrection,

114
00:19:56,953 --> 00:20:02,643
your hands, your fingers will know about you

115
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:07,539
and they will tell you about you.

116
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:21,643
This is the time of your resurrection.

117
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:31,656
I call it a blossom time, but in the Bible it is described as the last judgement.

118
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,726
You have to choose; you are free to choose.

119
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,328
If you want to go to hell, you can go.

120
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:46,739
If you want to go to heaven, you can go.

121
00:20:55,925 --> 00:21:04,204
From the day you get your realization,

122
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:10,109
you start the transformation within yourself.

123
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:20,063
In the light of the Spirit, you become your own guide,

124
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:24,263
your own master.

125
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:31,544
You give up everything that is destructive.

126
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:41,935
You give up everything that is not for your progress.

127
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,809
All bad habits drop out automatically.

128
00:21:52,824 --> 00:22:01,174
And these bad habits just remove all the diseases,

129
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:05,906
all the destructiveness from your body.

130
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:17,680
Its like this: if I am holding a snake, and there is darkness

131
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,312
and I cant see, and I am obstinate,

132
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:26,473
I am not going to believe if you tell me its a snake.

133
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:44,373
And unless and until the snake bites, I won't give it up.

134
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,951
But if there is little light, even little light,

135
00:22:56,151 --> 00:23:01,901
immediately I will throw away the snake on my own.

136
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:13,245
That is why enlightenment is the most important thing.

137
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:18,369
If you want to save the world,

138
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,181
it is important that we should take to our enlightenment

139
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:26,930
and give enlightenment to others.

140
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:35,918
As a result of this, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

141
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:40,235
devoid of lust and greed.

142
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,874
Innocence is an eternal thing,

143
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:55,701
but we have covered it with some clouds.

144
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:04,251
It is never destroyed,

145
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:11,142
and it comes back as soon as you get your enlightenment.

146
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,404
So your attention becomes not only innocent

147
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:23,291
but very powerful and active.

148
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:32,104
Wherever you put attention, it acts.

149
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:39,920
Such a person emits joy and peace.

150
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:50,004
Then you know the absolute Truth.

151
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:57,258
That means everybody knows the same truth.

152
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,494
Supposing if you have ten children who are realized souls

153
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:06,545
and tie their eyes, and ask them what is wrong with this person,

154
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:10,792
they will all lift the same fingers.

155
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:24,934
So in our awareness, a new dimension is created

156
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:30,600
called as vibratory awareness.

157
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:43,020
Many people don't believe in God. But if you want to know,

158
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,043
you just put your hands and ask, Is there God?

159
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:51,788
And immediately you start getting tremendous cool breeze in your hands.

160
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:05,252
And if you, say, want to find out was Christ the son of God,

161
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:11,480
you just find out. And it is true because you get the cool breeze.

162
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:24,985
But if there is falsehood, if there is a false master,

163
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,864
you can immediately make it out because you get heat,

164
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:32,186
sometimes pins and needles.

165
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:45,217
Everybody knows the same.

166
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:56,525
Then the greatest thing that happens to you

167
00:26:56,725 --> 00:27:01,638
[is] that you become collectively conscious.

168
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,097
Because you can feel the vibrations of another person,

169
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:18,437
and you can feel the chakras, the centers of another person also.

170
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:26,097
Then who is the other?

171
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:31,757
Like a microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

172
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:37,489
Microcosm becomes a macrocosm.

173
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:42,388
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

174
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:53,313
And such love, pure love and compassion flows in them.

175
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:04,764
Then you understand the value of another person also,

176
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:12,456
and also your own value.

177
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:17,917
But you become humble.

178
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:24,414
You can give realization to others. You can cure others.

179
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:34,836
That is how one enlightened light can enlighten other lights.

180
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:40,284
It's a natural process.

181
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:43,105
Just like a seed. If you put it in the Mother Earth,

182
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:47,273
it sprouts by itself.

183
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:53,258
Because in the seed it is built in to sprout

184
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:58,911
and it is in the Mother Earth the power is there to sprout.

185
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:10,211
This is how everything is built in within you.

186
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,417
It is spontaneous, means Sahaj.

187
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:22,575
Means it is born with you, this right to have this union, yoga,

188
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:26,775
with this divine Power.

189
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:36,338
When we think, we think about the past or the future.

190
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:41,219
We cannot be in the present which is the reality.

191
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,417
We think about the future and past,

192
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:48,773
and we cannot be in reality, which is the present.

193
00:29:56,466 --> 00:30:01,324
Because the past is finished [and] the future doesn't exist.

194
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:09,999
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts

195
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:14,764
and establishes the silence in between them.

196
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:27,843
That time you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

197
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:36,185
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

198
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,644
You want to think, you can think. You don't want to think,

199
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:46,505
you need not think.

200
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:54,501
But inspirations start coming.

201
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:03,624
This state is the state of peace within yourself.

202
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,226
You become a witness of the whole drama,

203
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:14,309
and you become extremely peaceful within yourself.

204
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:22,852
There is no stress, there is no strain.

205
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:31,522
You become so free of all these things.

206
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:39,357
Actually, you become your own master.

207
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:52,031
Last of all, the greatest thing that happens to you

208
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:57,598
[is] that you jump into the ocean of joy.

209
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:12,055
When you are happy or unhappy, these are two sides of a coin.

210
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:19,223
When your ego is pampered, you are happy;

211
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:24,157
when it is punctured, you are unhappy.

212
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:34,567
But joy is singular.

213
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:43,169
And it's a state in which you transcend all these limitations

214
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:47,470
of your conditionings.

215
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,637
For example, we have huge gatherings in India

216
00:32:56,837 --> 00:33:00,992
of people who have become saints

217
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:04,390
and it is surprising [that] I have never seen them quarreling,

218
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,817
fighting, nothing of the kind.

219
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:23,090
It's a state in which you realize your importance,

220
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,509
your glory and the glory of others.

221
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:38,339
Its all your own.

222
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:42,622
It's all within you.

223
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:49,238
This power, what we call Kundalini, is in the sacrum bone

224
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:54,609
that means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

225
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:10,201
Now this power of yours is the power of pure desire.

226
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:16,953
All other desires are not pure.

227
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:22,573
Today we ask for a house, we get it. Then we try to get a car,

228
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:25,329
then we want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane

229
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:29,833
I mean there is no end to it.

230
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:36,342
It is not satiable.

231
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:39,561
In general, they say, wants are not satiable.

232
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,773
Economics says so.

233
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:50,714
So whether you are aware or not aware,

234
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:57,299
this power of pure desire in within you.

235
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:06,605
And once you get connected with this all-pervading Power,

236
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:11,086
all your problems get solved.

237
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:17,277
Even economic

238
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:20,637
[and] political.

239
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:27,126
Because most of the world problems come from human beings.

240
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:32,591
And all the human problems come from these chakras,

241
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:36,863
from these centers.

242
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:41,007
If these centers are somehow or other corrected,

243
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:46,249
the whole world can be a beautiful place to live in.

244
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:56,650
By talking about peace or having organizations of peace,

245
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,717
you cannot have peace.

246
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:06,813
I have known people who have got awards in peace

247
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:12,114
and [are] absolutely very hot tempered, very.

248
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,940
They never even smile. They never even smile.

249
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:30,300
And if you have to approach them, it is better to go through a barge pole.

250
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:37,333
I dont know how they get peace awards.

251
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,333
You have to have peace within.

252
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:54,107
In this short lecture I dont think I can tell you everything about it.

253
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:03,226
But like in this beautiful hall you have so many lights.

254
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:07,459
Only you have to switch on, thats all.

255
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:16,734
But if I go on telling you about the history of this electricity,

256
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,950
how it came here, it is so boring.

257
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:31,186
So why not get it, enlightenment?

258
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:37,496
It is so easy.

259
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:41,969
You cant pay for it, you must understand this.

260
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:48,671
God doesn't understand money.

261
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:53,300
He doesn't understand banking that's our headache.

262
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:02,222
I don't know how people can sell God in the market.

263
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:11,391
Its all right [that] you can pay for this hall, all right.

264
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,216
But not for your Realization.

265
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:30,129
It will hardly take 15 minutes for you to get your Realization.

266
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:37,875
You are feeling warm, but after that you will feel very cool.

267
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,984
But as I said, I cannot force on you.

268
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:53,222
If you don't want, I cannot do it.

269
00:38:55,285 --> 00:39:00,091
So those who do not want to have, have to go out.

270
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:08,455
It is not mental; it is beyond the mind.

271
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,817
So even My lecture is just an introduction,

272
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:18,342
but it is not the happening.

273
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,991
Happening is the actualization,

274
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,327
I would say the actualization of your baptism.

275
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:40,620
It's the experience, it is not just talking.

276
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:46,014
And you all can have this experience,

277
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:50,536
not at all difficult.

278
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:58,291
You dont have to think about it, just it will work automatically.

279
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:07,127
There is no problem of any kind that you will face.

280
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:17,074
I feel Brazil can do very well in Sahaja Yoga

281
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,352
because people are faithful and simple-hearted.

282
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:36,302
As in Russia I found they have no conditioning of any kind.

283
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:47,395
At least 65 to 70% people are very sensitive to spirituality.

284
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:55,179
The rest are stupid I must say.

285
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:59,729
They are taking to American culture of Coca-Cola and all that.

286
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,639
They want Marlboro cigarettes.

287
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:15,427
In Russia, in one place called Togliatti,

288
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:20,916
we have got about 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

289
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:31,024
And also the government is very good there, I mean the universities.

290
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:37,318
They have thrown away all other false gurus from there, everyone.

291
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,827
Surprisingly, they awarded Me

292
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:48,323
the award of the St. Petersburg university,

293
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:52,758
which was the oldest university,

294
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:03,299
as the honorary academician which were only ten so far.

295
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:07,108
I am the tenth.

296
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:13,216
And one of them is Einstein.

297
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,279
One of them is Enstein.

298
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:24,734
I was quite surprised, you know. So I said,

299
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:29,959
Why do you include Me with Einstein? He was such a great scientist.

300
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:37,265
So they said that, Mother, what Einstein has done

301
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,999
is only on the matter. You are working on human beings.

302
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,837
So they have given Me such a high award.

303
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:54,690
I said, I am not doing anything. Actually, they have their own powers,

304
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,711
and they are getting awakened to it. What am I doing about it?

305
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,640
I don't know.

306
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:11,251
But they are very sensitive people. There were 2000 scientists

307
00:43:16,748 --> 00:43:20,349
in that conference.

308
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:23,517
They dont have much conditionings.

309
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:27,810
I think they are people who are like clean slate.

310
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:30,929
- Like? - Like clean slate,

311
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:35,354
Clean slate, on which we write, clean slate.

312
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:47,812
And it has worked really wonders there.

313
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:55,765
So, I would request those who do not want to have

314
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:58,062
their Self Realization should leave the hall

315
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:02,754
because it is not proper to disturb in-between.

316
00:44:11,197 --> 00:44:14,069
But after Realization,

317
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:26,520
one should not sort of get dissolved into that and do not grow.

318
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:41,220
Because it is in the beginning you will feel really on top of the world.

319
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:47,489
But you have to grow.

320
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:53,986
You have to grow in the collective.

321
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:59,616
You cannot grow in your houses or your homes, or in your rooms.

322
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:06,956
But you don't have to give up anything.

323
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:13,558
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads

324
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:20,238
or go to Gobi Desert to get nirvana.

325
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:27,684
Here, on your seats, you will get your Realization.

326
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:36,533
Don't have to give up your family, don't have to give up anything.

327
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:43,838
You don't have to change your dress or anything.

328
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:52,123
In Chicago I met a gentleman, the head of the Hare Rama.

329
00:45:56,549 --> 00:46:01,979
He was wearing a dhoti, what we wear in India, a dhoti.

330
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:12,330
Specially that day it was very cold in Chicago.

331
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:19,014
I said, Why do you wear a dhoti in this cold? Its terribly cold.

332
00:46:19,214 --> 00:46:23,276
As a mother, I feel concerned.

333
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:32,339
He said, My guru has initiated me like this.

334
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:38,412
I said, Do you think that by wearing this dhoti

335
00:46:38,612 --> 00:46:42,612
you will get your nirvana?

336
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:49,730
80% people in India wear dhotis and go on saying,

337
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,179
Hare Rama, hare Krishna. Are they all going to get nirvana?

338
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:08,502
I mean if they all go to heaven, where will you be?

339
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:17,712
It is the internal change that is needed, not outward.

340
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:24,192
I think you all are intelligent people, and you will understand

341
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:27,631
what I am saying.

342
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:34,095
We don't have any organization.

343
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:37,219
We don't have any priesthood. We have no hierarchies.

344
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:41,097
Nothing of the kind. Everybody is equally the same.

345
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:49,543
I have no secretary. I travel every day, practically.

346
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:53,694
Tomorrow I am going to Sao Paulo and then I am going to other places.

347
00:47:53,894 --> 00:47:58,068
Everyday practically I am travelling.

348
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:07,897
But I don't think I am travelling. I don't think.

349
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:14,557
I will be 72 years of age [but] I dont feel tired.

350
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:24,886
I am the same because I feel tremendous love for all of you.

351
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:32,296
That compels Me to travel.

352
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:41,045
And that love itself is so nourishing

353
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:47,214
and so joy giving.

354
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:51,476
Same thing you all can have.

355
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:56,219
You all can have the same powers.

356
00:48:56,983 --> 00:49:01,819
These are your potential things which you must get.

357
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:21,958
Now, this mother Kundalini, She knows everything about you.

358
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:26,947
Like a tape recorder, She has taped everything. She knows you.

359
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:36,015
She knows what mistakes you have committed,

360
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:40,732
She knows what are your aspirations, She knows you.

361
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,632
So please dont judge yourself.

362
00:49:52,218 --> 00:49:57,911
She knows and She is anxious to give you your second birth.

363
00:50:02,388 --> 00:50:04,688
So just understand

364
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:12,390
that you should not feel at all in any way diffident.

365
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:22,529
You must have complete respect for yourself.

366
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:29,931
That means you should not feel guilty at all.

367
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:34,120
This is the first condition that

368
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:39,962
please don't feel guilty about anything that has happened in the past.

369
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,545
Past is finished, we are in the present.

370
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:57,394
So this is a very important condition because if you feel guilty,

371
00:50:57,594 --> 00:51:02,844
the center on the left-hand side is in jeopardy.

372
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:18,960
So you may get Spondylitis, you may get Angina,

373
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,972
you may get Tuberculosis

374
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:32,704
or, could be, lethargic organs.

375
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:36,140
So what is the use of feeling guilty

376
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,778
and troubling yourself like this?

377
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:52,248
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone

378
00:51:52,448 --> 00:51:56,437
even without thinking about them.

379
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:02,437
As this center is caught up,

380
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:06,335
the Kundalini cannot rise above this center.

381
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:18,011
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

382
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:22,324
It is a myth.

383
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:25,029
Because if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

384
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:29,190
and torture yourself.

385
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:35,656
Specially at this moment.

386
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:41,273
The center on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted.

387
00:52:48,236 --> 00:52:52,329
And if you don't forgive, it won't open out.

388
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:56,183
And at this moment,

389
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:59,558
you will miss the great opportunity of Self Realization

390
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:04,601
because Kundalini won't be able to pass through that center.

391
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,616
Also, don't think about people whom you have to forgive

392
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:19,876
because it is a very painful, I think, sometimes.

393
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:23,498
You get a headache.

394
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:34,872
In general, you have to forgive.

395
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:41,566
The third condition is very simple. You have to take out your shoes.

396
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:48,839
In England, first time I said please take out your shoes,

397
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,984
so half the people walked off.

398
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,977
You have been already told about the subtle centers

399
00:54:35,177 --> 00:54:39,128
and the channels that we have within ourselves.

400
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:50,353
So now we have two powers  left and right.

401
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:56,996
The left one is the power of desire,

402
00:54:57,196 --> 00:55:00,860
the right one is the power of action.

403
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:08,616
Is a mundane desire,

404
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:13,577
everyday desire.

405
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:21,314
Now, so those who are sitting on the chair,

406
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:23,617
not those who are sitting on the ground they are all right,

407
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:28,278
have to put both their feet apart from each other.

408
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:39,827
And put the left hand on your left lap, that's all.

409
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:48,018
And we have to nourish our centers with our right hand.

410
00:55:52,151 --> 00:55:57,248
Only for tonight we have to do, is not to be repeated.

411
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,226
Now we will show you what is to be done,

412
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:10,007
is to put the left hand like this, which symbolizes that

413
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:14,192
you desire to have your Self Realization.

414
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:27,157
All right. So please put the left hand like this.

415
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:35,525
Now the right hand you have to put it first on your heart

416
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:43,786
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

417
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:51,968
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide,

418
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:55,722
your own master.

419
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:01,666
So, we work only on the left-hand side.

420
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:04,119
Put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen

421
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,482
on the left-hand side.

422
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,805
This is the center of your mastery

423
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:20,267
created by great prophets and seers.

424
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,396
Now you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

425
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:33,346
on the left-hand side.

426
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:43,232
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine Knowledge.

427
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:49,884
Now you take your right hand to the upper portion

428
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:54,013
of your abdomen again.

429
00:57:57,152 --> 00:58:01,394
Then take it on your heart.

430
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:07,088
And then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

431
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:16,213
and turn your head to your right.

432
00:58:16,804 --> 00:58:23,148
This center is not all right. Please don't feel guilty.

433
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:35,009
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across like this

434
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:38,983
and bend your head slowly.

435
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:50,740
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

436
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:57,514
and push back your head.

437
00:58:59,029 --> 00:59:02,314
Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

438
00:59:02,514 --> 00:59:06,034
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine Power.

439
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:22,063
Now the last center is important. Stretch your palm as far as possible.

440
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:32,792
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area

441
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:37,445
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

442
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,004
Now push back your fingers as far as possible.

443
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:54,086
Now please put down your head.

444
00:59:55,328 --> 01:00:02,627
Here you have to move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

445
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:15,699
Please push back your fingers otherwise there will be no pressure.

446
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:24,410
And bend your heads please.

447
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:30,564
Please move it seven times.

448
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:36,470
That's all we have to do.

449
01:00:39,673 --> 01:00:43,950
Now we will start by closing our eyes.

450
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:49,455
Please don't open your eyes until and unless I tell you.

451
01:00:56,041 --> 01:01:00,688
Please put your feet apart from each other

452
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:05,232
and let hand on your left lap.

453
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:14,885
And put your right hand on your heart.

454
01:01:16,979 --> 01:01:21,726
You can take out your spectacles and close your eyes.

455
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:29,094
Please don't open till I tell you.

456
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:35,507
Here resides the Spirit.

457
01:01:35,707 --> 01:01:38,014
So you have to ask a fundamental question

458
01:01:38,214 --> 01:01:42,385
about yourself three times to Me.

459
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:54,428
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

460
01:01:57,764 --> 01:02:04,954
So please say it three times in your heart, "Mother", ask the question,

461
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:09,789
Mother, am I the Spirit?

462
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:24,697
I have told you already that if you become the Spirit,

463
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:29,666
you become your own guide, your own master.

464
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:37,482
So now please take your right hand in the upper portion

465
01:02:37,682 --> 01:02:43,977
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers.

466
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,229
Here you ask Me another question in your heart,

467
01:02:53,429 --> 01:02:57,858
very fundamental, about yourself.

468
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:10,684
Please ask, Mother, am I my own master?

469
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:22,343
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

470
01:03:22,543 --> 01:03:26,436
and I cannot force on you your Self Realization.

471
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:33,791
In the same way, I cannot force pure divine Knowledge on you.

472
01:03:44,473 --> 01:03:48,180
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion

473
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,748
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

474
01:03:56,959 --> 01:04:10,533
Here you have to say again I mean you have to ask six times

475
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:14,944
because the center has got six petals.

476
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:24,663
So ask six times,

477
01:04:24,863 --> 01:04:30,582
Mother, please give me pure divine Knowledge.

478
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:43,323
This is the knowledge about the science of divine Laws,

479
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:53,324
which you get spontaneously, automatically on your nerves.

480
01:04:57,286 --> 01:05:02,235
As soon as you ask the question for divine Knowledge,

481
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:06,849
the Kundalini starts rising upward.

482
01:05:11,098 --> 01:05:14,355
So you have to nourish the upper centers

483
01:05:14,556 --> 01:05:19,228
with your full self-confidence.

484
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:26,077
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

485
01:05:26,277 --> 01:05:31,480
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

486
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:44,732
Here you have to say ten times with full confidence,

487
01:05:44,932 --> 01:05:50,205
Mother, I am my own master.

488
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:05,152
I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind,

489
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:11,012
this intellect, these emotions, these conditionings, this ego,

490
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:15,537
but you are the pure Spirit.

491
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:28,216
So now raise your right hand on top of your heart

492
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:33,549
and here you have to say again with full self-confidence.

493
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:48,953
Say it will full confidence, Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

494
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:51,535
That you are, have faith in it and say it,

495
01:06:51,735 --> 01:06:56,234
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

496
01:07:04,023 --> 01:07:10,979
This all-pervading Power of divine Love

497
01:07:11,179 --> 01:07:20,880
is the ocean of knowledge and bliss.

498
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:33,568
It is the ocean of energy of compassion and love.

499
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:44,598
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

500
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:51,296
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

501
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:53,692
can be easily dissolved

502
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:59,955
by the power of this ocean of compassion and forgiveness.

503
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:11,570
You must have faith in yourself.

504
01:08:13,328 --> 01:08:18,321
So, forgive yourself and put your hand, right hand

505
01:08:18,521 --> 01:08:20,743
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

506
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:25,084
and turn your head to your right.

507
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:41,150
Now, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times,

508
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:47,367
Mother, I am not guilty at all. Have confidence.

509
01:08:56,797 --> 01:09:02,805
I have already told you that

510
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:08,399
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

511
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,125
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

512
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:25,428
and torture yourself.

513
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,138
Specially at this moment if you don't forgive,

514
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:30,799
the center of Agnya won't open and your Kundalini

515
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:35,358
will not be able to penetrate.

516
01:09:42,073 --> 01:09:44,935
So now raise your hand to your forehead across

517
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:50,814
and put down your head as far as possible.

518
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:04,259
Here you have to say again with self-confidence,

519
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:09,024
but not how many times from your heart,

520
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:19,624
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

521
01:10:27,804 --> 01:10:32,350
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

522
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,722
just for your satisfaction,

523
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:41,639
you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine Power.

524
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:58,188
So now please raise your right hand on the back side of your head

525
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:02,430
and push back your head as far as possible.

526
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:13,910
Here you have to say, again from your heart,

527
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:18,321
not how many times,

528
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:26,495
just for your justification,

529
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:33,598
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

530
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:43,784
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive them.

531
01:11:55,432 --> 01:11:58,615
Now the last center as I said is very important.

532
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:05,260
You have to stretch your palm fully and

533
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:12,220
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area,

534
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,162
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

535
01:12:32,204 --> 01:12:36,665
Now stretch back your fingers as far as possible

536
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:44,289
and please put down your head as far as possible.

537
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:52,502
With a pressure you have to move

538
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:58,015
your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

539
01:13:06,093 --> 01:13:09,432
Here again I cannot force Self Realization on you.

540
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:15,292
So you have to ask for it saying seven times while moving your hand,

541
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:20,078
Mother, please give me my Self Realization.

542
01:14:12,444 --> 01:14:17,569
Now please take down your hand.

543
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:23,340
Slowly open your eyes.

544
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,022
Put both the hands towards Me like this

545
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:34,190
and watch Me without thinking.

546
01:14:40,031 --> 01:14:43,917
Now put the right hand towards Me like this

547
01:14:44,117 --> 01:14:47,847
and put down your head, and with the left hand

548
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:53,214
try to see if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

549
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:57,938
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

550
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:16,802
Now, please put the left hand.

551
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:24,562
Also, bend your head, it is important.

552
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,808
Now again see with the right hand.

553
01:15:28,008 --> 01:15:31,972
Not on top of your head, away from your fontanelle bone.

554
01:15:32,172 --> 01:15:38,317
If there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming.

555
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:54,366
Sometimes they are cool, sometimes they are hot.

556
01:15:58,397 --> 01:16:02,498
They could be close or away.

557
01:16:03,482 --> 01:16:06,934
But if you have not forgiven yourself or others,

558
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:11,087
you get the hot breeze.

559
01:16:14,322 --> 01:16:20,732
So now again please try to forgive everyone, yourself also.

560
01:16:25,521 --> 01:16:30,772
Now please put again your right hand towards Me

561
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:35,143
and see with the left hand.

562
01:16:38,233 --> 01:16:41,127
You have to move your hand because sometimes it is far,

563
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:45,304
sometimes it is closer.

564
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:51,407
It is coming out of your fontanelle bone area,

565
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:56,052
so please have faith in yourself.

566
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:04,066
Please bend your head, bend your head, otherwise.

567
01:17:11,099 --> 01:17:15,540
Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

568
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,639
push back your head.

569
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:30,511
Now, here you can ask one of these three questions three times,

570
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:34,032
one of them.

571
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:46,135
The first one is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

572
01:17:50,508 --> 01:17:54,500
Ask three times.

573
01:17:55,312 --> 01:18:02,388
Second one is, Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love, Ruh?

574
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:12,766
The third one is, Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?

575
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:19,125
Ask any one of these three times.

576
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:28,490
This is the first time you are feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

577
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:36,639
Now please bring down your hands.

578
01:18:38,678 --> 01:18:43,748
All those who have felt

579
01:18:46,795 --> 01:18:53,789
cool breeze on the fingertips,

580
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:56,897
or may be hot,

581
01:18:57,098 --> 01:19:01,582
same on the palms

582
01:19:03,808 --> 01:19:11,128
or out of their fontanelle bone area,

583
01:19:14,995 --> 01:19:18,823
please raise both your hands.

584
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:26,061
What do you say to that?

585
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:30,371
I bow to you all.

586
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:39,668
Most of you have become saints now, so I bow to you.

587
01:19:46,837 --> 01:19:50,325
Please put down your hands.

588
01:19:50,525 --> 01:19:56,628
All those who have felt the cool breeze,

589
01:19:56,828 --> 01:20:03,460
this all-pervading Power of divine Love, have to grow into it.

590
01:20:10,421 --> 01:20:14,450
Some of you may not have felt.

591
01:20:17,044 --> 01:20:22,389
Maybe something physically, mentally wrong with you,

592
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:28,994
maybe spiritually.

593
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:33,350
Or maybe you are thinking too much.

594
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:39,063
Or maybe you did not forgive,

595
01:20:39,264 --> 01:20:43,634
you do not forgive yourself and others.

596
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:46,775
Whatever it is,

597
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:50,764
everything can be corrected.

598
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:57,136
Respect your Realization

599
01:21:00,566 --> 01:21:04,634
and grow into it.

600
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:09,126
Most surprising thing is that when I come,

601
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:14,959
so many of you come here and get your Realization.

602
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:25,614
But I am a foreigner, I am an Indian

603
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:31,788
and you trust Me so much.

604
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:38,822
But we have here very beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

605
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:51,608
They will not take any money and you can grow.

606
01:21:53,526 --> 01:21:57,409
They'll tell you all about it,

607
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,150
complete knowledge.

608
01:22:03,767 --> 01:22:11,658
So when I go away, you should not just give up, you have to grow.

609
01:22:15,955 --> 01:22:19,958
Otherwise, it would be like the parable of Christ that

610
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:25,961
some seeds fell on the barren land

611
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:31,934
and some on the marshy land which just sprouted and were finished.

612
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:45,371
It's a very great responsibility

613
01:22:46,773 --> 01:22:51,640
that you are born in this special time.

614
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:58,175
Then you have got your Realization.

615
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:02,186
And it's only you, the enlightened ones,

616
01:23:02,386 --> 01:23:05,834
who can save the world.

617
01:23:09,373 --> 01:23:14,298
Make the world beautiful for your children.

618
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:21,540
So please understand your own worth and value.

619
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,840
Now, please know your identity that

620
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,720
you have entered into the kingdom of God.

621
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:41,464
Life would be full of blessings.

622
01:23:43,057 --> 01:23:48,017
But please grow and give it to others.

623
01:23:52,252 --> 01:23:55,706
Have faith in yourself.

624
01:23:55,906 --> 01:24:01,359
My message is, now enjoy yourself and enjoy others.

625
01:24:04,869 --> 01:24:09,596
May God bless you all.

626
01:25:06,787 --> 01:25:11,662
Thank you very much. Thank you.
