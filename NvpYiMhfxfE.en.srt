00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:27,821
Public Program. Brasilia, Brazil, 1992-1015

2
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:33,770
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:45,437
We have to know that truth is what it is.

4
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:53,372
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,

5
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:58,941
we cannot read about it.

6
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:08,129
Also, unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot know it.

7
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:21,529
We have to become the Spirit.

8
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:29,634
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

9
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:34,092
you need not believe me blindfolded.

10
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:50,360
But keep your mind open as a scientist has.

11
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:59,660
Treat is as a hypothesis.

12
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:07,424
And if it turns to be the truth,

13
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:12,397
you have to accept it as honest people.

14
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:21,556
Because it is for the benevolence

15
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:28,739
of your own, benevolence of your country

16
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,017
and benevolence of the whole world.

17
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:43,563
We are born in a very special time today.

18
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,722
These are the times when lots of things are going to happen.

19
00:03:55,384 --> 00:04:00,020
And people will be in illusions,

20
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,869
won't understand what is right and what is wrong.

21
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:18,430
But at this time only, there are many who are seeking the truth.

22
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,880
They are not sticking on to any one book

23
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,919
or sticking on to one ideology.

24
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:36,150
But they want to know what is beyond.

25
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:47,262
They are a special category of people.

26
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:53,741
William Blake, a great poet, has said that

27
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:58,668
"Men of God will be born in those days.

28
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,335
And they will find their divinity

29
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:14,031
and they will make others divine."

30
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:27,180
Believe Me, you all have your divinity intact within yourself.

31
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:37,033
It cannot be tarnished,

32
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:42,788
it cannot be destroyed whatever you might have done to yourself.

33
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:51,125
Because it is eternal in nature.

34
00:05:54,235 --> 00:06:00,008
Only question is of manifesting this divinity

35
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:10,563
through your ascent into a new realm of reality.

36
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:19,911
You are all ready for it.

37
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:25,950
There is no more fasting or suffering needed.

38
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:34,958
There is no need to change you dress and you foods.

39
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:44,061
It is the internal happening that is important.

40
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:53,272
You have been already told about

41
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:58,183
the subtle system that works it out.

42
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:09,631
When this power called Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone,

43
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:15,230
awakens, She passes through six centers.

44
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:27,738
The Greeks perhaps knew it was a sacrum bone,

45
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,150
so they call it a sacrum.

46
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:43,891
And this is awaken just like a seed is sprouted,

47
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:53,014
because the seed has the built in quality to sprout.

48
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:02,832
All living process is spontaneous.

49
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:10,288
So there are two things we should know

50
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:14,566
when we are seeking the truth.

51
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:30,756
The first one is that you are not this body, this mind,

52
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:34,686
this ego, this conditioning,

53
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:39,183
but you are the pure Spirit.

54
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:54,091
The second truth is that there is an All Pervading Divine Power

55
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,924
which does all the living work.

56
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:11,366
You see these beautiful plants, it is a miracle.

57
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:19,310
But we take it for granted.

58
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,743
We have these eyes which are, which is a camera.

59
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:30,794
It is a miracle, but we take it for granted.

60
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:42,352
Then look at our brain, which is such a great computer,

61
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:46,583
but we take it for granted.

62
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:55,849
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

63
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:05,906
he will say it is the autonomous nervous system.

64
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:12,836
Now, who is this auto?

65
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:21,868
So there is some power which is working out all these living miracles.

66
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:30,130
So the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit

67
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:38,986
and the second one is that there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

68
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:52,858
We cannot feel it, we cannot see it, but it exists.

69
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,139
Now when this Power rises through these centers,

70
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,425
It nourishes those centers.

71
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:25,012
All human problems are because of these centers.

72
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:32,928
And if these centers are put right,

73
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:38,644
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems

74
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:43,173
can be solved.

75
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:53,688
It is as simple as that.

76
00:11:55,946 --> 00:12:01,308
Also I would like to tell you in short

77
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:06,102
what happens to your awareness.

78
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:15,793
When this Kundalini connects you to the mains

79
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:19,001
as this instrument when connected to the mains

80
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,946
has some meaning,

81
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:37,899
so you too have some meaning.

82
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:47,282
But it makes you stand in the present.

83
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,684
We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts

84
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:03,032
which are coming from the past or from the present.

85
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:16,944
But then when the Kundalini rises, She separates those thoughts

86
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:21,308
and the space in between is the present.

87
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,313
So you develop a new awareness

88
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,531
called as thoughtless awareness.

89
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,902
You are aware, fully aware,

90
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:50,219
but there is no thought in your mind to disturb you.

91
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:01,289
Thus you achieve peace within yourself.

92
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:09,885
There a many people who have got prices for peace,

93
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:14,444
but I am not seeing that peace within themselves.

94
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:29,216
So this peace within us is existing there, we become that peace.

95
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,495
And such a person emits peace

96
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:44,250
and neutralizes violence and anger.

97
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:58,965
Now the nature of the Spirit is that Spirit is the universal being.

98
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:07,996
We are also universal.

99
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:12,421
If you cut a part of your body,

100
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,218
you'll find every one has the same bone,

101
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:22,128
the same muscle, the same artery.

102
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:36,528
So we are all inside universal.

103
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:46,279
We laugh the same way, we smile the same.

104
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:54,432
The difference is just skin deep.

105
00:15:56,271 --> 00:16:01,294
That is also just to create variety,

106
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:05,737
otherwise it would have been boring.

107
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:15,996
But this universal like nature within us

108
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:22,478
is manifested when the light of the Spirit comes into our consciousness.

109
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:37,364
We transcend all the barriers of races, cast, community,

110
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,697
religion and nations.

111
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,816
In short, you become part and parcel of the whole.

112
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:05,295
Like the microcosm become the macrocosm.

113
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:12,227
But it is a becoming, it is not just a lecture

114
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,728
or telling something or a false certificate,

115
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:19,068
but is the becoming that is important.

116
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:33,132
And you develop a balance in your life.

117
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:40,874
Moreover you become innately righteous.

118
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:48,978
For example, you're maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

119
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,475
You can commit any sin.

120
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,685
But once you become the Spirit,

121
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:08,268
you become above everything that is wrong.

122
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:23,432
You get your sense of security and your power.

123
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,684
Sense of security and your power of love.

124
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:37,214
This power is flowing in you then.

125
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:45,210
With that power, you become extremely compassionate

126
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,442
and extremely dynamic.

127
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:58,320
But when the light of the Spirit comes into you attention,

128
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,731
your attention becomes enlightened

129
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:12,313
Whenever you put your attention, it acts.

130
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:22,954
the another great thing about the Spirit is that

131
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:27,834
It is the source of absolute knowledge.

132
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:37,951
Like you have ten children together, tie their eyes

133
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:42,791
ask them about somebody: "What is wrong with this person?"

134
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:56,107
Now, all your centers are in your hand reflected,

135
00:19:56,308 --> 00:20:01,782
sympathetic, five, six, seven centers.

136
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:10,212
They all will raise one finger like this.

137
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:22,548
Ask the gentleman: "Have you got heart trouble?"

138
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:31,084
He will say: "Hoe do you know?"

139
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:36,984
Because everyone will know the same thing.

140
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,034
As you all can see Me sitting here, that is all.

141
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:48,367
You see the same thing.

142
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:57,644
So then there are no dogmas, no theories, nothing of the kind,

143
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:01,906
but actually you see the reality.

144
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:13,200
Then who is going to quarrel?

145
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,317
How can there is difference of opinion,

146
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:25,176
There cannot be wars then at all.

147
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:35,239
But the Spirit is the ocean of joy.

148
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:43,118
And after you get your Self Realization,

149
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:47,935
you feel as if you are swimming in the ocean of joy.

150
00:21:56,786 --> 00:22:02,387
You get separated from your problems and you see them as a witness.

151
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:12,134
And then you can solve them much better.

152
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:19,798
Without getting involved into it or upset about it.

153
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:32,098
I am so very happy to be in Brazil, specially in Brasilia.

154
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:41,388
No doubt, this is a very spiritual place.

155
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:48,743
There are great seekers and one day this may become

156
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:53,865
the greatest spiritual nucleus for the whole world.

157
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,277
You can get your Realization in hardly ten minutes time.

158
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:18,877
In this short time, I cannot tell you all about it.

159
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,232
In this hall, say, there are so many lights

160
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:31,924
and only you put on the switch and you get the lights there.

161
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:42,574
Because it is all built in.

162
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,573
No use telling you about the history of electricity,

163
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:53,230
how it was brought to Brasilia, it is all boring.

164
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:04,751
So the best thing is to get your Realization.

165
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:11,243
I know you have some questions in your mind.

166
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:18,439
And I would love to answer them.

167
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:25,486
After your Self Realization, you may change your mind.

168
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:33,710
So why not get your Self Realization?

169
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:40,906
You can't pay for it.

170
00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:46,874
It is a living process of your evolution.

171
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:56,805
Without this happening, you can never be satisfied with yourself.

172
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:08,312
Anybody who ask money in the name of God is a hypocrite.

173
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:16,664
Because God doesn't understand money and banking.

174
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:24,539
It is the headache of human beings.

175
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:36,055
So now, I would say that you all can get your Self Realization.

176
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:47,844
But I cannot force on you because I respect your freedom.

177
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:56,888
Those who want to have can get it

178
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:02,886
and those who don't want to have, it cannot be.

179
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:15,418
Christ has said that "The meek will inherit the Earth."

180
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,535
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people

181
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:34,027
nor it is meant for people who are stupid.

182
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:43,144
It is meant for people who are truly seeking the truth.

183
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:54,267
So I will request people who do not want to have their Realization

184
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:58,498
should leave the hall.

185
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:10,650
It will be very kind. And also very civil on their part

186
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,170
not to stay here and watch others.

187
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:27,568
If you are sticking on to some sort of a ideology,

188
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:31,908
then also is difficult.

189
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:40,221
You must keep your mind open,

190
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,584
then it works.

191
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:50,674
So I said it won't take much time.

192
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,623
And leave about half a minute

193
00:27:55,823 --> 00:28:00,299
for you to leave with those who wants to leave.

194
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:19,272
Alright. Such a wonderful thing that no one wants to leave.

195
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,092
Alright.

196
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:28,824
So there are three conditions which are very simple.

197
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,752
The first condition is

198
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:44,299
that you all have to be absolutely self-confident

199
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:50,296
that you all will get your Self Realization tonight.

200
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:06,145
So the second one is follows that

201
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:10,628
you are not to condemn yourself for anything,

202
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:19,658
You have to forget the past.

203
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,650
And don't feel guilty at all.

204
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,466
If you have done committed some mistakes,

205
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:34,095
after all you are human begins, you are not gods.

206
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:45,707
And this All Pervading Power is a ocean of forgiveness.

207
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:54,523
So all your mistakes can be easily neutralized by that.

208
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:05,521
So please don't feel guilty.

209
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:13,721
If you feel guilty, it works against the center on the left-handed side,

210
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:17,726
this center on the left-handed side.

211
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:29,233
And you can get diseases like angina, like spondylitis,

212
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:33,847
could be lethargic organs.

213
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:47,406
And at this time, if the centers are blocked,

214
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,739
how will the Kundalini rises?

215
00:30:57,512 --> 00:30:59,512
So as they say in English language is the

216
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:03,561
pain in the neck, you see that.

217
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:06,973
...pain in the neck

218
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:20,307
So let's get rid of that pain in the neck.

219
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:29,003
In short, you should be very pleasantly placed

220
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:33,030
towards yourself.

221
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:43,457
Because you are glorious, you are magnificent.

222
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:52,073
You are fantastic.

223
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:56,569
Because you are not connected, you don't know what you are.

224
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:06,063
Like a, supposing in an Indian village I take a television

225
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:10,344
and tell them that you can see lots of films,

226
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:15,849
then he will say: "Oh, what is this box? How can you see films in this?"

227
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:31,680
But once you get it connected,

228
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,068
you can see what fantastic thing it is.

229
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,713
We also think about ourselves that we are just a box.

230
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,520
But you do not know how many powers there are within you.

231
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,612
So you should be very pleasantly placed

232
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:05,420
towards yourself.

233
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:12,726
Because now you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

234
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:19,432
That Kingdom of God is the most efficient,

235
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:26,555
is the most loving organization.

236
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:42,222
The third condition is even simpler that you have to forgive everyone.

237
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:53,158
Many people say is very difficult to forgive.

238
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,541
Logically, if you see,

239
00:33:57,758 --> 00:34:02,089
whether you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

240
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:09,933
You don't do anything.

241
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:15,009
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

242
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:22,833
Those who have troubled you and have tortured you are happy,

243
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:27,767
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

244
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:42,997
But also the center of optical chiasma is like that in the Agnya Chakra.

245
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:54,760
And this will never open unless and until you forgive.

246
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,603
So you have to forgive, otherwise this won't open like this.

247
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:12,005
As it is you are torturing yourself

248
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:17,076
all your life and now at this very important moment,

249
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:21,432
you will miss your Self Realization.

250
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:35,300
So just to forgive all of them, even don't think about them.

251
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:45,467
Even thinking about them is a headache.

252
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:52,639
So in your heart, you should forgive all of them in general.

253
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:01,935
These are the only three conditions.

254
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,046
First is that you should be fully self-confident

255
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,294
that you all will get your Realization.

256
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:21,481
The second one is that you are not guilty at all.

257
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:31,564
And the third one is we have to forgive everyone in general.

258
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:43,853
Now we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

259
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:07,429
Please sit inside otherwise, you have all to sit down.

260
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,679
Don't be standing, please.

261
00:37:20,227 --> 00:37:24,235
There is some room here, behind.

262
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:53,619
Now those who are sitting on the chairs, not on the ground,

263
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,714
have to put both their feet on both the sides

264
00:37:56,914 --> 00:38:01,781
because left and right are two different powers.

265
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:16,865
The left side power is the power of desire,

266
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:23,833
And the right side one is the power of action.

267
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,278
So now we put our left hand

268
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:34,317
on our lap very comfortably.

269
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:46,408
Someone has to come and show here.

270
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:53,189
And the right hand we use for nourishing our centers.

271
00:38:57,871 --> 00:39:01,923
The left hand suggests that you are desirous

272
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:07,486
of Self Realization, you have a strong desire to have Self Realization.

273
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:16,410
And the right one is for the action.

274
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:21,236
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

275
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:30,366
In the heart resides the Spirit.

276
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:43,004
So now if you become the Spirit, you become

277
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:48,462
in the light of the Spirit, your own guide, your own master.

278
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:02,240
So we take our hand in the upper portion of abdomen

279
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,010
on left hand side,

280
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:14,627
which is the center of our mastery.

281
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:23,373
Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of abdomen

282
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:27,276
on left hand side,

283
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:39,682
which is the center of pure knowledge of Divine Laws.

284
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:50,614
Then we raise again our right hand in the upper portion of abdomen.

285
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,613
Then on our heart.

286
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:02,703
Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

287
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:06,536
and turn our head to right.

288
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:17,254
I've already told you about this center that when you feel guilty,

289
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:21,259
it goes out of order.

290
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:32,363
Now we take our right hand and put it across our forehead

291
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:36,407
and put down our head.

292
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:48,555
This is the center to forgive everyone in general.

293
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:58,902
Now we take back our right hand on the back side of our head

294
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:03,797
and push back our head as far as possible.

295
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:15,847
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

296
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:20,050
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

297
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,125
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

298
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:36,210
Now the last center, you have to

299
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:41,060
stretch your palm fully.

300
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:50,671
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area

301
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:55,601
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

302
00:43:02,962 --> 00:43:06,493
Now please bend your head.

303
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,076
Very important is to push back your fingers,

304
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:15,244
so that there is a good pression on your scalp.

305
00:43:25,553 --> 00:43:35,037
Please now move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly.

306
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:47,928
Please put down your hands.

307
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:52,211
That is all we have to do now.

308
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,634
We have to now close our eyes

309
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:59,381
and please don't open them till I tell you.

310
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:09,960
You can take out your glasses.

311
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:18,757
Now, again, please put both feet apart from each other,

312
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:23,707
put left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

313
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:34,829
And now please close your eyes.

314
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:41,386
Here resides the Spirit,

315
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:46,474
so you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself.

316
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:51,620
You may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji.

317
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:08,017
Please ask Me three time in your heart: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

318
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:24,823
I already told you that if you are the Spirit,

319
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:29,187
you become your own master.

320
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,612
So now, please take your right hand

321
00:45:37,812 --> 00:45:41,960
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

322
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,508
You are working only on the left hand side.

323
00:45:53,406 --> 00:46:02,027
Here again you have to ask a fundamental question three times:

324
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:06,711
"Mother, am I my own master?"

325
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:21,551
Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom

326
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:29,043
and I cannot force the pure knowledge of Divine on you,

327
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:32,982
you have to ask for it.

328
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:43,148
So now you have to take your right hand

329
00:46:43,348 --> 00:46:45,748
in the lower portion of your abdomen

330
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:50,133
on the left hand side and press it and here

331
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,774
you have to ask six times,

332
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:57,368
because this center has got six petals.

333
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:05,833
Please say six time: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

334
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:35,872
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

335
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:39,281
your Kundalini starts rising.

336
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:49,300
So now you have to enrich your higher centers

337
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,508
with your full self-confidence.

338
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,538
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

339
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:18,098
on the left hand side and press it.

340
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:28,627
Here with full confidence, you have to say ten times:

341
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:33,506
"Mother, I am my own master."

342
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,859
I have already told you the fundamental truth about you

343
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:07,726
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

344
00:49:07,926 --> 00:49:12,192
but you are the pure Spirit.

345
00:49:22,398 --> 00:49:28,112
So now, please raise your right hand on top of your heart

346
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:34,706
and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times:

347
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:40,476
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

348
00:50:01,893 --> 00:50:09,190
This All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge.

349
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:23,940
It is the ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss.

350
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:32,498
It is the ocean of miracles.

351
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:37,604
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

352
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:43,826
And all your mistakes can be easily dissolve

353
00:50:44,026 --> 00:50:48,425
by this ocean of forgiveness.

354
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:55,798
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand

355
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:58,368
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

356
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:02,373
and turn your head to right.

357
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:18,042
Please turn it to right.

358
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:25,678
Now here you have to say with full self-confidence:

359
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:31,300
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

360
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:51,087
I've already told you that

361
00:51:51,287 --> 00:51:57,146
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

362
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:09,817
But if you don't forgive, the you play into wrong hands all your life.

363
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:17,004
And at this juncture, if you don't forgive,

364
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,567
your Agnya Chakra won't open

365
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:25,603
and the Kundalini will not be able to penetrate through it.

366
00:52:32,574 --> 00:52:37,171
So you have already tortured yourself all your life and now

367
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:41,957
at this great moment, you miss your Self Realization.

368
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,831
So now say in your heart,

369
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:55,917
not how many times, but from your heart:

370
00:52:56,117 --> 00:53:03,094
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Don't think about them.

371
00:53:23,807 --> 00:53:27,248
Now you have to take your hand on the back side of your head

372
00:53:27,448 --> 00:53:30,920
and push back your head as far as possible.

373
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,670
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

374
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:42,315
just for your satisfaction, you have to say,

375
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:01,287
say from your heart, not how many times:

376
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:09,345
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

377
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:14,194
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

378
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:37,768
Now, the last center, is very important,

379
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:42,226
we have to stretch our palm fully.

380
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:52,430
And now we have to put our center of our palm

381
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,973
on top of fontanel bone area.

382
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:07,457
Now stretch back your fingers, that's important.

383
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:14,527
And please put down your head as far as possible.

384
00:55:20,036 --> 00:55:32,561
Here I again cannot cross over your freedom.

385
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:48,312
Again you have to ask Me to give you Self Realization.

386
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:57,808
So now move your scalp slowly

387
00:55:58,009 --> 00:56:00,979
clockwise seven times saying:

388
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,883
"Mother, please give me Self Realization", seven times.

389
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:30,244
Please take down your hands.

390
00:57:32,525 --> 00:57:36,883
And open your eyes, please.

391
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:42,047
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

392
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:53,025
Like this, not like that.

393
00:57:54,197 --> 00:57:58,572
And watch Me without thinking.

394
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:05,176
Now bend your head and see with your left hand

395
00:58:05,377 --> 00:58:10,739
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

396
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:14,439
coming out of your own head.

397
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:29,830
Put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

398
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:38,009
Some people get it too far.

399
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:45,532
Now please put the left hand towards Me like this.

400
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,863
And bend your head and now see with your right hand

401
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:55,895
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

402
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:59,860
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

403
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:12,697
If it is warm or hot, it means you are not forgiving,

404
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:17,346
so please forgive.

405
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:27,018
I cannot forgive for you, you have to forgive yourself.

406
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,777
Now, please put right hand.

407
00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:39,048
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

408
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:49,012
And see with your left hand, if there's a cool breeze like waves

409
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:55,509
or hot or warm coming out of your fontanel bone area.

410
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:06,266
Now, please do it.

411
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:10,458
Put both the hands towards the sky.

412
01:00:13,763 --> 01:00:17,536
And push back your head.

413
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:26,396
Now, ask anyone of these three questions three times.

414
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:40,754
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

415
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:49,102
Or "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Love, Divine Love?"

416
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:59,229
Or "Is it Brahma Chaitanya."

417
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:03,792
Anyone of these questions, you can ask three times.

418
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:13,575
Now take down your hands.

419
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:23,901
Put your hands like this.

420
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:32,089
You can feel your silence within yourself.

421
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:42,975
Now, all those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

422
01:01:43,175 --> 01:01:46,615
or hot or warm breeze on their fingertips,

423
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:54,232
or the same on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

424
01:01:54,432 --> 01:01:58,893
please raise both your hands.

425
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:14,561
Please raise both.

426
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:18,839
That is Brasilia. May God Bless you.

427
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:25,808
I bow to you all. You all have started your saintly life.

428
01:02:31,363 --> 01:02:35,379
Every where, all of you have got it.

429
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:41,765
May God bless you all.

430
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:48,918
There is to be - it is to be understood that you have gone beyond your mind.

431
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:57,740
So don't argue and don't doubt.

432
01:03:01,052 --> 01:03:05,313
We have here a very good center for you,

433
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:10,560
where you must learn how to make this connection perfect.

434
01:03:18,388 --> 01:03:26,271
All the knowledge about your subtle system, everything you will know.

435
01:03:32,456 --> 01:03:37,838
But one should know that you can only grow in collectivity.

436
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:48,501
Supposing one nail is cut out of My body, it will never grow.

437
01:03:52,987 --> 01:03:59,115
So you have to be humble about it and you should, all of you,

438
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:02,940
master this art.

439
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:14,873
You will have the powers to raise the Kundalini of others and awaken them.

440
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:23,448
You can cure people, you can do so many things.

441
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,549
And for all this, you don't have to pay at all.

442
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:36,681
You don't have to be also obliged,

443
01:04:36,882 --> 01:04:41,182
because it is your own power it has worked it.

444
01:04:45,855 --> 01:04:50,121
It is your honest seeking it has worked out.

445
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:57,717
I will definitely come next year here again for a longer period.

446
01:04:57,918 --> 01:05:01,864
por um período mais longo.

447
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:09,740
I would love you all to grow into your wisdom

448
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:14,283
like a great tree of spirituality.

449
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:24,596
May God Bless you all.
