1994-10-15 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

2
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:49,810
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:07:54,482 --> 00:08:01,496
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

4
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:11,546
We cannot change it; we cannot transform it.

5
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,308
Also, unfortunately,

6
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:23,079
with this human awareness we cannot know it.

7
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:31,630
Can they hear, all of them? Ask them can they hear, all of them.

8
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:42,048
Yogini: He is saying that with the fan it is not helping,

9
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:45,277
All right, then put it off.

10
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:50,681
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

11
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:57,305
If you move the fan further away, it will be all right.

12
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:07,172
Better. It makes too much sound; fan was making too much sound.

13
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:20,938
So now we have to know that our awareness

14
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:27,845
is not sufficient enough to know the absolute Truth.

15
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:37,403
Actually, we don't know the absolute Truth.

16
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,451
That's why there is a problem.

17
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,055
Somebody says this is good. Somebody says that is good.

18
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:56,699
There is a quarrel, fight, arguments, and ultimately wars.

19
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:08,513
That means we have to evolve more.

20
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:16,948
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

21
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:21,437
you should not accept it blindfolded,

22
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:35,386
but accept it as a hypothesis.

23
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:44,778
And if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people.

24
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:53,801
Because it is for your benevolence,

25
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,809
for the benevolence of your family, your country,

26
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,157
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

27
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,274
At the very outset, I would like to tell you

28
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:22,641
that the truth is you are not this body, this mind,

29
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:31,935
these emotions, intellect, conditionings, or your ego.

30
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:46,185
But you are the pure Spirit.

31
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:54,740
There is another truth is, you see all these beautiful flowers

32
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,565
and we take them for granted.

33
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:08,671
Actually, it's a miracle.

34
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:13,752
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

35
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:18,248
so he will say, It is the autonomous nervous system.

36
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,249
But who is this auto?

37
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,109
Also, if you take to science you will find they cannot answer

38
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,748
all the questions because it has its own limitations.

39
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:50,738
For example, science cannot tell you why are you on this earth,

40
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:58,197
what is your identity.

41
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:02,593
So we take to religions.

42
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,824
But in the modern times, religions have become

43
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:11,039
money oriented or power oriented.

44
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:25,274
Also, it was great incarnations who came

45
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:30,825
like Christ, Mohammed Saab, Moses.

46
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:36,738
They were very great, pure incarnations

47
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,849
and they did not know what sort of people they were facing.

48
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:51,361
The way they were tortured and crucified.

49
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:03,648
They preached to people who cannot follow their followings,

50
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:08,180
they cannot follow their principles.

51
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:18,170
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter  Mathews

52
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,057
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take out the eye.

53
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:37,412
If your one hand does some sinful thing, you cut out the hand.

54
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:45,051
If somebody slaps you on this face, turn the other face.

55
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:54,208
I haven't seen any Christian without eye and without hands.

56
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:03,004
It's an impossible thing and very difficult.

57
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,434
It was easy for Christ to say that because He was so great.

58
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:21,659
Actually, you have to become a saint to follow His principles.

59
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:29,872
Ordinary people cannot follow Him.

60
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:36,133
Then I think Mohammed Saab thought that He was so strict

61
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:44,206
with the men, so He made lots of laws for the women also.

62
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:54,407
And so strict that any woman who looked at any man

63
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:57,743
with any lust, she should be buried halfway

64
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:02,056
and should be stoned.

65
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:13,299
Imagine what would have happened to American women.

66
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,863
So the principle of morality

67
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:28,063
was really too much for normal human beings.

68
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:39,208
Also, the Sharia which was brought in by Mohammed Saab

69
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:44,088
was given by Moses for the Jews.

70
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,228
In the Bible in the Old Testament, in the Jeremiah,

71
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:58,857
it is described clearly.

72
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,715
But Jews thought it was too much, so they didnt bother.

73
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:13,805
But Muslims think they can do it; I am sure they can't.

74
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,370
So, they believe they are Muslims, but they are not.

75
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:30,034
Christians believe they are Christians, but they are not.

76
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,477
First you have to become a saint.

77
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:40,865
You have to become an enlightened personality

78
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:48,061
so that automatically you become righteous, automatically.

79
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:56,524
In Sahaja Yoga, we dont have any punishments.

80
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:03,234
Here, we have to accept human beings as they are.

81
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:14,443
There are no confessions, and no physical or mental punishments.

82
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:23,910
At the most, we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:35,352
As this Power lies in the sacrum bone, it's your own.

84
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:45,711
She is your Mother, your individual Mother.

85
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:52,699
She knows all about you

86
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:57,688
and She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

87
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,098
It is in the real sense of the word

88
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:06,720
[that] you have to have your second birth.

89
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:14,925
It is not just a make-believe that you are twice born.

90
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,652
It becomes like any other brand like you are a Christian

91
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:27,977
or a Hindu or a Muslim or a twice born.

92
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:41,711
But anybody can commit any sin.

93
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,550
Anybody can commit any sin.

94
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:56,994
So one has to become innately righteous,

95
00:19:57,194 --> 00:20:01,553
innately moral.

96
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:11,677
It's only possible when you become the Spirit.

97
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:20,452
When this Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers

98
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,501
which are responsible for our physical, mental,

99
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:28,951
emotional, and spiritual being.

100
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:39,044
Thus, our physical being improves,

101
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:44,684
or sometimes absolutely in perfect condition.

102
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:54,078
In India there are four doctors from Delhi university

103
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:58,505
who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,485
Many incurable diseases can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:18,555
For diagnosis or for treatment, you don't have to go to hospitals

106
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:27,048
because you know self-knowledge.

107
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:31,420
You get self-knowledge

108
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:39,163
because you start feeling on your fingertips your own centers.

109
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:48,789
You start feeling this all-pervading Power on your fingertips.

110
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:56,311
So, this is the second truth that you have to know

111
00:21:56,511 --> 00:22:01,745
that there is an all-pervading Power of divine Love.

112
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:11,281
In the Koran, Mohammed Saab has clearly said that

113
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:14,053
when you will get your resurrection,

114
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:19,943
your hands, your fingers will know about you

115
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:24,839
and they will tell you about you.

116
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:38,943
This is the time of your resurrection.

117
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:48,956
I call it a blossom time, but in the Bible it is described as the last judgement.

118
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,026
You have to choose; you are free to choose.

119
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:59,628
If you want to go to hell, you can go.

120
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:04,039
If you want to go to heaven, you can go.

121
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:21,504
From the day you get your realization,

122
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:27,409
you start the transformation within yourself.

123
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:37,363
In the light of the Spirit, you become your own guide,

124
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:41,563
your own master.

125
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:48,844
You give up everything that is destructive.

126
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:59,235
You give up everything that is not for your progress.

127
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:06,109
All bad habits drop out automatically.

128
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:18,474
And these bad habits just remove all the diseases,

129
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:23,206
all the destructiveness from your body.

130
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:34,980
Its like this: if I am holding a snake, and there is darkness

131
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,612
and I cant see, and I am obstinate,

132
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:43,773
I am not going to believe if you tell me its a snake.

133
00:24:54,485 --> 00:25:01,673
And unless and until the snake bites, I won't give it up.

134
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,251
But if there is little light, even little light,

135
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:19,201
immediately I will throw away the snake on my own.

136
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:30,545
That is why enlightenment is the most important thing.

137
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,669
If you want to save the world,

138
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,481
it is important that we should take to our enlightenment

139
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:44,230
and give enlightenment to others.

140
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:53,218
As a result of this, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

141
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,535
devoid of lust and greed.

142
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:08,174
Innocence is an eternal thing,

143
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:13,001
but we have covered it with some clouds.

144
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:21,551
It is never destroyed,

145
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:28,442
and it comes back as soon as you get your enlightenment.

146
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,704
So your attention becomes not only innocent

147
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:40,591
but very powerful and active.

148
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:49,404
Wherever you put attention, it acts.

149
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:57,220
Such a person emits joy and peace.

150
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:07,304
Then you know the absolute Truth.

151
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:14,558
That means everybody knows the same truth.

152
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,794
Supposing if you have ten children who are realized souls

153
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:23,845
and tie their eyes, and ask them what is wrong with this person,

154
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:28,092
they will all lift the same fingers.

155
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,234
So in our awareness, a new dimension is created

156
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:47,900
called as vibratory awareness.

157
00:27:55,904 --> 00:28:00,320
Many people don't believe in God. But if you want to know,

158
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,343
you just put your hands and ask, Is there God?

159
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:09,088
And immediately you start getting tremendous cool breeze in your hands.

160
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:22,552
And if you, say, want to find out was Christ the son of God,

161
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:28,780
you just find out. And it is true because you get the cool breeze.

162
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:42,285
But if there is falsehood, if there is a false master,

163
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:45,164
you can immediately make it out because you get heat,

164
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:49,486
sometimes pins and needles.

165
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:02,517
Everybody knows the same.

166
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:13,825
Then the greatest thing that happens to you

167
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:18,938
[is] that you become collectively conscious.

168
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:29,397
Because you can feel the vibrations of another person,

169
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:35,737
and you can feel the chakras, the centers of another person also.

170
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:43,397
Then who is the other?

171
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:49,057
Like a microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

172
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:54,789
Microcosm becomes a macrocosm.

173
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:59,688
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

174
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:10,613
And such love, pure love and compassion flows in them.

175
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:22,064
Then you understand the value of another person also,

176
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:29,756
and also your own value.

177
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:35,217
But you become humble.

178
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:41,714
You can give realization to others. You can cure others.

179
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:52,136
That is how one enlightened light can enlighten other lights.

180
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,584
It's a natural process.

181
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,405
Just like a seed. If you put it in the Mother Earth,

182
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:04,573
it sprouts by itself.

183
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,558
Because in the seed it is built in to sprout

184
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:16,211
and it is in the Mother Earth the power is there to sprout.

185
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:27,511
This is how everything is built in within you.

186
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:34,717
It is spontaneous, means Sahaj.

187
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:39,875
Means it is born with you, this right to have this union, yoga,

188
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:44,075
with this divine Power.

189
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:53,638
When we think, we think about the past or the future.

190
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:58,519
We cannot be in the present which is the reality.

191
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:01,717
We think about the future and past,

192
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:06,073
and we cannot be in reality, which is the present.

193
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:18,624
Because the past is finished [and] the future doesn't exist.

194
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:27,299
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts

195
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:32,064
and establishes the silence in between them.

196
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:45,143
That time you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

197
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:53,485
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

198
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,944
You want to think, you can think. You don't want to think,

199
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,805
you need not think.

200
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:11,801
But inspirations start coming.

201
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:20,924
This state is the state of peace within yourself.

202
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:26,526
You become a witness of the whole drama,

203
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:31,609
and you become extremely peaceful within yourself.

204
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:40,152
There is no stress, there is no strain.

205
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:48,822
You become so free of all these things.

206
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:56,657
Actually, you become your own master.

207
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:09,331
Last of all, the greatest thing that happens to you

208
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:14,898
[is] that you jump into the ocean of joy.

209
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:29,355
When you are happy or unhappy, these are two sides of a coin.

210
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,523
When your ego is pampered, you are happy;

211
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:41,457
when it is punctured, you are unhappy.

212
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:51,867
But joy is singular.

213
00:34:53,617 --> 00:35:00,469
And it's a state in which you transcend all these limitations

214
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:04,770
of your conditionings.

215
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,937
For example, we have huge gatherings in India

216
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:18,292
of people who have become saints

217
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,690
and it is surprising [that] I have never seen them quarreling,

218
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,117
fighting, nothing of the kind.

219
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:40,390
It's a state in which you realize your importance,

220
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,809
your glory and the glory of others.

221
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:55,639
Its all your own.

222
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,922
It's all within you.

223
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:06,538
This power, what we call Kundalini, is in the sacrum bone

224
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:11,909
that means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

225
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:27,501
Now this power of yours is the power of pure desire.

226
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:34,253
All other desires are not pure.

227
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:39,873
Today we ask for a house, we get it. Then we try to get a car,

228
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,629
then we want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane

229
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:47,133
I mean there is no end to it.

230
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:53,642
It is not satiable.

231
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:56,861
In general, they say, wants are not satiable.

232
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:01,073
Economics says so.

233
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:08,014
So whether you are aware or not aware,

234
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:14,599
this power of pure desire in within you.

235
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:23,905
And once you get connected with this all-pervading Power,

236
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:28,386
all your problems get solved.

237
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:34,577
Even economic

238
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:37,937
[and] political.

239
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:44,426
Because most of the world problems come from human beings.

240
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:49,891
And all the human problems come from these chakras,

241
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:54,163
from these centers.

242
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:58,307
If these centers are somehow or other corrected,

243
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:03,549
the whole world can be a beautiful place to live in.

244
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:13,950
By talking about peace or having organizations of peace,

245
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,017
you cannot have peace.

246
00:38:21,484 --> 00:38:24,113
I have known people who have got awards in peace

247
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:29,414
and [are] absolutely very hot tempered, very.

248
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,240
They never even smile. They never even smile.

249
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:47,600
And if you have to approach them, it is better to go through a barge pole.

250
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:54,633
I dont know how they get peace awards.

251
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,633
You have to have peace within.

252
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:11,407
In this short lecture I dont think I can tell you everything about it.

253
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:20,526
But like in this beautiful hall you have so many lights.

254
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,759
Only you have to switch on, thats all.

255
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:34,034
But if I go on telling you about the history of this electricity,

256
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:39,250
how it came here, it is so boring.

257
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:48,486
So why not get it, enlightenment?

258
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,796
It is so easy.

259
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:59,269
You cant pay for it, you must understand this.

260
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:05,971
God doesn't understand money.

261
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:10,600
He doesn't understand banking that's our headache.

262
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:19,522
I don't know how people can sell God in the market.

263
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:28,691
Its all right [that] you can pay for this hall, all right.

264
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:32,516
But not for your Realization.

265
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:47,429
It will hardly take 15 minutes for you to get your Realization.

266
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:55,175
You are feeling warm, but after that you will feel very cool.

267
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:04,284
But as I said, I cannot force on you.

268
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:10,522
If you don't want, I cannot do it.

269
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:17,391
So those who do not want to have, have to go out.

270
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:25,755
It is not mental; it is beyond the mind.

271
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:31,117
So even My lecture is just an introduction,

272
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:35,642
but it is not the happening.

273
00:41:40,939 --> 00:41:45,291
Happening is the actualization,

274
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,627
I would say the actualization of your baptism.

275
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:57,920
It's the experience, it is not just talking.

276
00:41:58,662 --> 00:42:03,314
And you all can have this experience,

277
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:07,836
not at all difficult.

278
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:15,591
You dont have to think about it, just it will work automatically.

279
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:24,427
There is no problem of any kind that you will face.

280
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:34,374
I feel Brazil can do very well in Sahaja Yoga

281
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,652
because people are faithful and simple-hearted.

282
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:53,602
As in Russia I found they have no conditioning of any kind.

283
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:04,695
At least 65 to 70% people are very sensitive to spirituality.

284
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:12,479
The rest are stupid I must say.

285
00:43:13,196 --> 00:43:17,029
They are taking to American culture of Coca-Cola and all that.

286
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:21,939
They want Marlboro cigarettes.

287
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:32,727
In Russia, in one place called Togliatti,

288
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:38,216
we have got about 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

289
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:48,324
And also the government is very good there, I mean the universities.

290
00:43:48,524 --> 00:43:54,618
They have thrown away all other false gurus from there, everyone.

291
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,127
Surprisingly, they awarded Me

292
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:05,623
the award of the St. Petersburg university,

293
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:10,058
which was the oldest university,

294
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:20,599
as the honorary academician which were only ten so far.

295
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:24,408
I am the tenth.

296
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:30,516
And one of them is Einstein.

297
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,579
One of them is Enstein.

298
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,034
I was quite surprised, you know. So I said,

299
00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:47,259
Why do you include Me with Einstein? He was such a great scientist.

300
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:54,565
So they said that, Mother, what Einstein has done

301
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:57,299
is only on the matter. You are working on human beings.

302
00:44:57,499 --> 00:45:02,137
So they have given Me such a high award.

303
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:11,990
I said, I am not doing anything. Actually, they have their own powers,

304
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,011
and they are getting awakened to it. What am I doing about it?

305
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:17,940
I don't know.

306
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:28,551
But they are very sensitive people. There were 2000 scientists

307
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:37,649
in that conference.

308
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,817
They dont have much conditionings.

309
00:45:41,017 --> 00:45:45,110
I think they are people who are like clean slate.

310
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:48,229
- Like? - Like clean slate,

311
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:52,654
Clean slate, on which we write, clean slate.

312
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:05,112
And it has worked really wonders there.

313
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:13,065
So, I would request those who do not want to have

314
00:46:13,265 --> 00:46:15,362
their Self Realization should leave the hall

315
00:46:15,562 --> 00:46:20,054
because it is not proper to disturb in-between.

316
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:31,369
But after Realization,

317
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:43,820
one should not sort of get dissolved into that and do not grow.

318
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:58,520
Because it is in the beginning you will feel really on top of the world.

319
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:04,789
But you have to grow.

320
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:11,286
You have to grow in the collective.

321
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:16,916
You cannot grow in your houses or your homes, or in your rooms.

322
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:24,256
But you don't have to give up anything.

323
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:30,858
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your heads

324
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:37,538
or go to Gobi Desert to get nirvana.

325
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:44,984
Here, on your seats, you will get your Realization.

326
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:53,833
Don't have to give up your family, don't have to give up anything.

327
00:47:56,966 --> 00:48:01,138
You don't have to change your dress or anything.

328
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:09,423
In Chicago I met a gentleman, the head of the Hare Rama.

329
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:19,279
He was wearing a dhoti, what we wear in India, a dhoti.

330
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:29,630
Specially that day it was very cold in Chicago.

331
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:36,314
I said, Why do you wear a dhoti in this cold? Its terribly cold.

332
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:40,576
As a mother, I feel concerned.

333
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:49,639
He said, My guru has initiated me like this.

334
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:55,712
I said, Do you think that by wearing this dhoti

335
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:59,912
you will get your nirvana?

336
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:07,030
80% people in India wear dhotis and go on saying,

337
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,479
Hare Rama, hare Krishna. Are they all going to get nirvana?

338
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:25,802
I mean if they all go to heaven, where will you be?

339
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:35,012
It is the internal change that is needed, not outward.

340
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,492
I think you all are intelligent people, and you will understand

341
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:44,931
what I am saying.

342
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,395
We don't have any organization.

343
00:49:51,595 --> 00:49:54,519
We don't have any priesthood. We have no hierarchies.

344
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,397
Nothing of the kind. Everybody is equally the same.

345
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:06,843
I have no secretary. I travel every day, practically.

346
00:50:07,043 --> 00:50:10,994
Tomorrow I am going to Sao Paulo and then I am going to other places.

347
00:50:11,194 --> 00:50:15,368
Everyday practically I am travelling.

348
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:25,197
But I don't think I am travelling. I don't think.

349
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:31,857
I will be 72 years of age [but] I dont feel tired.

350
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:42,186
I am the same because I feel tremendous love for all of you.

351
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:49,596
That compels Me to travel.

352
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:58,345
And that love itself is so nourishing

353
00:51:01,314 --> 00:51:04,514
and so joy giving.

354
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:08,776
Same thing you all can have.

355
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:13,519
You all can have the same powers.

356
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:19,119
These are your potential things which you must get.

357
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:39,258
Now, this mother Kundalini, She knows everything about you.

358
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:44,247
Like a tape recorder, She has taped everything. She knows you.

359
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:53,315
She knows what mistakes you have committed,

360
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:58,032
She knows what are your aspirations, She knows you.

361
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,932
So please dont judge yourself.

362
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:15,211
She knows and She is anxious to give you your second birth.

363
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:21,988
So just understand

364
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:29,690
that you should not feel at all in any way diffident.

365
00:52:35,547 --> 00:52:39,829
You must have complete respect for yourself.

366
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:47,231
That means you should not feel guilty at all.

367
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,420
This is the first condition that

368
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:57,262
please don't feel guilty about anything that has happened in the past.

369
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,845
Past is finished, we are in the present.

370
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,694
So this is a very important condition because if you feel guilty,

371
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:20,144
the center on the left-hand side is in jeopardy.

372
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:36,260
So you may get Spondylitis, you may get Angina,

373
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,272
you may get Tuberculosis

374
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:50,004
or, could be, lethargic organs.

375
00:53:51,168 --> 00:53:53,440
So what is the use of feeling guilty

376
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,078
and troubling yourself like this?

377
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:09,548
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone

378
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:13,737
even without thinking about them.

379
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:19,737
As this center is caught up,

380
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:23,635
the Kundalini cannot rise above this center.

381
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:35,311
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

382
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:39,624
It is a myth.

383
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:42,329
Because if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

384
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,490
and torture yourself.

385
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:52,956
Specially at this moment.

386
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:58,573
The center on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted.

387
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:09,629
And if you don't forgive, it won't open out.

388
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:13,483
And at this moment,

389
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:16,858
you will miss the great opportunity of Self Realization

390
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:21,901
because Kundalini won't be able to pass through that center.

391
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:29,916
Also, don't think about people whom you have to forgive

392
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:37,176
because it is a very painful, I think, sometimes.

393
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,798
You get a headache.

394
00:55:48,164 --> 00:55:52,172
In general, you have to forgive.

395
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:58,866
The third condition is very simple. You have to take out your shoes.

396
00:56:03,158 --> 00:56:06,139
In England, first time I said please take out your shoes,

397
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:10,284
so half the people walked off.

398
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,277
You have been already told about the subtle centers

399
00:56:52,477 --> 00:56:56,428
and the channels that we have within ourselves.

400
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:07,653
So now we have two powers  left and right.

401
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:14,296
The left one is the power of desire,

402
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:18,160
the right one is the power of action.

403
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:25,916
Is a mundane desire,

404
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:30,877
everyday desire.

405
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:38,614
Now, so those who are sitting on the chair,

406
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:40,917
not those who are sitting on the ground they are all right,

407
00:57:41,117 --> 00:57:45,578
have to put both their feet apart from each other.

408
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:57,127
And put the left hand on your left lap, that's all.

409
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:05,318
And we have to nourish our centers with our right hand.

410
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:14,548
Only for tonight we have to do, is not to be repeated.

411
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,526
Now we will show you what is to be done,

412
00:58:23,726 --> 00:58:27,307
is to put the left hand like this, which symbolizes that

413
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:31,492
you desire to have your Self Realization.

414
00:58:39,925 --> 00:58:44,457
All right. So please put the left hand like this.

415
00:58:47,996 --> 00:58:52,825
Now the right hand you have to put it first on your heart

416
00:58:56,164 --> 00:59:01,086
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

417
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:09,268
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide,

418
00:59:09,468 --> 00:59:13,022
your own master.

419
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:18,966
So, we work only on the left-hand side.

420
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,419
Put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen

421
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:25,782
on the left-hand side.

422
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,105
This is the center of your mastery

423
00:59:33,305 --> 00:59:37,567
created by great prophets and seers.

424
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,696
Now you take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

425
00:59:46,896 --> 00:59:50,646
on the left-hand side.

426
00:59:54,508 --> 01:00:00,532
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine Knowledge.

427
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:07,184
Now you take your right hand to the upper portion

428
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:11,313
of your abdomen again.

429
01:00:14,452 --> 01:00:18,694
Then take it on your heart.

430
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:24,388
And then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

431
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:33,513
and turn your head to your right.

432
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:40,448
This center is not all right. Please don't feel guilty.

433
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:52,309
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across like this

434
01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:56,283
and bend your head slowly.

435
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:08,040
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

436
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:14,814
and push back your head.

437
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:19,614
Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

438
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:23,334
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine Power.

439
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:39,363
Now the last center is important. Stretch your palm as far as possible.

440
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:50,092
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area

441
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:54,745
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

442
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,304
Now push back your fingers as far as possible.

443
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:11,386
Now please put down your head.

444
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:19,927
Here you have to move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

445
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:32,999
Please push back your fingers otherwise there will be no pressure.

446
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:41,710
And bend your heads please.

447
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:47,864
Please move it seven times.

448
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,770
That's all we have to do.

449
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:01,250
Now we will start by closing our eyes.

450
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:06,755
Please don't open your eyes until and unless I tell you.

451
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:17,988
Please put your feet apart from each other

452
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:22,532
and let hand on your left lap.

453
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:32,185
And put your right hand on your heart.

454
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:39,026
You can take out your spectacles and close your eyes.

455
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:46,394
Please don't open till I tell you.

456
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:52,807
Here resides the Spirit.

457
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:55,314
So you have to ask a fundamental question

458
01:03:55,514 --> 01:03:59,685
about yourself three times to Me.

459
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:11,728
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

460
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:22,254
So please say it three times in your heart, "Mother", ask the question,

461
01:04:22,455 --> 01:04:27,089
Mother, am I the Spirit?

462
01:04:38,892 --> 01:04:41,997
I have told you already that if you become the Spirit,

463
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:46,966
you become your own guide, your own master.

464
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:54,782
So now please take your right hand in the upper portion

465
01:04:54,982 --> 01:05:01,277
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers.

466
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:10,529
Here you ask Me another question in your heart,

467
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:15,158
very fundamental, about yourself.

468
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:27,984
Please ask, Mother, am I my own master?

469
01:05:35,296 --> 01:05:39,643
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

470
01:05:39,843 --> 01:05:43,736
and I cannot force on you your Self Realization.

471
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:51,091
In the same way, I cannot force pure divine Knowledge on you.

472
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:05,480
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion

473
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,048
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

474
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:27,833
Here you have to say again I mean you have to ask six times

475
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:32,244
because the center has got six petals.

476
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:41,963
So ask six times,

477
01:06:42,163 --> 01:06:47,882
Mother, please give me pure divine Knowledge.

478
01:06:54,858 --> 01:07:00,623
This is the knowledge about the science of divine Laws,

479
01:07:05,406 --> 01:07:10,624
which you get spontaneously, automatically on your nerves.

480
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:19,535
As soon as you ask the question for divine Knowledge,

481
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:24,149
the Kundalini starts rising upward.

482
01:07:28,398 --> 01:07:31,655
So you have to nourish the upper centers

483
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:36,528
with your full self-confidence.

484
01:07:41,062 --> 01:07:43,377
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

485
01:07:43,577 --> 01:07:48,780
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

486
01:07:55,762 --> 01:08:02,032
Here you have to say ten times with full confidence,

487
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:07,505
Mother, I am my own master.

488
01:08:15,995 --> 01:08:22,452
I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind,

489
01:08:22,652 --> 01:08:28,312
this intellect, these emotions, these conditionings, this ego,

490
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:32,837
but you are the pure Spirit.

491
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:45,516
So now raise your right hand on top of your heart

492
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:50,849
and here you have to say again with full self-confidence.

493
01:08:58,188 --> 01:09:06,253
Say it will full confidence, Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

494
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:08,835
That you are, have faith in it and say it,

495
01:09:09,035 --> 01:09:13,534
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.

496
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:28,279
This all-pervading Power of divine Love

497
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:38,180
is the ocean of knowledge and bliss.

498
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:50,868
It is the ocean of energy of compassion and love.

499
01:09:54,541 --> 01:10:01,898
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

500
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:08,596
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

501
01:10:08,796 --> 01:10:10,992
can be easily dissolved

502
01:10:11,193 --> 01:10:17,255
by the power of this ocean of compassion and forgiveness.

503
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,870
You must have faith in yourself.

504
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:35,621
So, forgive yourself and put your hand, right hand

505
01:10:35,821 --> 01:10:38,043
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

506
01:10:38,243 --> 01:10:42,384
and turn your head to your right.

507
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:58,450
Now, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times,

508
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:04,667
Mother, I am not guilty at all. Have confidence.

509
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:20,105
I have already told you that

510
01:11:20,305 --> 01:11:25,699
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

511
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:34,425
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

512
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:42,728
and torture yourself.

513
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:45,438
Specially at this moment if you don't forgive,

514
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:48,099
the center of Agnya won't open and your Kundalini

515
01:11:48,299 --> 01:11:52,658
will not be able to penetrate.

516
01:11:59,373 --> 01:12:02,235
So now raise your hand to your forehead across

517
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:08,114
and put down your head as far as possible.

518
01:12:16,887 --> 01:12:21,559
Here you have to say again with self-confidence,

519
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,324
but not how many times from your heart,

520
01:12:31,949 --> 01:12:36,924
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

521
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:49,650
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

522
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,022
just for your satisfaction,

523
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,939
you have to ask forgiveness from this all-pervading divine Power.

524
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:15,488
So now please raise your right hand on the back side of your head

525
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:19,730
and push back your head as far as possible.

526
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:31,210
Here you have to say, again from your heart,

527
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:35,621
not how many times,

528
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:43,795
just for your justification,

529
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:50,898
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

530
01:13:53,929 --> 01:14:01,084
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive them.

531
01:14:12,732 --> 01:14:15,915
Now the last center as I said is very important.

532
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:22,560
You have to stretch your palm fully and

533
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,520
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area,

534
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,462
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

535
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:53,965
Now stretch back your fingers as far as possible

536
01:14:57,456 --> 01:15:01,589
and please put down your head as far as possible.

537
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:09,802
With a pressure you have to move

538
01:15:10,002 --> 01:15:15,315
your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

539
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:26,732
Here again I cannot force Self Realization on you.

540
01:15:26,932 --> 01:15:32,592
So you have to ask for it saying seven times while moving your hand,

541
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:37,378
Mother, please give me my Self Realization.

542
01:16:29,744 --> 01:16:34,869
Now please take down your hand.

543
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:40,640
Slowly open your eyes.

544
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:45,322
Put both the hands towards Me like this

545
01:16:47,678 --> 01:16:51,490
and watch Me without thinking.

546
01:16:57,331 --> 01:17:01,217
Now put the right hand towards Me like this

547
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:05,147
and put down your head, and with the left hand

548
01:17:05,347 --> 01:17:10,514
try to see if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

549
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:15,238
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

550
01:17:28,923 --> 01:17:34,102
Now, please put the left hand.

551
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:41,862
Also, bend your head, it is important.

552
01:17:42,901 --> 01:17:45,108
Now again see with the right hand.

553
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:49,272
Not on top of your head, away from your fontanelle bone.

554
01:17:49,472 --> 01:17:55,617
If there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming.

555
01:18:05,104 --> 01:18:11,666
Sometimes they are cool, sometimes they are hot.

556
01:18:15,697 --> 01:18:19,798
They could be close or away.

557
01:18:20,782 --> 01:18:24,234
But if you have not forgiven yourself or others,

558
01:18:24,434 --> 01:18:28,387
you get the hot breeze.

559
01:18:31,622 --> 01:18:38,032
So now again please try to forgive everyone, yourself also.

560
01:18:42,821 --> 01:18:48,072
Now please put again your right hand towards Me

561
01:18:48,272 --> 01:18:52,443
and see with the left hand.

562
01:18:55,533 --> 01:18:58,427
You have to move your hand because sometimes it is far,

563
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:02,604
sometimes it is closer.

564
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:08,707
It is coming out of your fontanelle bone area,

565
01:19:08,907 --> 01:19:13,352
so please have faith in yourself.

566
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:21,366
Please bend your head, bend your head, otherwise.

567
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,840
Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

568
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,939
push back your head.

569
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:47,811
Now, here you can ask one of these three questions three times,

570
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:51,332
one of them.

571
01:19:57,161 --> 01:20:03,435
The first one is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

572
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:11,800
Ask three times.

573
01:20:12,612 --> 01:20:19,688
Second one is, Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of divine Love, Ruh?

574
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:30,066
The third one is, Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?

575
01:20:32,355 --> 01:20:36,425
Ask any one of these three times.

576
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:45,790
This is the first time you are feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

577
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:53,939
Now please bring down your hands.

578
01:20:55,978 --> 01:21:01,048
All those who have felt

579
01:21:04,095 --> 01:21:11,089
cool breeze on the fingertips,

580
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:14,197
or may be hot,

581
01:21:14,398 --> 01:21:18,882
same on the palms

582
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:28,428
or out of their fontanelle bone area,

583
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:36,123
please raise both your hands.

584
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:43,361
What do you say to that?

585
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:47,671
I bow to you all.

586
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:56,968
Most of you have become saints now, so I bow to you.

587
01:22:04,137 --> 01:22:07,625
Please put down your hands.

588
01:22:07,825 --> 01:22:13,928
All those who have felt the cool breeze,

589
01:22:14,128 --> 01:22:20,760
this all-pervading Power of divine Love, have to grow into it.

590
01:22:27,721 --> 01:22:31,750
Some of you may not have felt.

591
01:22:34,344 --> 01:22:39,689
Maybe something physically, mentally wrong with you,

592
01:22:42,361 --> 01:22:46,294
maybe spiritually.

593
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:50,650
Or maybe you are thinking too much.

594
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,363
Or maybe you did not forgive,

595
01:22:56,564 --> 01:23:00,934
you do not forgive yourself and others.

596
01:23:01,134 --> 01:23:04,075
Whatever it is,

597
01:23:04,275 --> 01:23:08,064
everything can be corrected.

598
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:14,436
Respect your Realization

599
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:21,934
and grow into it.

600
01:23:22,134 --> 01:23:26,426
Most surprising thing is that when I come,

601
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:32,259
so many of you come here and get your Realization.

602
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:42,914
But I am a foreigner, I am an Indian

603
01:23:45,315 --> 01:23:49,088
and you trust Me so much.

604
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:56,122
But we have here very beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

605
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:08,908
They will not take any money and you can grow.

606
01:24:10,826 --> 01:24:14,709
They'll tell you all about it,

607
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:20,450
complete knowledge.

608
01:24:21,067 --> 01:24:28,958
So when I go away, you should not just give up, you have to grow.

609
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:37,258
Otherwise, it would be like the parable of Christ that

610
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:43,261
some seeds fell on the barren land

611
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:49,234
and some on the marshy land which just sprouted and were finished.

612
01:24:58,905 --> 01:25:02,671
It's a very great responsibility

613
01:25:04,073 --> 01:25:08,940
that you are born in this special time.

614
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:15,475
Then you have got your Realization.

615
01:25:16,468 --> 01:25:19,486
And it's only you, the enlightened ones,

616
01:25:19,686 --> 01:25:23,134
who can save the world.

617
01:25:26,673 --> 01:25:31,598
Make the world beautiful for your children.

618
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:38,840
So please understand your own worth and value.

619
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,140
Now, please know your identity that

620
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,020
you have entered into the kingdom of God.

621
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:58,764
Life would be full of blessings.

622
01:26:00,357 --> 01:26:05,317
But please grow and give it to others.

623
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:13,006
Have faith in yourself.

624
01:26:13,206 --> 01:26:18,659
My message is, now enjoy yourself and enjoy others.

625
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:26,896
May God bless you all.

626
01:27:24,087 --> 01:27:28,962
Thank you very much. Thank you.
