1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:24,840
Today you have arranged this worship of your 
Guru, that is your Mother.

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:38,410
Perhaps you are very unique people that have 
a Guru who is a Mother.

3
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:46,890
Why this Puja is arranged?

4
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:58,060
One has to know that it is very important 
for every disciple to worship the Guru, but

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:08,570
the Guru has to be a real Guru, not a one 
who is just exploiting the disciples and who

6
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,990
is not authorized by God.

7
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:33,200
The Puja is arranged because you have been 
initiated into the Statutes of the Lord.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:45,310
You have been told what are the dharmas of 
a human being.

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,420
For that actually you need not have a guru.

10
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:57,260
You can read any book and you will know what 
are the Statutes of the Lord.

11
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:09,090
But guru has to see that you practice them.

12
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:24,060
These Statutes are to be practiced, to be 
brought into your own life, which is a difficult

13
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,060
thing.

14
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:34,530
And without a guru, a correcting force, it 
is very difficult to follow these Statutes

15
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:42,560
of Lord, because there is a gap between human 
awareness and Divine awareness, a very big

16
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:53,080
gap, and that gap can be only fulfilled by 
a guru who himself is complete.

17
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,820
Today is a purnima day, “purnima” means 
the complete moon.

18
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:11,190
The guru has to be a complete personality 
to talk about these Statutes and to elevate

19
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,020
his disciples to this level of understanding, 
by which they imbibe those Statutes.

20
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:33,379
He is there to fulfill this gap, and for that 
it is essential that every guru has to be

21
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:42,370
a realized soul of a very high quality and 
greatly evolved.

22
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:52,379
He need not be a person who is an ascetic, 
or he need not be a person who is living in

23
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,379
the forest.

24
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:06,970
He could be a common householder, he could 
be a king.

25
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:16,810
All these outward manifestations of one’s 
life do not matter.

26
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:28,310
Whatever may be your position, I would say 
the so-called position in this world makes

27
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:39,970
no difference to your being a guru, as long 
as you have imbibed the Statutes of the Lord.

28
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:47,570
Again, I say you have to imbibe the Statutes.

29
00:04:47,570 --> 00:05:00,590
Let’s see what are the Statutes.

30
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:12,410
First is, you do not harm anyone.

31
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,400
First principle is that we are not to harm 
anyone.

32
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,440
Animals do harm without knowing that they 
are doing harm.

33
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,860
If you go near a snake, he’ll bite.

34
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,880
If a scorpion is there he can put his poison 
into your being.

35
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:47,270
Animals [should be:”Human beings”] are 
not to harm anyone; they can correct but not

36
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,710
harm.

37
00:05:48,710 --> 00:06:11,410
So the principle of not harming was taken 
to a very, very.

38
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,410
.

39
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:19,310
to a point where reality disappeared.

40
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,130
For example, when it was said “Do not harm 
anyone”, so people started saying: “All

41
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,970
right, we’ll not harm mosquitoes, we’ll 
not harm bugs.

42
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,210
We’ll not kill them.

43
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,740
” And there are some people who are following 
religions in which they preserve mosquitoes

44
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,080
and bugs.

45
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,199
This is absurdity!

46
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:53,000
Taking anything to absurdity cannot be reality.

47
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:09,810
First of all, we should not harm anyone who 
is walking in the path of God, the one who

48
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:20,880
is a realized soul.

49
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,419
He may be wrong, there may be some mistakes 
in him, still he needs correction; nobody’s

50
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,990
perfect as yet.

51
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,710
So do not harm, always try to help.

52
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:43,840
Secondly, anybody who is a real seeker, he 
may be wrong, he might have gone to wrong

53
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,660
gurus, he might have done wrong things; but 
have feelings, because you have been going

54
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:03,460
on the wrong path yourself sometimes; you 
have been misled before, so have more sympathies.

55
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,620
That’s why, if you have done mistakes, in 
a way is good because you have more sympathies

56
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,770
for such people.

57
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:23,150
Then you are not to harm human beings in any 
way.

58
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:40,919
You are not to cause them any bodily harm, 
any emotional upsetting just for harm’s

59
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:51,170
sake; for correction it’s all right.

60
00:08:51,170 --> 00:09:04,950
The second Statute is that you have to stand 
on your own legs and know that you are here,

61
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:17,670
one with the truth, the testimony, the testimony 
of the truth: that you have seen the truth,

62
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:25,300
you know what truth is, and you cannot compromise 
with falsehood, you cannot.

63
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:36,800
For that you need not harm anyone, you have 
to just profess it.

64
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:46,019
You have to stand up and say that you have 
seen the truth and this is the truth, and

65
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:55,912
you have to be one with it, so that people 
see that light of truth in you and they accept

66
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,769
you.

67
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:03,769
It’s not for telling others that: “You 
have to be truthful, and this is the truth

68
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,190
we have seen, that this is what God’s laws 
are, how they work out.

69
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:17,259
Through vibratory awareness we have been able 
to see this is the truth.

70
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,959
” But be completely confident about it.

71
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,360
But for that, first of all you must test yourself 
completely, otherwise you might be playing

72
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,149
into the hands of ego.

73
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:33,399
It happens with many people who start doing 
Sahaja Yoga, to begin with.

74
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:41,920
So be cautious, be sure that you are telling 
the truth and nothing else, and that you have

75
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,800
felt the truth in full ways.

76
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:52,860
Those who have not felt any vibrations, shouldn’t 
talk of Sahaja Yoga at all; they have no authority.

77
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:01,059
They have to receive vibrations, they have 
to fully imbibe within them, and then they

78
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:06,629
can say: “Yes, we felt.

79
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:13,339
” This is a very important task Sahaja Yogis 
have to do in these modern times, is to tell

80
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:20,899
aloud that they have found the truth.

81
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,529
That part is very weak.

82
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,860
In whatever way you like: you can write books, 
you can announce it, you can talk to your

83
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,769
friends, to your relations and everywhere.

84
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:40,790
Tell them that this is the truth now, that 
you have entered into the kingdom of God;

85
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:51,889
that you are blessed by the Grace of God, 
that you are realized souls, that you have

86
00:11:51,889 --> 00:12:04,259
felt the Divine power which is pervading everywhere, 
and that you can give Realizations to others.

87
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:13,660
This you have to tell others, and know that 
by your accepting truth you are not adding

88
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,670
anything to the truth, but you are adorning 
yourself.

89
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:27,869
One requires courage to enjoy the truth.

90
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:39,470
Sometimes people will laugh at you, will mock 
at you, may persecute also; but that should

91
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:50,829
not be any worry to you, because your relationship 
is with the Statutes and with the Grace of

92
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,660
God.

93
00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:02,339
When that is your connection, you should not 
worry about other people, what they have to

94
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,759
say about it.

95
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,629
You have to stand up, adorn yourself with 
that truth and talk to people, that people

96
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:13,079
will know that you have found it.

97
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:22,019
With that authenticity with which you speak, 
people will know that you have found it.

98
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:30,850
The difference between a realized soul and 
a non-realized soul is basically this: he

99
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:38,959
doesn’t talk of his woes and his separation 
with God, but he says: “l have found it

100
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,709
now, this is it.

101
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:49,359
” Like Christ said: “I am the Light, I 
am the Path”.

102
00:13:49,359 --> 00:14:03,449
Or anybody else can say that, but you can 
make out that it is not true.

103
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:14,589
With the confidence, with that complete understanding 
coming out of your heart, people can make

104
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,569
out this is absolute truth.

105
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:21,790
And then all kinds of falsehood must be denounced.

106
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,519
Doesn’t matter if somebody feels bad, because 
by telling that you are saving them, and not

107
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:37,529
harming them; but must be told in a correct 
way, not in a frivolous way.

108
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,910
In a very persuasive way, you must tell them 
that: “No, this is wrong.

109
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,259
” You must wait for the time when you can 
tell people, more in confidence.

110
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,209
Talk to them: “This is wrong, this is wrong, 
you don’t know.

111
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,139
We’ve done the same thing.

112
00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:13,529
” This is how you are going to express your 
principle of mastery, or you can say “Guru

113
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,859
tattwa”.

114
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:20,929
You have to be truthful: first, foremost thing 
is that you should know the truth, you should

115
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:32,049
stand this testimony, and that you should 
announce it.

116
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:38,169
The third thing for a guru in Sahaja Yoga 
has to do, is to develop detachment.

117
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:51,209
Gradually you do develop it, because you find 
that unless and until you develop that detachment,

118
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:56,959
you are not receiving vibrations in full way.

119
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:04,759
All kinds of detachments have to be developed, 
means your priorities change.

120
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:21,470
Once your attention gets fixed up with your 
Spirit, the catch or the hold on things which

121
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:28,769
are of no importance starts reducing by itself.

122
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:35,979
For example, you have a father, you have a 
mother, you have a sister, this is a bigger

123
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,869
problem in India.

124
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:47,029
Here you are over-detached, but in India people 
are very much involved in their own children,

125
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,919
in their own: “This is my son,” and others 
are all orphans.

126
00:16:52,919 --> 00:17:01,709
Only your sons are the real children: your 
daughter, your sons.

127
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:15,190
“My daughter”, “I must do this for my 
son, for my father, mother” – here also.

128
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:27,139
Two types of attachments are there, one through 
mohah, through involvement into them; that

129
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:31,620
you want to do this for them and that for 
them, and give all the property to them, insurance

130
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,889
for them, every sort of thing.

131
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:39,340
And another could be, the way we have here, 
that you hate your mother, you hate your father,

132
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,830
you hate everyone.

133
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,710
Both things are just the same.

134
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,070
So a detachment must be developed.

135
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:04,029
The detachment is that you are your father, 
you are your mother, you are everything, your

136
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,070
Spirit is everything to you.

137
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:19,259
You have to enjoy only your Spirit, as everything.

138
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:25,809
Then the detachment comes from there, and 
then you really do good to them by detaching,

139
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:32,890
because you see the complete vision about 
them and about what is to be done.

140
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,850
For example, people have also attachments 
to certain crazes.

141
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:50,260
Human beings always become crazy after something, 
I mean it can be anything.

142
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:59,730
One has to understand there should be only 
one craze: is to be settled absolutely into

143
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,870
your Spirit.

144
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:08,750
All other crazes will disappear, because that’s 
the greatest joy-giving thing, that’s the

145
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,600
most nourishing thing, that’s the most beautiful 
thing.

146
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,820
So the, all the other things fall off, you 
enjoy only that which is the source of all

147
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,659
enjoyments.

148
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:36,059
So you get yourself attached to your Spirit: 
detachment starts working.

149
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:53,720
Sometimes detachment is taken as a license 
for becoming dry to others, which is absurd.

150
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:01,070
This is only human quality also: make everything 
ugly, whatever is beautiful.

151
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:14,299
Actually, a person who is detached is the 
most beautiful person, is the extremely loving

152
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:18,860
person, he’s love.

153
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,390
Look at the flowers, they are detached.

154
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,240
They are dying, tomorrow they are not going 
to live, but every minute they live, they

155
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,740
are emitting fragrance to you.

156
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:40,370
The trees are not attached to anything, they 
will die tomorrow, doesn’t matter; but anybody

157
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:52,250
who comes to them, they give shadow, they 
give fruits.

158
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:59,340
Attachment means death of love, complete death 
of love is attachment.

159
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:08,590
For example, in a tree, say, the sap rises, 
goes to all the leaves, goes to all the necessary

160
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,750
parts, all the flowers, all the fruits, and 
goes back to the Mother Earth.

161
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,549
He is not attached to anyone.

162
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:20,230
Supposing the sap goes and gets attached into 
one fruit.

163
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,230
What will happen?

164
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,289
The tree will die, and the fruit will die.

165
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:37,179
Detachment gives you the movement of your 
love, circulation of it.

166
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:47,750
For things now, things have no value unless 
and until there are emotions behind it.

167
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:58,009
Now for example, a sari, this one I am wearing 
today, was bought for Guru day, Guru Purnima,

168
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,820
but they had no sari.

169
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:07,599
The other day they wanted to have a sari for 
Puja, so I said: “All right, use this.

170
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,240
” But I wore it again today, just to say 
that this was bought with that emotion that

171
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:22,240
on a Guru day, Mother would like to wear something 
of a lighter shade: white, the pure color

172
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,419
of silk, it’s complete detachment.

173
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,880
But in white all the colors are mixed, then 
only it becomes white.

174
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:43,380
In such a balance and unity it is, should 
be, that you become white, and whiter than

175
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,519
snow.

176
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,220
Detachment is purity, is innocence.

177
00:22:50,220 --> 00:23:02,269
Innocence is such a light, I tell you, light 
that really blinds you to all that is filthy.

178
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,980
You wouldn’t even know that a person has 
come with bad intentions.

179
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,789
You look at the person, you see, say somebody 
comes to you, you’ll say: “Oh, come along,

180
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,460
what do you want?”

181
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,549
You’ll offer him tea and all that, and he’ll 
say: “I have come to rob you.

182
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,889
” “All right, rob me if you want to, it’s 
all right.

183
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:34,070
” He may not at all rob you!

184
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,670
That is what is innocence, which one can develop 
only through detachment.

185
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,669
Detachment is of the attention.

186
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:49,460
Do not allow your attention to get involved 
into something too much, even rituals of anything.

187
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,100
Say, now, we have not washed Mataji’s Feet 
– all right, doesn’t matter.

188
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,870
You love Me, all right?

189
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,879
If some mistakes are committed, what does 
it matter?

190
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:06,679
If you see on the abstract plane, it’s love.

191
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:14,740
This is just a step forward.

192
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:22,879
Like somebody ran very fast and fell down 
before reaching Me, and he said: “Mother,

193
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:30,809
sorry I fell down before reaching You, I should 
have not done that.

194
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:35,820
But see how I prostrated before You!

195
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:49,249
” It’s complete poetry, detachment.

196
00:24:49,249 --> 00:25:01,809
So one has to develop that detachment to be 
a guru, and that detachment doesn’t mean

197
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,070
sanyas or anything like that.

198
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,870
Yes, sometimes one has to wear those dresses 
to announce, because if you have to do lot

199
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:20,890
of work in a short time, then you have to 
take such intensive behavior, like Christ,

200
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,710
we can say, Adi Shankaracharya.

201
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:32,080
All these people had a very, very short life, 
and in that short life they had to achieve

202
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:46,580
such a tremendous task that they had to actually 
take a military uniform, just to avoid problems,

203
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,029
not to impress others.

204
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,170
Now-a-days people wear that dress just to 
impress others that they are detached, and

205
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:57,539
do just the thing opposite of it.

206
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:09,700
So we understand that first, one is not to 
harm anyone, ahinsa, not to kill anyone.

207
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,720
That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t eat 
meat and fish and all that – that’s all

208
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
nonsense.

209
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,220
Of course I mean, you should not hanker after 
food, no doubt about it.

210
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:32,960
“You don’t kill anyone” means you do 
not kill a human being: “Thou shall not

211
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,200
kill”.

212
00:26:34,200 --> 00:27:02,450
So

213
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,039
first thing is not to harm anyone.

214
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,289
Second is to know that you have found the 
truth and give the testimony of the truth.

215
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:26,980
Third is the detachment, the way I have told 
you about detachment: not to get attached

216
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:37,370
to any one person because he’s a relation 
or a something, but develop a universal feeling.

217
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:46,320
And also not to hate anyone: that is even 
worse, that’s a kind of a worse type of

218
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
attachment.

219
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:57,070
This word should go away from the mouth of 
all the Sahaja Yogis: “I hate”.

220
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:03,970
It is called as a dandak, is the Statute.

221
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:12,730
You cannot hate anyone.

222
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,580
Even rakshasas, you better not hate them, 
give them a chance.

223
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:38,360
Now the fourth thing, the fourth Statute of 
the Lord is to lead a moral life.

224
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:54,190
These Statutes were given by all the Gurus, 
take them from Socrates onward, Moses, Abraham,

225
00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:05,480
Dattatreya, Janaka, up to, say, Nanak, Mohammed 
Sahib, and take up to the point where it was

226
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:17,700
only about a hundred years back you can say, 
at the most, was Sai Nath.

227
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,759
All of them have said that you have to lead 
a moral life.

228
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:29,019
None of them have said that you do not get 
married, that you do not talk to your wife,

229
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,471
that you have no relationship with your wife; 
all this is nonsensical.

230
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:31,471
Lead a moral life.

231
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,471
When you are young, not married, keep your 
eyes on the ground; Mother Earth gives you

232
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,471
that innocence by which you develop that principle 
within you, is very important principle.

233
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,471
It’s such a pure principle, it really helps 
the society to develop its dignity.

234
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,471
Now think, in a society where you do not know 
who is your sister, who is your brother, who

235
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:36,471
is your mother, what complications it can 
create; what confusion, what unhappiness.

236
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:38,480
It is one of the most essential things for 
human beings, to be moral.

237
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,220
For animals it is not necessary.

238
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,679
Most of the confusions and problems, specially 
in the Western life, have come because they

239
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,720
have thrown morality in the sea, and to accept 
morality as the very basis of society, it’s

240
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
very difficult for them, it’s a complete 
reversion.

241
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,870
But you have to do it, you have to turn the 
whole wheel back.

242
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:58,780
So, many things were done in the beginning 
of the society to establish this pure relationship.

243
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:05,940
There are laws which act, as if there are 
laws of, chemical laws are there, there are

244
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,100
physical laws are there, in physics and chemistry.

245
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,429
Indeed, there are human laws which one should 
understand.

246
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,950
The relationships between each other, the 
sublimity of their relationship, the purity

247
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:27,529
of their relationship must be understood, 
and then only you can have a very, very happy

248
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:35,169
married life, which is the basis.

249
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:45,440
“Thou shall not commit adultery.

250
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,690
” But Christ has said – perhaps He knew 
the modern people as they would be using their

251
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,269
brains for this – He said: “Thou shalt 
not have adulterous eyes.

252
00:30:54,269 --> 00:31:02,899
” What a vision, in those days to think; 
I mean, even I could not understand it when

253
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,820
I was in India.

254
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:10,010
After only coming here I could see that, what 
did it mean.

255
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,489
It’s a possession on the eyes, possession.

256
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:24,899
It’s a joyless, useless behavior, it’s 
tiring.

257
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:36,799
Attention is frittered away completely; there’s 
no dignity.

258
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,749
Eyes should be steady.

259
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:58,009
When you look at somebody steadily you should 
know that you have got Sahaja Yoga in you;

260
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:02,950
with love, with respect, with dignity.

261
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,659
Not staring at people and just playing into 
the hands of these possessions.

262
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:13,159
The whole society is possessed.

263
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:21,570
All the satanic forces have been let loose, 
I think, and the way people are possessed,

264
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,570
they cannot see through these things.

265
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,870
And they are supposed to be Christians!

266
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:38,159
Attention is to be looked after.

267
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:46,429
That’s the most important thing, because 
attention is the one which is going to be

268
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,259
enlightened.

269
00:32:50,259 --> 00:33:01,280
So we have to know what morality is.

270
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,369
Let people laugh at us, let them say that: 
“These are goodie-goodies,” or this sort

271
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:07,369
of thing.

272
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,369
We are!

273
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:09,369
We are proud of it.

274
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:14,679
We are not ashamed of being righteous people.

275
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,630
This is a very important part of righteousness.

276
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:32,429
Those who do not follow this will lose their 
vibrations very fast.

277
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:43,269
Then, for a guru, he should not accumulate 
things, he should not have possessions, much

278
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:45,179
possessions with him.

279
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:54,429
If he has possessions, they should be just 
for giving away.

280
00:33:54,429 --> 00:34:00,539
A guru must give away his possessions.

281
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:16,200
He should not have stamp-collection, and all 
kinds of collections that people go on.

282
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:27,119
Whatever things are useful, beautiful, which 
give happiness and joy to others, to their

283
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:38,220
eyes: such things must be collected, such 
things which give the symbol to his life.

284
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:50,950
Very symbolic things he should have, which 
suggest that he is a dharmic person.

285
00:34:50,950 --> 00:35:04,030
He should not have things which are symbolic 
of adharmikta, of irreligious life.

286
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:16,790
Everything that he has or he wears, or he 
shows, should be representative of his dharmikta.

287
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:23,849
I don’t know but, I don’t know what was 
the situation here, but in India, when we

288
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:33,370
were young, we were not allowed to listen 
to all kinds of music, not allowed, just not

289
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,370
allowed.

290
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:47,630
Not to see all kinds of filthy things and 
filthy documentaries and things, not allowed.

291
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,329
Anything that is impure, giving bad vibrations 
should not be possessed, and even a, whatever

292
00:35:54,329 --> 00:36:01,170
you have, you should think whom you can give 
this.

293
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:08,950
So it means you should have possessions to 
express your generosity.

294
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:15,630
Sahaja Yogi has to be generous like the sea.

295
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:27,650
A miserly Sahaja Yogi, I cannot think of that, 
it is like mixing of darkness with light.

296
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:34,530
Miserliness is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

297
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:42,710
Anybody whose mind goes: “How much I can 
save money, or save my labor”; how?

298
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,440
There are many labor-saving devices also, 
and money-saving devices.

299
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:57,369
Or cheating others, or making money out of 
certain few things here and there: all such

300
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:03,780
things are against Sahaja Yoga, they will 
pull you down.

301
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,040
Enjoy your generosity!

302
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,480
How many times I must have told you about 
generosity.

303
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:26,730
I remember once I wanted to give a sari that 
I had from abroad, you see, because in India

304
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:34,440
people like that kind of a sari very much; 
though I mean, I don’t understand why they

305
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,510
like it, nylon sort of thing.

306
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:44,280
And a lady said that: “I haven’t got any 
sari from outside and I would like to have

307
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
one imported sari.

308
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,980
” And I had only one left with Me, because 
I am quite good at giving away.

309
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,440
So I told one of my niece-in-laws, I said: 
“I want to give away this sari to her.

310
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,570
On a holy day we can give it to elders, so 
I’ll give it.

311
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,570
”

312
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:07,610
She said: “You have only one left now, why 
do You want to give away?

313
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,890
You have given away all You had.

314
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,890
” I said: “Now, I feel like giving.

315
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,890
I’ll give away.

316
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,890
” And we were discussing this in the kitchen, 
you see, and I said: “Why do you tell Me?

317
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,800
I am not going to take your advice on this 
point.

318
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,309
” And at that time the bell rang and a gentleman 
came.

319
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:26,220
He had brought three saris for Me from Africa, 
and one of them was exactly the same as the

320
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,320
one I had.

321
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,950
Because I had given some silk saris to this 
lady when she was going to Africa, she thought

322
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,270
she should send Me some saris, so she sent.

323
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,720
You are just standing in the center, from 
one door it comes and at the other door it

324
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
goes.

325
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,109
It’s nice to see all that movement, it’s 
very interesting.

326
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:54,570
Apart from that, the way you give it, you 
see, the emotional side of it is so beautiful,

327
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,170
you can’t imagine.

328
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:04,150
I met a lady after, say, twenty years of her 
married life, in London suddenly, and she

329
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,289
said: “Oh, what a coincidence!

330
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:09,170
” I said: “Why?”

331
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:17,970
“You see, I’m wearing the same pearl necklace 
You had given me on my wedding day, today,

332
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,080
and I should meet you!

333
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,240
” I mean, the whole thing, the whole drama 
changed, you know, that meeting.

334
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,410
I mean it was something, nothing so great.

335
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:44,390
It is how you give even a small thing, it’s 
the greatest art of giving, one has to learn

336
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,840
in Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:54,900
Give up the mundane type of things, you see, 
like if you go to somebody’s birthday, you

338
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,270
send a card: “Thank you very much.

339
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,160
” Make it a more deeper, significant thing.

340
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,420
Let us see how you develop your symbols of 
love.

341
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:18,200
And when you’ll have these things of vibrations 
and then you’ll give it to a Sahaja Yogi,

342
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,710
he will know what it is.

343
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:27,520
Never lack in generosity, specially amongst 
Sahaja Yogis.

344
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:35,760
Gradually you’ll be amazed how through small 
things you win over, as if the vibrations

345
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,760
flow through those things and work out on 
those people.

346
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:59,849
Then for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to 
use things which are more natural in their

347
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:08,240
character; to give up artificialities, to 
be more natural.

348
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,970
I don’t say that you go and take out the 
roots and eat them, or you can eat the fish

349
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,970
raw, I don’t mean that.

350
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,470
When going too far with things, always you 
must avoid.

351
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:39,289
But try to lead a life which is more natural; 
natural, in the sense that people know that

352
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:45,940
there is no vanity about you.

353
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:52,970
Or some people can be the other way round, 
you see, they will dress up like a tramp just

354
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,309
to attract more attention.

355
00:41:55,309 --> 00:42:03,710
I mean they can be both ways, you see.

356
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:19,619
When I find some of

357
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:45,630
the people, you see, coloring their hair and 
all that.

358
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,240
So you have to be natural person, very natural 
in your behavior.

359
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:57,079
It can mean anything absurd also to some people 
who do not use their wisdom.

360
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:59,609
Wisdom is very important in Sahaja Yoga, that 
one has to keep intact all the time.

361
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:08,640
“Natural” means you must wear natural 
dresses which are suitable to you.

362
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:21,530
For example, in this climate there is no need 
for you to wear dress like Rama used to wear.

363
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,670
He would not wear anything on top, you see.

364
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,119
There is no need.

365
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:39,490
You have to wear the dress to whatever country 
you belong, whatever suits you for the occasion.

366
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:55,330
Whatever you think is dignified and good, 
which speaks for your more elegance and your

367
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,799
personality.

368
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:08,250
Whatever suits you, you should wear, not like 
all the people wearing that Moss Brothers

369
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:17,990
dress, in the grey suit, horrible-looking, 
and absolutely making clowns out of them.

370
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:30,809
No clownish things are necessary, no dandy 
stuff is necessary: simple, beautiful dresses

371
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:37,950
should be worn, which give you dignity.

372
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:51,329
Actually in the East, people believe that 
God has given you a beautiful body, and it

373
00:44:51,329 --> 00:45:02,730
is to be adorned with the beauty of what human 
beings have created, just to respect it, just

374
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,140
to worship your body.

375
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,960
For example now in India people wear, women 
wear their saris.

376
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,250
The saris are expressive of their moods of 
these women and of expression of their worship

377
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,630
of their body, because you must respect your 
body.

378
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:37,020
Dresses should be such that should be for 
utility as well as dignity.

379
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,289
There is no need to have uniform clothes for 
Sahaja Yoga at all, you see, I do not like

380
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,289
it.

381
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:45,359
There should be variety, as the nature is.

382
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,480
Everyone should look a different person.

383
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:58,450
For a puja and all that you may wear something 
similar, doesn’t matter, where your attention

384
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:03,390
need not be on the variety, but outside, you 
should be a normal person.

385
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:10,309
You are all householders, nobody has to announce 
something.

386
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,010
Even you people, I do not tell you that you 
put on your red mark while walking on the

387
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,799
street, because you should be like normal 
people, not to be pointed out.

388
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:29,530
You need not be absurdly dressed or funnily 
dressed; in a normal way as others wear.

389
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:42,230
To be normal is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:51,171
Then we have to know that Sahaja Yogis have 
to get over all kinds of discrimination and

391
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:56,960
identifications according to races, color 
or different religions into you are born.

392
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:06,210
Because you are born as a Christian, you do 
not belong to a church.

393
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:19,410
You were not born in a church, thank God, 
otherwise all the spirits there would capture

394
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,070
you immediately.

395
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,040
But these identifications will linger on.

396
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:33,450
To accept anything new, you are to be reborn, 
and you are reborn now.

397
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:42,380
Now you are dharmatita – means you need 
not follow any particular type of religion.

398
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:51,940
You are open to all the religions, and all 
the essence of religions you have to take.

399
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:58,079
You are not to denounce any religion any time, 
to insult any religion any time, or to insult

400
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:07,290
any religious Incarnation at any time: it’s 
sin, it is a great sin in Sahaja Yoga; any

401
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:19,940
one of them, and you know who they are.

402
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,210
There should be no racial understanding of 
oneself.

403
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:34,069
You could have been a Chinese or you could 
have been a Negro, you could have been anything.

404
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:46,539
As long as we are all human beings, we should 
know that we laugh the same way, we smile

405
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:50,020
the same way, we hold the same way.

406
00:48:50,020 --> 00:49:01,110
This is all conditioned in our mind of this 
society that you, some are untouchables, some

407
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:10,950
are touchables: this is in our Indian community 
– horrible people.

408
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:19,849
Brahminism of India has ruined India completely, 
and you learn from them.

409
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:30,750
For example, who was Vyasa, the one who wrote 
Gita?

410
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,770
Who was he?

411
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,500
He was illegitimate son of a fisherwoman.

412
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,950
That’s why deliberately he was born like 
that.

413
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:48,470
All these Brahmins who read Gita, tell them 
who was Vyasa?

414
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:54,200
“Brahmins” are those who are realized 
souls, and for realized souls there’s nothing

415
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,480
like all these nonsensical things, like where 
are you born, in what caste and community

416
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,869
you are born.

417
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:18,690
With all education and everything in the West, 
you find this nonsense of racialism; I just

418
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,790
can’t understand.

419
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:27,329
If somebody is fair or dark, after all God 
has to make variety, in color, in every way.

420
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:36,900
Who told you that you are the most handsome 
people going round?

421
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:51,200
Maybe for some of the markets here, or maybe 
in the Hollywood it may fit in; but in the

422
00:50:51,200 --> 00:51:00,870
kingdom of God all these so-called handsome 
people will be denied entry; marrying seven

423
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:08,390
husbands and all sorts of things.

424
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,230
They will be all put in hell.

425
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:19,930
The beauty is of the heart, not of the face, 
and that shows and shines.

426
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,049
I mean, people are a little bit aware of it, 
that’s why they go and tan their faces.

427
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:26,049
I don’t know.

428
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:43,010
They are quite aware that it is too much showing 
off we are doing.

429
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,130
But to have vanity, to have such absurd ideas!

430
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:55,070
Some people like red hair, some like black 
hair, some like this; I mean, there have to

431
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,910
be different types of hair.

432
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,140
And why do you like a particular type of hair?

433
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,720
This I can’t understand.

434
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,660
There’s nothing like “like” and “dislike”, 
whatever God has created is all beautiful.

435
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,539
Who are you to judge whether “I like this” 
and “I like that”?

436
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:13,010
“I”, who is this “I”?

437
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,990
Who likes is Mr.

438
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:22,440
Ego, which is being pampered by this society, 
which teaches you how to smoke cigars and

439
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,010
how to have your lager, morning till evening.

440
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:35,860
All this training and all this conditioning 
has to be thrown away, just like filth, and

441
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:41,990
see that God has created all of you as His 
own children.

442
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,720
It’s such a beautiful thing!

443
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:51,799
Why do you want to make it ugly with these 
ugly ideas?

444
00:52:51,799 --> 00:53:02,840
All this ugliness of “I like” and “I 
dislike” are nonsensical.

445
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,720
Only there should be one word: “I love”.

446
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,599
Forget everything.

447
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:19,089
There’s no need to remember what British 
did to Indians and what Germans did to Jews:

448
00:53:19,089 --> 00:53:20,630
forget it.

449
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:32,960
Those people who did anything are dead and 
finished; we are different people, we are

450
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,809
different people.

451
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,579
We are saints.

452
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:48,680
This is for your Statutes, I have told you, 
which you have to imbibe.

453
00:53:48,680 --> 00:54:04,790
But today I authorize you to be the gurus, 
so that through your own character and through

454
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:16,799
your own personalities, the way you practice 
Sahaja Yoga in your own life and manifest

455
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,930
the light, others will follow you.

456
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:29,190
And that you will establish the Statutes of 
the Lord in their hearts and emancipate them,

457
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:35,780
give them their salvation, because you have 
got your salvation.

458
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,160
You are the channels.

459
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,829
Without the channels, this all-pervading Power 
cannot work out, that’s the system.

460
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:52,460
If you see the sun, its light spreads through 
its rays.

461
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:03,960
From your heart the blood flows through arteries; 
they become smaller and smaller.

462
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:13,799
You are the arteries which is going to flow 
this blood of My Love to all the people.

463
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:19,660
If the arteries are broken, it will not reach 
the people.

464
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,510
That is why you are so important; very, very 
important.

465
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:35,950
The bigger you become, the bigger artery you 
become, then you encompass more people.

466
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:40,519
By that also you are more responsible.

467
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:53,660
Guru must have the dignity, as I have told 
you last time.

468
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,750
“Guru” means the weight, is the gravity.

469
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,549
“Gurutwa” means gravity.

470
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:06,390
You must have the gravity, by your weight.

471
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:22,260
“Weight” means the weight of your character, 
weight of your dignity, the weight of your

472
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:29,592
behavior, the weight of your faiths, and your 
light.

473
00:56:29,592 --> 00:56:49,850
You become the guru not through frivolousness 
and vanity, cheapness, vulgar language, cheap

474
00:56:49,850 --> 00:57:04,730
jokes, anger, temper: all must be avoided 
completely.

475
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:23,670
With the weight of your sweetness, of your 
tongue, the dignity will attract people, just

476
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:33,589
like the flowers when loaded with nectar attract 
the bees from all over; in the same way you’ll

477
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:37,990
be attracting people.

478
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:46,369
But be proud of that; be very, very proud 
of that, and have sympathies for others and

479
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:47,630
care for others.

480
00:57:47,630 --> 00:58:03,430
Now in short I have to tell you how you have 
to do it yourself, this, of the Guru’s working.

481
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:08,390
You have to work out your Void clearly.

482
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:16,309
First of all, you have to know that the Void 
catches when you have a wrong type of a guru

483
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:24,030
– you have had.

484
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:31,780
You must know about your Guru entirely.

485
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:37,800
Try to find out the character of your Guru.

486
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:50,789
Rather difficult, because your Guru is very 
elusive, She’s Mahamaya, not easy to find

487
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:51,789
out.

488
00:58:51,789 --> 00:59:08,289
She behaves in a very normal way, and sometimes 
you are outwitted.

489
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:17,619
But you see how in small things also, how 
She behaves, how Her character is expressed,

490
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:27,170
how Her love is expressed, try to remember 
all that; Her forgiveness.

491
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:38,680
And then you should know that you have the 
Guru which many people must have desired to

492
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:45,069
have, which is the Source of all the Gurus.

493
00:59:45,069 --> 01:00:02,170
It is the ardent desire of even Brahma, Vishnu, 
Mahesha to have a Guru like that, and They

494
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:05,789
must be all jealous of you.

495
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:07,930
But this Guru is very elusive.

496
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:18,190
So to improve your Void, say that: “Mother, 
You are our Guru”.

497
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:25,809
Because of this elusiveness, that fear or 
that awe which is necessary, that respect

498
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:30,450
which is necessary for the Guru is not established.

499
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:41,180
Unless and until you develop that awe, complete 
awe within you, your Guru principle won’t

500
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,180
develop.

501
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,970
No liberty is to be taken.

502
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:54,319
I am telling you Myself, but I am extremely 
elusive.

503
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:01,760
Next moment I’ll make you laugh and forget 
about it, because I’m testing your freedom

504
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,900
to do it, complete freedom.

505
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:14,510
I’ll play with you in such a manner that 
you’ll be forgetting every moment that I’m

506
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:22,289
your Guru, every moment.

507
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:34,200
So first of all you must find out about your 
own Guru.

508
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:41,309
Establish Her in your heart.

509
01:01:41,309 --> 01:02:02,030
I mean you have a wonderful Guru otherwise, 
I must say, I wish I had one like that!

510
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,680
And She is desireless and sinless, absolutely 
sinless.

511
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,920
Whatever I do, it’s not a sin for Me.

512
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,450
I can kill anyone, do whatever intrigue or 
do anything.

513
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:15,039
I really tell you, that’s a fact.

514
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:26,490
Do anything, I am above sin, but I see to 
it that I do not do anything like that in

515
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:34,839
your presence, so that you do not get one 
of these things, because that is My quality.

516
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:49,859
You have a very supreme Guru, no doubt, but 
still you must know that those powers of supremacy

517
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:52,539
you don’t have.

518
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:59,849
I am above all these things.

519
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:04,690
I don’t know what are temptations are, nothing!

520
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,680
I mean, I’ll do whatever I like, it’s 
all My whim.

521
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:17,250
But despite that, I have made Myself very 
normal, and because I must appear before you

522
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:23,160
in such a manner that you understand what 
is the Statutes.

523
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:28,799
For Me there are no Statutes.

524
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,990
I make all the Statutes, isn’t it?

525
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:38,890
Because of you I do all these things and teach 
you every small, small thing, because you

526
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,079
are still children.

527
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:52,160
In the same way, you must remember that when 
you are talking to other people about Sahaja

528
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:59,110
Yoga, remember that they will see you all 
the time, and try to understand how far you

529
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,859
are in it.

530
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:04,359
As I understand you, you try to understand 
them.

531
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:09,269
As I love you, you try to love them.

532
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:25,230
I definitely love you, no doubt, but I am 
Nirmama, I am beyond love: it’s a different

533
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,980
state altogether.

534
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:44,089
Under these circumstances you are better off, 
much better off, because no guru ever goes

535
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:50,990
to that extent.

536
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,740
Apart from that I am the Source of all the 
shaktis, of all the powers.

537
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:00,680
So you can have all the powers from Me, whatever 
you like.

538
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:07,509
I am desireless, but whatever desire you have 
will be fulfilled.

539
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:15,119
Even about Me you have to desire, look at 
that: how much I am bound by you.

540
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:21,950
Unless and until you desire My good health, 
I’ll have bad health; it is to that extent.

541
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:30,710
But to Me, what is bad health and good health?

542
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:37,670
And under these beautiful conditions you should 
really prosper so well.

543
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:40,950
There should be no problem for you to be gurus.

544
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,300
Now, the Void is to be established.

545
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:55,849
First of all you must know your Guru, and 
She is on every Chakra working – imagine!

546
01:05:55,849 --> 01:06:02,960
What a tremendous Guru you have!

547
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,319
With that you’ll feel the confidence.

548
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:15,019
And because it is such a tremendous Guru, 
everybody is getting Realization so easily.

549
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:27,069
If you go to a rich man, for him he’s not 
going to give you two “p’s”.

550
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:35,910
Because She’s so powerful, you are getting 
your powers just like that.

551
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:48,049
So you have to feel very happy about it, extremely 
happy and beautiful that you have got all

552
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:49,049
these powers.

553
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:54,329
At least, those who have been in Sahaja Yoga 
will know this, for some time; those who have

554
01:06:54,329 --> 01:07:02,029
come for the first time may be little bit 
puzzled with My lecture.

555
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:07,569
All of you know, all of you know for definite 
what it is.

556
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:20,000
So to understand your own Guru power, you 
must know Who is your Guru: Sakshat Adi Shakti!

557
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,589
Oh God, it’s too much!

558
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:33,660
Then establish your Void.

559
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:42,130
A guru does not bend his head before anybody 
else, and specially My disciples.

560
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:48,450
Except for mothers and sisters and, you see, 
in some relationship if it is so, so you bow

561
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,869
to that.

562
01:07:52,869 --> 01:08:08,420
But they do not bow to anybody else.

563
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:20,710
And secondly, you must know that your Guru 
has been the Mother of very great people.

564
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:42,170
The thought of them itself should establish 
your Guru tattwa.

565
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:48,090
What tremendous Sons I have had, what great 
Personalities.

566
01:08:48,090 --> 01:09:00,840
No words can describe them, and so many of 
them, one after another.

567
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:07,400
And you are in the same tradition, My disciples.

568
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,960
Keep them as your ideals.

569
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,530
Try to follow them.

570
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:28,330
Read about them, understand them, what they 
have said, how they have achieved such heights.

571
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:33,260
Recognize them, respect them.

572
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,220
You will establish your Guru tattwa.

573
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,400
Imbibe all the Statutes within you, and be 
proud about it.

574
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,170
Don’t be misguided by what people are talking, 
multitudes are talking.

575
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:47,330
We are going to pull the whole multitude towards 
ourselves.

576
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:58,950
First of all let us establish our weight, 
the gravity.

577
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:12,800
As Mother Earth keeps everybody pulling towards 
Earth, we’ll be pulling all of them to ourselves.

578
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:29,960
Today all of you must, within yourself to 
your Spirit, promise that you will be a guru,

579
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,090
worthy of your Mother.

580
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:41,120
May God bless you.

581
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:49,790
(Now for people who have come for the first 
time, they should know that Puja is a thing

582
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,070
not meant for everyone.

583
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,820
Actually we do not get people here really….)
