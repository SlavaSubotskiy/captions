1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,980
You see, in Sahaja Yoga, you are not given 
any mantra or anything.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,660
There’s no, nothing like giving you into 
a big course, like teaching you one after

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,870
another any mantra, or anything, it’s not 
like that.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,210
What you have to know: where the Kundalini 
is, how it is moving, where it is, what is

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,099
the charka catching and what is the mantra 
for that.

6
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:25,300
It doesn’t take anything, hardly it takes 
about a week for you to understand the all

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
thing.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,840
But gradually, as you start using it, you 
become proficient and you how to do it for

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,499
yourself and for others.

10
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:38,840
There is not much of a thing- like a child, 
when he comes up a little age, he starts speaking

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,140
up language, because he has a built-in capacity 
to create sounds.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,390
And he does it.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,610
In the same way, once you get it, when you 
get the cool breeze in you hand, you learn

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,330
it by using it, you understand it yourself, 
you become yourself quite proficient.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,750
And you will be amazed how fast you learn 
this.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,800
You don’t have to learn it just like a science 
book or anything, you just start learning,

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,590
you can: this is charka which is catching 
because now, say, for example, this charka

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,100
is catching [fore finger], right side.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,870
Now, there’s a mantra for this is of Shri 
Krishna.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,740
Say, this charka is catching [forehead], here, 
then there’s a mantra of Jesus Christ.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,200
Like that, you must know the mantras and the 
charkas.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,270
But the charkas you just know as a, absolutely, 
a knowledge which is built-in your nerves:

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,130
you just feel it.

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,880
This is- now this gentleman is saying: ” it’s 
hot here” [left palm].

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Alright, what is that?

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,110
Hot here means what?

27
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,460
That’s the Sahasrara, at the left side.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,110
First it was, the Sahasrara on the right side.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,060
Now, on the left side it’s there.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,450
So that means there’s a mantra for that, 
and that one must be used.

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,049
If you use that mantra, this will be cleared 
out.

32
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,049
Alright?

33
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,560
That is how you have to know.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,970
And that’s why I said it takes time for 
people sometimes to establish, because first

35
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,110
you have to know it and then use it.

36
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,690
Shri Mataji: Come along.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,210
Have you come for the first time?

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,799
Seeker: [Inaudible] 
Shri Mataji: All right, come along.

39
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,590
Come along this side.

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,769
Shri Mataji: So, it is not a difficult thing, 
it is not at all a difficult thing to learn

41
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:18,849
it, it’s very easy.

42
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:23,739
You can pick it up in no time, as soon as 
you start using your hands on other people.

43
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,069
Shri Mataji: Please, be seated.

44
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,069
Alright.

45
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,599
[To a Yogi] Just see them, some people come 
along.

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,409
Now these people, say- who are the latest 
who have come to Sahaja Yoga?

47
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,409
Let’s see.

48
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,930
The latest ones.

49
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,370
Say, those who have come about a month back.

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,639
Seeker: Yes.

51
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,719
Shri Mataji: See, he came back, she came back 
only one month back.

52
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,719
And.

53
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,200
Sahaja Yogini: This is his first time.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,060
Seeker: I was here on Monday.

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,299
Shri Mataji: How much?

56
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,299
Sahaja Yogini: Ah.

57
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,090
Ok, he was here on Monday.

58
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,329
Shri Mataji: Monday, alright.

59
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,329
He’s got it.

60
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,069
But you see, [to someone else] Have you been 
giving vibrations now?

61
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,170
Lady: Yes.

62
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,069
Shri Mataji: In one month, it’s done.

63
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,529
So you can imagine.

64
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,120
And you know about the charkas now?

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Lady: Yes.

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Shri Mataji: About the mantras?

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Lady: Yes.

68
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Not all of them.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,659
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, that’s it.

70
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,879
It’s very simple.

71
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,650
If you pay attention to it, you can do it 
much faster.

72
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,139
There are many people who are here, within 
a month, one month’s time, they pick up

73
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,930
so many things.

74
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,739
Many like that, within one month‘s time.

75
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,970
[To a Sahaja Yogi:] He’s alright.

76
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,939
Because you become the knowledge.

77
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,930
You start feeling it on your fingers, you 
know this is the charka.

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,290
If this finger is, say, burning, [left auricular] 
that means your left heart is catching.

79
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,120
If your left heart is catching, then you know 
because it’s burning!

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,950
Then, there’s nothing to go to the books 
or anything to find out, it’s just burning,

81
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,109
it’s there.

82
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,269
Isn’t it?

83
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,629
That means the left heart is catching.

84
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,719
Now, only you have to know what [Inaudible] 
left heart is catching, the decoding only,

85
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,019
what does that mean.

86
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,920
Your hands will speak Christ has said, alright?

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,079
They will speak, I am just recording it.

88
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,500
Now you see for self if it’s true or not.

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,269
What does that mean?

90
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,130
Left heart means there’s a problem on the 
heart: may be, the person is over hard working,

91
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,100
he has forgotten about his Spirit.

92
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:29,410
The mantra you have to say is: “I am the 
Spirit”, for left heart.

93
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,430
It’s so simple.

94
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,970
Because you have forgotten about your Spirit, 
you are more on the right side in the sense,

95
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,830
you are more extra- you are an extravert and 
more attention is outside, not towards your

96
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,830
Spirit.

97
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,340
Left heart is catching.

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,539
You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well 
when your vibrations are steady.

99
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,460
Now this finger, this is catching [left thumb].

100
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,849
Now this is catching means the person has 
been to somebody who s unauthorized in spiritual

101
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:04,849
life.

102
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:07,259
Anything, say ISP, you call it IST.

103
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,010
Then you have got parapsychology, even psychology.

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,070
Then you have got other things like all these 
gurus, false gurus, you can say this aura

105
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,550
business- what else is there, just now he 
was telling.

106
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,550
Sahaja Yogini: Supernatural, Mother.

107
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,289
Shri Mataji: Supernatural and under-natural, 
and [Big laugh].

108
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:28,800
All these things, you know, all alternatives 
you can think of.

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,949
Anything you can think of, all these things 
and the books, and the Lams and the Dhamas,

110
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,470
and every thing.

111
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,580
[Laugh].

112
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,759
Even people who go, sort of adhere to a chuch 
too much, or adhere to Catholicism again.

113
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,240
Because they are not connected with God and 
they are unauthorized.

114
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,490
[Shri Mataji shows her left palm].

115
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,150
But if you have been to a real guru, then 
immediately I will know.

116
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,300
You won’t have this problem and ascent will 
be very fast if you have been to a real guru.

117
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,659
But how many are real these days?

118
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:02,949
In the market, only those who are marketing 
are they, as I said it: in the market only

119
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,260
the buyers and the shopkeepers.

120
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,330
It’s a market place now!

121
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,180
So the real gurus are not to be seen, there 
are, of course I know, there are many real

122
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,050
gurus also, but wherever they are, they are 
not in the market.

123
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,759
I am the only person fighting them and telling 
them off, you see.

124
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,520
None of them are willing to come down or to 
concede to anything, they said these human

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
beings are hopeless.

126
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
They said: ” twelve years you work Mother, 
then we’ll come down “. They want me alone

127
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,940
to fight the [ordeal?]

128
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,890
[Shri Mataji laughs] doesn’t matter.

129
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,520
So now, it’s a market place, where there 
are buyers and they are simple naïve customers.

130
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:49,660
They just put such absurd things like somebody 
says: “alright, I want to sell a big palace,

131
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,599
with this and that, and all that, only you 
have to deposit 2 thousand pounds.”

132
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,349
Alright, people will be quite willing to do: 
“Oh, what a bargain, let’s pay 2 thousands.”

133
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,599
And the palace may belong to the Queen.

134
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,469
If you go there and ask them: “which palace 
you want to sell?”

135
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,469
“This palace.

136
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,919
” And that belongs to the Queen, you see.

137
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,009
This is unauthorized.

138
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:19,710
Unauthorized people who have nothing to do 
with God, who claim that they have something

139
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,129
to do with God, which is false, and that’s 
why they catch on this finger [left thumb].

140
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,129
And what do they do?

141
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:33,919
They use all these techniques; these techniques 
are called, in Sanskrit language, as “avidya”.

142
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:42,030
” Avidya” means, non-knowledge, you can 
say that it’s not knowledge, something anti-knowledge,

143
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,240
anti-God, this is anti-God.

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,229
So for that the mantra is: “Shuddha vidya”, 
means the pure technique.

145
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,370
It’s the mantra : pure technique, it’s 
the mantra.

146
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,770
“Pure” means the one that comes from the 
Spirit.

147
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,389
Now what they are doing [The Sahaja Yogis] 
is the pure technique because it’s flowing

148
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,389
in them.

149
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,629
If they are moving their hands, there’s 
a power flowing through them and they are

150
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:09,879
working it out.

151
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,249
It’s not just a, acrobatic thing that is 
going on.

152
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:19,860
So the pure knowledge: for example, the way 
they are raising theses candles now in my

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,229
presence, and they themselves are Realized 
souls, it’s working out.

154
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,580
So this is all, it’ the pure “vidya” 
it’s the pure knowledge and the pure technique,

155
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,900
and those who have not done this, have gone 
to such people, they have put their heads

156
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,950
before them, kneeled before them, have done 
something that should not have been done!

157
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,190
So this is it.

158
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,090
And that’s how if you catch on this finger, 
this thumb, left hand, that means a person

159
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,880
has been to somebody like that.

160
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,540
But, with that, if you have any catch on this 
Void [on the palm], or Void here in the stomach

161
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,090
part- this is left Swaddithana, it’s placed 
here down below, which moves like that all

162
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,350
over, and this becomes right Swaddisthana, 
this side.

163
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,340
Now supposing a person catches all round here, 
his Void, and all round here.

164
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,680
Seeker: How do you call it?

165
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,190
Shri Mataji: It’s called as the Void, we 
call it Void.

166
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,580
It’s not the Zen Void.

167
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,430
But the Void is the crossing point which is, 
it’s the viscera, it’s the stomach part,

168
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,870
where-abdomen you can call it, abdomen part 
– and this part, if it is catching that

169
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:33,230
means these are the ten principles of the 
guru.

170
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:43,220
If this is catching, means you have hurt your 
principle of guru, your principle of a master.

171
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,700
That means you have gone to some very wrong 
master.

172
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,130
If this is catching, that means that.

173
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,620
Now, just now as they said, his Void is catching.

174
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,010
The Kundalini will be wobbling there, you 
can see it with your own eyes also.

175
00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,630
You can see the Kundalini just potting [?] – pulsating 
there, you can see the all stomach going into

176
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,480
a trauma.

177
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
And then you have to say the mantra of the 
Primordial master.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,740
Anyone you can do it you see, Guru Nanaka’s 
name you can take, Muhammad’s name you can

179
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,340
take, all of them are Prophets.

180
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,260
Moses’ name, Abraham, all these are there.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,480
So if you take their names, the Kundalini 
can be brought up.

182
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,580
You can strengthen that part, then the Kundalini’s 
pushed up.

183
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,920
So all these so-called Yogas, also like physical 
yoga.

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,770
Now, in the physical Yoga, you will catch 
this finger [right annular], this one [right

185
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,490
major] and this finger [left auricular].

186
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,830
This ring finger here and this finger [left 
auricular].

187
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,660
This is heart, means you have been paying 
too much attention to your physical thing.

188
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,080
Anybody who is working also physically too 
much can also catch this, plus this [right

189
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
annular].

190
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,900
Because when you go into action too much, 
also, as a result of that, the fumes or your

191
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,170
actions create your ego.

192
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,700
And this is one of the biggest problem of 
the West you see, they are not aware that

193
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,970
they have an ego.

194
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,050
But after Realization they start seeing the 
ballon [floating?] like that [Shri Mataji

195
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,440
laughs], they see that and then they come 
and tell me: “Mother I ‘m catching on

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,990
my right Agnya” [right side].

197
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,540
It’s a very delicate stuff.

198
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,270
You can’t tell anybody: “You have got 
ego”.

199
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,070
They [do really?] have it, you see.

200
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,080
So you have to be very careful when you are 
talking to them.

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,570
But actually, so many people felt that there 
is ego in them, so they took to- even people,

202
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,330
when they feel they have too much ego they 
take to alcoholism, because they are frightened

203
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,680
of themselves, they can’t just bear, they 
want to escape that part.

204
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,430
So people are quite conscious.

205
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,900
But after Realization, it becomes a complete 
understanding because you start feeling a

206
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,770
little pain sometimes, in this finger [right 
annular], you feel a pain here and you know

207
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,210
that you have got this Mister ego just coming 
out.

208
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,290
So then you know how to twist it and take 
it out, how to bring it out.

209
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,010
So you start understanding yourself and you 
start understanding others.

210
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,880
I don’t have to tell you, you know yourself.

211
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,420
Now we have certain things, like we use vibrated 
water for clearing your Void.

212
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,850
Now what is vibrated water?

213
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,770
It’s nothing that- but these divine vibrations 
are put into it.

214
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:19,060
And they go and start bombarding that area 
and try to improve it.

215
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,510
We have cured so many people of stomach cancers 
and all those things with it.

216
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,390
Even, we can cure what you call blood cancers 
something with Sahaja Yoga, so many have been

217
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,390
cured.

218
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,200
You can cure, you can do it, no problem, you 
can do it, but, what one has to do [is] to

219
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,030
be steadily moving about with Sahaja Yoga.

220
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,400
Now for example, you have a conception about 
Christ, say for example.

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,590
Now, that conception my not be the real conception 
of Christ, may not be, may be.

222
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,910
So keep your eyes opened.

223
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,890
Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga, you can verify 
it.

224
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,440
But do not deny, first verify.

225
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,830
Supposing you go as a scientist, you have 
to go and see for yourself, isn’t it?

226
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,960
You just deny [?]”no this cannot be true.”

227
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,530
Because whatever you know is your own conception.

228
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,610
Get inside alright.

229
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:17,120
Now when you get inside, keep you eyes opened 
and see for yourself.

230
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,040
And then, once you start seeing it, that’s 
the best way, is knowing, because what you

231
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,950
see is trough your vibrated awareness.

232
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:33,350
For example, now you want to ask a question, 
say, Mother is there God?

233
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,140
Just ask a question thrice and you’ll find 
the vibrations will increase.

234
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,610
It’s a fact.

235
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,550
But if you ask about T.M., you may get even 
burning.

236
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,550
Vibrations will stop.

237
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,940
Better ask about God, so that we have vibrations.
