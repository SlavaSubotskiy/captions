1
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:58,633
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:10,113
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is.

3
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:12,643
We cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:16,793
We cannot organize it.

5
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:21,473
And we cannot use it for our own purposes.

6
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:31,693
Moreover, with the blinkers on both the sides
like a horse, with all our conditionings,

7
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:34,023
we cannot find the truth.

8
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,193
We have to be free people.

9
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:46,593
We have to be open-minded people, like scientists,
to see for ourselves what is the truth.

10
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:56,423
If somebody preaches something, professes
something, says something, is not to be accepted

11
00:11:56,423 --> 00:12:00,113
blindfolded.

12
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:07,133
As I told you yesterday, that the essence
of all the religions is to find the eternal

13
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:16,803
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding
and in its own limitations.

14
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,783
That’s why we have lost our balance.

15
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:35,413
If we are really the people who want to know
the truth, we have to know that at human awareness

16
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,553
we cannot know it.

17
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:42,662
It becomes a concept.

18
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:51,243
You have to have the spiritual awareness,
but spiritual awareness is a state of your

19
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:56,063
being, where you become the spirit.

20
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,313
Again the word I’ll say – “become.”

21
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:05,983
It’s not artificially certifying somebody
that now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

22
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:09,143
or a Muslim, you become anything.

23
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:16,643
Because you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu,
anything, you can commit any sin.

24
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,903
You can do anything that is wrong.

25
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:25,263
Nothing from inside is going to stop you.

26
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:32,673
So all these things have become so much outward
that now there are people who have started

27
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:40,513
saying there is no God, there is nothing like
religion, which is not true.

28
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:48,703
First of all when we say there is nothing,
or there is not God, we should find out, have

29
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:57,943
we been able to find out about it or just
in our ego we are saying there is no God?

30
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:03,793
Have we been able to work it out to see if
there is God or not?

31
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:08,553
You do not judge God by the people who talk
about God.

32
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:14,523
Anybody can talk about God because they think
there’s no law that can catch them.

33
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:19,413
They can talk against Him, they can talk for
Him, they can do the way they like.

34
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:24,573
They can even make money by talking against
God and against all the prophets – that’s

35
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:30,303
a very good way of making money, blackmail.

36
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:38,013
But does that mean that whatever is written
is a bible, or whatever is black and white,

37
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:43,163
is to be taken that seriously?

38
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:52,453
So first of all, we have to be little independent
to be free, to know that if you have to know

39
00:14:52,453 --> 00:15:00,553
the spirit - as they said “know thyself”
- then you have to know it on your central

40
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,273
nervous system.

41
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:17,763
As I can feel this is cold or hot, you have
to feel the divine power which is all-pervading,

42
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:27,923
which is the truth, which manifests the truth,
because it is the love of God.

43
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:38,383
You have to first feel it on your central
nervous system, which is the bodha.

44
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:46,323
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced
so much, all right.

45
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:50,893
We have gone too far with everything.

46
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:58,113
But if we see, when we started with science,
what have we produced?

47
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:04,703
Hydrogen bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils
sitting on our heads.

48
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:12,573
You take to any enterprise that we did, we
go to extremes.

49
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,303
There is no balance.

50
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:21,692
Any mental projection is linear, it moves
in one line and then recoils back, and then

51
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,192
you are shocked.

52
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,953
Now you have got acid rain.

53
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:28,323
You produced machinery, all right.

54
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:33,373
Machinery is for you, you are not for machinery.

55
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:42,243
And thus, there is no balance between you
and the machinery, no balance between you

56
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:43,243
and the science.

57
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:50,433
It is just like going amok with anything that
you get into your hand.

58
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:58,303
And this balance you can only have when you
become the spirit.

59
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:05,183
You see beautiful chandeliers here, beautifully
made, but unless and until there is light

60
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:09,813
what is the meaning of these chandeliers?

61
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,643
Nothing.

62
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:19,323
In the same way, if you do not have the light
of the spirit shining in your attention, you

63
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,863
will not know your meaning.

64
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:26,533
Like this instrument – unless and until
it is connected to the mains, it is useless.

65
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:34,153
Unless and until we are connected to the mains,
we do not know the absolute, and that’s

66
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,363
why all these problems are there.

67
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:50,933
Now when I am talking about this instrument,
which lies within us, one has to again know

68
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:56,843
that this is the knowledge of the roots.

69
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:00,743
And to know the knowledge of the roots, you
have to become a subtler personality.

70
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:05,923
With a gross mind, you cannot see it.

71
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:12,933
To become the subtler personality, minimum
of minimum, you have to know that so far you

72
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,733
have not known the roots.

73
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,933
If you had known, there would be no problem.

74
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:30,813
But there’s something has gone wrong somewhere
in every human enterprise, even in religions,

75
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:41,063
that’s why today we find this kind of a
farce going on.

76
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:48,603
And what is gone wrong is that we have to
seek the eternal.

77
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:56,563
Maybe it might look a little different, for
example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

78
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,943
God at all.

79
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:07,783
I also did not talk about God for four years,
at least three years.

80
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:14,632
As soon as you talk of God, again people start
jumping, “When can we become God?” – this

81
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:18,353
is the first question.

82
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:21,813
So first you become the self –the first
step.

83
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,702
That’s why they did not talk.

84
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:28,423
They said first you become yourself.

85
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:36,303
Unless and until you have your eyes, how can
you see the colors?

86
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,553
So first have your eyes.

87
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:51,383
It is for your benevolence that you better
get what you deserve, what is your own.

88
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:57,463
It’s your birthright as a human being to
become the spirit.

89
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,923
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha means
“with” and ja is “born.”

90
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:12,113
Born with you is the right to get this yoga,
is the union with the Divine.

91
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:16,813
It’s your birthright as a human being.

92
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:21,943
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

93
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:31,653
And it has to work out, but please open your
hearts and open your minds.

94
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,253
Just open it and see for yourself, it will
work, I know.

95
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,713
Yesterday it has worked.

96
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,423
It is going to work out today also.

97
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:45,173
But by thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.

98
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:56,313
This is the biggest problem of our seeking
that we run after some sort of a concept.

99
00:20:56,313 --> 00:21:03,473
Now here you have seen this instrument is
the most beautiful instrument that is created

100
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:08,813
within us during the process of our evolution.

101
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:16,783
The first one is the most beautiful one because
it stands for our innocence.

102
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:25,053
This innocence is the one which gives us real
support, real strength.

103
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:30,613
And you’ll be surprised it is never destroyed.

104
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:37,973
It may be overshadowed, there may be clouds.

105
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:42,073
Maybe it may look to be a very dark sky.

106
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,343
Maybe a hopeless case.

107
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:48,192
Some people might say that we have destroyed
our innocence.

108
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:52,373
It cannot be destroyed.

109
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:58,223
Whatever you might have done, this is one
center which cannot be destroyed.

110
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:02,323
You may have problems with it but it cannot
be destroyed.

111
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:08,773
It is such a wonderful center you have got,
which has got four petals, which looks after

112
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:16,103
the pelvic plexus, looks after all the excretion
within us.

113
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:26,053
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds
of things which may not be benevolent for

114
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,512
ourselves, doesn’t matter.

115
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:45,012
Kundalini cannot be destroyed - the source
which is going to give you the self-realization,

116
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:48,803
I say She is your individual Mother.

117
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:55,763
And this Mother is such a loving Mother and
She knows each and everything about you - from

118
00:22:55,763 --> 00:23:01,303
your past, from your past lives - She knows
you very well.

119
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:09,473
She is just waiting for a chance that She
can be awakened and She can give you your

120
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:10,783
second birth.

121
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:16,463
When you were born, your mother suffered for
you – you did not suffer.

122
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:22,023
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this
kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

123
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,213
is all falsehood.

124
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,473
Absolutely falsehood.

125
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:33,843
And it is so absurd that how can a mother
give you problems?

126
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:40,723
I mean, I don’t know about some mothers
are funny also – that’s all human problems.

127
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,713
But this is a Divine Mother.

128
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,533
She’s not going to give you trouble.

129
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:55,593
But these problems that have come are coming
from people who have no authority, who have

130
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:59,593
no education, who do not know what Kundalini
is.

131
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:05,593
Some say it is in the stomach, some say in
the head, some say in the legs.

132
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:12,273
Those who have no character of their own,
because they have to be pure people themselves,

133
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:18,632
try all kinds of nonsensical tricks and create
problems on the sympathetic nervous system

134
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:26,483
and they call it as something that it is the
problem of the Kundalini.

135
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:30,423
Kundalini will never give you any problems.

136
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:36,463
On the contrary, when She rises and when you
get your awakening, the first thing that is

137
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:39,463
established is thoughtless awareness.

138
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:51,002
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought
rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

139
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:56,312
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.

140
00:24:56,312 --> 00:25:05,353
It makes you stop in the present and you grow
in the present, and the thoughts, if you want

141
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:09,952
to think you can think, if you don’t want
to think, it is not like a madhouse going

142
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:16,262
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop
it.

143
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:24,383
This works out with the Kundalini’s awakening
when She crosses this center of ours, which

144
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,312
we call as Agnya chakra.

145
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:29,933
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers
about Christ.

146
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:36,523
Let us see what people have to say about Christ
in other shastras and scriptures.

147
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:41,323
Who was He?

148
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:47,433
Because people did not allow Him to manifest
for more than four years and in four years

149
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,742
what can you do?

150
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:52,192
You cannot do anything.

151
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:58,873
I must tell you in London I came, My husband
was selected for a job and that’s how we

152
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:05,993
are here, and for four years I was struggling
with seven of them, just struggling.

153
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:11,153
Giving realization was such a difficult subject
to the English people at that time.

154
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,333
They are hard nuts, I know.

155
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,883
But once they break, they are the best.

156
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,843
I think the best are the hardest.

157
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:25,843
And it worked, it clicked.

158
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:34,692
I am surprised that I had to work very hard
but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

159
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:39,663
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly
also – a lot of scholarship in them.

160
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:46,472
Found out all about Kundalini, everything
from wherever – your libraries are so well-equipped.

161
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,653
And I was surprised, it was all there.

162
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,273
They studied Sanskrit.

163
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:59,583
Now can you imagine these people English singing
Sanskrit song with that speed?

164
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:04,273
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi
when they were in India.

165
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:10,043
Three hundred years they were there, they
could not speak one sentence you will be surprised.

166
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:14,673
We had to tell them in English how to speak
Hindi.

167
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:21,543
Like you have to say “open the door” – is
in Hindi, is darwaja khol do.

168
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:22,543
They couldn’t say it.

169
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:27,533
So we had to say, “there was a banker”
or something like that – means “close

170
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,962
the door” – “there was a banker.”

171
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:32,513
They couldn’t speak Hindi.

172
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,623
Sanskrit is very far off.

173
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,712
And now look at them, what has happened to
them.

174
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:44,313
And Indian music is such a difficult music,
you have to really, it is a question of penance,

175
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:45,393
tremendous penance.

176
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:51,263
Now we have people who play beautiful tabla,
beautiful instruments not only but sing so

177
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,263
well.

178
00:27:52,263 --> 00:28:00,463
Swiss, the hardest nuts you can ever think
of, they are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss

179
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:09,443
the way they sing, tremendous manifestation
in such a short time.

180
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:15,393
Of course they can also sing English very
well, they know English music very well, or

181
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,613
should say Western music very well.

182
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,942
But to learn this difficult melodies of India
is remarkable.

183
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:25,993
I am myself surprised at this.

184
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:34,003
So what happens in the second center when
it enters, you just become dynamic, because

185
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,833
the second center is for aesthetics and for
creativity.

186
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:48,783
Now we have, like My brother who was a chartered
accountant, he was very bad at all the languages.

187
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,523
Very bad, of course Sanskrit was out of question.

188
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:58,363
Now he is making poetry in Sanskrit and in
Urdu language and also in Marathi, which is

189
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,363
the most difficult language.

190
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:02,413
This is the second center.

191
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:09,583
When Kundalini nourishes that center, like
a very beautiful Mother she nourishes.

192
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:17,662
You must have heard about some great artists
– Amjad Ali, he was here – after realization

193
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:19,143
he became such a great artist.

194
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:21,523
There are so many artists.

195
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:23,432
In India, they understand.

196
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,013
They want to sing before Me.

197
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,953
I mean I don’t know how to say that now
only one person can sing.

198
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:37,603
Because their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity
becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

199
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:46,253
At the same time, that person becomes very
mild, very sweet, very compassionate.

200
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:49,863
Like there’s one great singer.

201
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:53,393
She’s a Muslim lady, I will not name her.

202
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:57,043
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please
allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

203
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:59,162
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

204
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,222
So she came down.

205
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:08,113
And the lady who was playing harmonium – she
came and told Me, “This lady is just an

206
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:15,553
atom bomb, You don’t know how she gets angry
if there’s one note I play wrong.”

207
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:21,412
I saw her but she was very silently playing
– nothing doing, she never got angry with

208
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:22,412
anyone.

209
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:26,603
So in the interval, this lady comes and tells
Me, “That see in Your presence, I don’t

210
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:29,553
know what has happened to this lady.

211
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:33,462
This tiger has become like a cow.

212
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,913
How is it?”

213
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:38,323
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

214
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:47,662
So this violence, this anger, this temper
is not your creation, it’s the creation

215
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:48,863
of your liver.

216
00:30:48,863 --> 00:31:00,303
Your liver is little out of order because
of many things, and the temper is there.

217
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:03,863
Now when the temper is too much, you don’t
know what to do.

218
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,333
I mean you can do whatever you like.

219
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:10,692
In your temper after all, it’s like a drunken
personality.

220
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:15,743
You have to approach a person in a temper
with a barge pole.

221
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:20,553
But all this temper, everything, becomes so
cool and so beautiful.

222
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:23,583
It’s very surprising.

223
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:32,273
A very dynamic person becomes extremely compassionate,
extremely compassionate, and I’ve had such

224
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:41,803
beautiful experiences of their compassion
that it’s not easy to describe.

225
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:49,343
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities
which has got a trait like this and a trait

226
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:53,503
like that, everything dissolves.

227
00:31:53,503 --> 00:32:02,603
Everything dissolves because of this center
which is so creative and which also gives

228
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:09,553
you the manifestation of pure knowledge - pure
knowledge.

229
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:16,472
For example you start feeling on your finger
tips – you just start feeling on your finger

230
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,472
tips.

231
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:24,363
Like today only, somebody came and told Me,
“That Mataji my Agnya is catching.”

232
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:30,523
Agnya is this center - means “I’ve got
my ego on.”

233
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,662
Will anybody say like that?

234
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:36,403
On the contrary if you tell somebody, “You
have got your ego,” they’ll show you that

235
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,202
they have their ego on.

236
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:42,293
It’s very dangerous to say to somebody that
your ego is on.

237
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:48,633
But just because of self knowledge - pure
knowledge - you know that this Mr. Ego is

238
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:59,153
sitting here and I cannot cross through and
there’s a blockage here, which I have to

239
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:00,303
take it out.

240
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:04,563
It’s so innate within you, everything, only
thing is your connection has to be made.

241
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:08,773
Once the connection is made, immediately you
know about yourself.

242
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:20,743
And this center which is responsible for creating
all kinds of funny thoughts and horrible creativity

243
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:26,633
becomes so benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

244
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:34,773
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these
people who could not even say one word in

245
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:41,663
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit
and this - specially the one they sang, the

246
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:49,073
first one - many Indians cannot sing that
way I can tell you, they can’t.

247
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,753
It’s not easy.

248
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:55,113
It’s a very great tongue twister first of
all the language is.

249
00:33:55,113 --> 00:34:02,623
Apart from that, to sing in such a correct
pronunciation is so difficult but they have

250
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:07,023
done it.

251
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:14,103
So in Sahaja Yoga, an artist who is struggling
today may become a great artist tomorrow.

252
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:18,413
But still I would say these are temptations.

253
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:23,243
You’ll become a great artist, you’ll start
earning more money, this, that…but that’s

254
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:24,643
not the one.

255
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:30,513
You have to really be satisfied with, you
will never be satisfied with that.

256
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:37,813
So you move to the third center which we call
as the Nabhi chakra.

257
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:47,063
This center is, on one side, is made of water
and another side with fire.

258
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:59,192
Around it are our ten valencies, which we
can call as our innate religion within ourselves.

259
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:11,533
Now this Nabhi itself - or we can call the
solar plexus or we can say the Navel chakra

260
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:20,773
- gives us, as soon as the Kundalini rises,
she awakens this and the light when it spreads,

261
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:22,142
you become religious.

262
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:27,443
I don’t have to tell you anything, you just
become.

263
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:29,853
I don’t have to say that you don’t take
drugs.

264
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:31,403
You just don’t take it.

265
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:34,543
Overnight I have seen people have given up
drugs.

266
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:35,643
Overnight, alcoholism.

267
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:36,732
Overnight, everything.

268
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:39,482
And they enjoy their virtues.

269
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,533
That’s the best part of it.

270
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:44,682
Some people think, well then what is the fun?

271
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:53,623
What is this that you take something in the
pub and next day you have hangover.

272
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:58,702
Here you take something and next day you are
much better off.

273
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:01,613
It never comes down.

274
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,413
It never gives you a reaction.

275
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,413
It’s not artificial.

276
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,103
It’s not intoxicating.

277
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:11,873
It is from your nerves it’s bubbling out.

278
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:18,673
So this is the center which is very important
in us because most of us have a problem with

279
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,863
this center.

280
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:40,833
And here we have a capacity by this center
that we enjoy our generosity.

281
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:47,682
Now all matter whatever it is - we are materialistic,
materialistic, it is a good idea to be materialistic.

282
00:36:47,682 --> 00:36:56,253
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters
are, that you can give it to others suggesting

283
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:58,453
your love in it.

284
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:01,603
I think that’s the only thing the matter
can do.

285
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:08,133
And in a very special way you can express
that love.

286
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:16,783
For example, somebody likes a particular thing
- you go all the way to get it and give that

287
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:28,462
small thing, very small thing, to the person
and the joy, not out of the money that you

288
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:38,192
have spent, but the feelings you have expressed
of knowing what that person would love.

289
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:46,432
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

290
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:53,973
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.

291
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:59,793
And you don’t need anything because everybody
is looking after your needs.

292
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:05,483
Now I have told them I love flowers because
I don’t take anything else.

293
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,963
So you must see whenever I come My house is
so filled with flowers that My husband was

294
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:13,543
saying, “Let us go live in the garden and
let the flowers be here.”

295
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:23,933
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this
center.

296
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:34,553
And whatever you eat, whatever you have to
eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

297
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:39,982
You don’t have to bother as to what to eat,
what not to eat – you just eat whatever

298
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:42,253
is good for you, benevolent for you.

299
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:47,863
You become so wise and also you please others.

300
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:52,513
You don’t displease others by saying, “This
is bad food, I want that.”

301
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:54,573
’I want’ goes away.

302
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:57,053
What do you want?

303
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:59,773
[speaks aside]

304
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:09,712
So the, like you could say a candle which
is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

305
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:14,043
is asking for the light – “I want light.”

306
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:21,333
But once it is enlightened, it gives light
to others, automatically - supposed to be.

307
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:30,173
In the same way you also start giving your
light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.

308
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:32,803
I don’t have to tell you.

309
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,922
Nobody has to go through any Ten Commandments
anymore.

310
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:38,913
Those days are gone.

311
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:54,353
Now automatically you become like that - very
beautiful people, very affectionate and glorious,

312
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,353
I should say.

313
00:39:55,353 --> 00:40:02,932
If you see the glow on the face of Sahaja
Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

314
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:13,123
Many people drop out their ten years to twenty
years in their age and they are so enthusiastic,

315
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:20,862
never get tired, especially in England I’ve
seen – or also in the West I would say everywhere

316
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:22,743
– people get very really tired.

317
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:26,253
On the television also you find people will
come and sit down “huh…”

318
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:34,103
Young people, they’ll talk ten times, they’ll
say “huh…

319
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:38,473
Why are we so tired?”

320
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:40,722
Because we think too much.

321
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:47,353
All energy is wasted in thinking, so no energy
left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

322
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:54,823
For example, you have to have people for dinner,
they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

323
00:40:54,823 --> 00:41:00,363
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated
and so nervous about the whole thing – when

324
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:04,703
the guests come in, they feel like running
away.

325
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:08,692
Because so much of tension of thinking, thinking,
thinking…..

326
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:12,523
Planning, planning, planning, planning, planning…

327
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:16,652
Ultimately the whole joy has disappeared.

328
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:27,533
So the second center which is there, it does
a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

329
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:34,183
grey cells in our brain, when we are using
it for thinking, and also it looks after your

330
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:45,333
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys
and lower part of your abdomen.

331
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:51,633
Instead of doing that, poor thing is busy
only sending grey cells to your brain because

332
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,433
thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, like
mad.

333
00:41:55,433 --> 00:42:01,533
So you develop all other diseases – liver
trouble, which is very common.

334
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:05,813
Then you develop diabetes – very common.

335
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:13,783
Yesterday at least there were ten people who
said we have diabetes.

336
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:18,442
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking
too much sugar – take it from Me.

337
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:25,513
In India if you go to a village, you’ll
see that he takes sugar in such a manner that

338
00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:30,962
in the cup the spoon must stand at right angles,
otherwise he won’t take it.

339
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,583
But he never gets diabetes.

340
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:40,453
The reason is he doesn’t think of tomorrow
- he just works hard, eats his food and sleeps

341
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:41,593
off, nicely.

342
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:44,993
He doesn’t take sleeping pills either.

343
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:52,962
So this diabetes comes by over-thinking and
can be easily cured if you can take to Sahaja

344
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:59,672
Yoga, which I’ll tell you how we’ll stop
our thinking at this, I’ve already told

345
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:02,192
you, at this point.

346
00:43:02,192 --> 00:43:07,263
Then the third disease which is even more
dangerous than this, is the disease which

347
00:43:07,263 --> 00:43:11,693
we call as blood cancer.

348
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:15,152
Blood cancer is caused only to people who
think too much.

349
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:21,593
It can even be to the children if the mother
is very meticulous, particular about her carpets

350
00:43:21,593 --> 00:43:25,952
or her house, everything you know and even
a rat doesn’t enter that house.

351
00:43:25,952 --> 00:43:31,293
But she is very careful that all her things
are properly done, her sink doesn’t have

352
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:36,613
even so much of, little bit of a spot left
in it.

353
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:42,973
All the time, thinking, planning, thinking,
planning.

354
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:47,244
This affects the child and a child also can
get blood cancer.

355
00:43:47,244 --> 00:43:56,593
Blood cancer you get it because your spleen
is a speedometer- is the one which gives you

356
00:43:56,593 --> 00:44:00,093
the rhythm of life, rhythm of life.

357
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:11,043
Now when we are hectic people, all the time
under shock, then this goes out of order.

358
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:21,753
For example in the morning we get up and see
the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

359
00:44:21,753 --> 00:44:26,163
have killed someone – such a shock.

360
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,553
Then an accident, then…

361
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:30,863
I mean newspaper will never give good news,
will they?

362
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:38,713
Will they give news, how many people got realization
or something is working out all, all right?

363
00:44:38,713 --> 00:44:44,933
No something horrible that should shock your
heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise

364
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:48,843
you’ll not take it seriously.

365
00:44:48,843 --> 00:44:55,673
So, once you read that, you don’t know your
system is a very delicate system, it gets

366
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:56,913
a shock.

367
00:44:56,913 --> 00:45:01,023
And then you get into your car, without taking
your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

368
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:03,143
breakfast because you are late.

369
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:08,323
On the way there is a jam – you are shouting,
screaming - somehow or other you reach the

370
00:45:08,323 --> 00:45:14,653
office and there is the boss barking.

371
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:18,063
This is how we live, under complete tension.

372
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:21,943
We are supposed to be free people.

373
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:29,443
In the night if you sing loudly the neighbor
will come and put you to the police station.

374
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:32,563
I mean you can’t do anything.

375
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,443
There’s no freedom.

376
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,173
You have to be bound by the watch.

377
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:41,763
This is the time, exact you have to reach
there.

378
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:48,543
So all these things, pressures, and all these
things work on us and we become hectic.

379
00:45:48,543 --> 00:45:59,473
And for emergency, this spleen is the one
which releases red blood corpuscles – RBCs.

380
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:04,973
But if you are all the time like this hectic,
that poor spleen becomes mad.

381
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:08,893
It doesn’t know what to do.

382
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:15,523
It starts producing more cells, more cells
and then it thinks it’s a mad person I am

383
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:19,633
fixed with because I don’t know when to
act, when not to act.

384
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:24,303
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly
with some other shock, you might get blood

385
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:29,983
cancer and then the doctors will certify you
are going to die after one month.

386
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:33,333
Finished, prepare for your burial.

387
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:37,343
And the whole house is crying.

388
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:51,623
But we have cured, I mean Sahaja Yoga has
cured blood cancer of many people just by

389
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:59,043
this Kundalini awakening because as soon as
the Kundalini is awakened, too much movement

390
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:04,233
this side and that side, this all the time
going on, in the center – this is the left

391
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:09,093
and the right side of the sympathetic – so
just the Kundalini passes through, strings

392
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:16,773
through and brings it back and nourishes it.

393
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:18,853
The problem is over.

394
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:26,153
And though they were certified to be dead,
after even four years they are all right,

395
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:35,033
working all right, the certificate is cancelled.

396
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:43,393
Even vulnerability to cancer, or to all incurable
diseases, are because of these centers going

397
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:49,603
out of place.

398
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:56,923
Now we have the center which we call here
as the heart center.

399
00:47:56,923 --> 00:48:03,903
It controls the left and right, both – so
we have a left and right heart in Sahaja Yoga.

400
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:16,313
As you know that, this sternum bone creates
the antibodies for you.

401
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:21,793
And these antibodies fight your diseases.

402
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:32,404
So when this center goes out, this is the
center which sends all the messages to these

403
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:35,933
antibodies.

404
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:40,703
Now this is the center of a mother.

405
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:47,352
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop
breast cancer.

406
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:55,923
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is
worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

407
00:48:55,923 --> 00:49:07,393
her motherhood is challenged and her sense
of security is very disturbed.

408
00:49:07,393 --> 00:49:15,243
As a result of that, she gets this problem.

409
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:22,453
Also if you are too much of a thinker, and
you think too much and you’re very, what

410
00:49:22,453 --> 00:49:28,613
we call the right-sided, the futuristic planner,
I mean people plan it for ten years.

411
00:49:28,613 --> 00:49:34,143
They plan even their deaths, what dress they
are going to wear and where they are going

412
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:39,373
to be buried, up to that point.

413
00:49:39,373 --> 00:49:48,493
All this futuristic planning creates such
tremendous heat in the body because the liver,

414
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:54,833
which is supposed to absorb all the heat,
is neglected by this center.

415
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:00,243
As a result that heat travels up and you develop
asthma.

416
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:07,203
Now we had yesterday, at least five or six
people who came with asthma.

417
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:10,873
Asthma is absolutely curable.

418
00:50:10,873 --> 00:50:15,093
But do you know this is the center of a husband,
or of the father.

419
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:20,033
Now if I am telling you, you should not be
shocked, because later on you’ll find it.

420
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:24,563
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get
asthma.

421
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:29,863
Or if your wife is a shrew, you might get
an asthma.

422
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:35,463
Or if you are a very bad father, you might
get an asthma.

423
00:50:35,463 --> 00:50:41,663
Or if your father is not kind to you, you
might get an asthma.

424
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:46,983
If you have not forgiven your father, you
might get asthma.

425
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:53,703
Now can you believe it, just forgiving your
father, you can get out of your asthma permanently.

426
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:57,173
Sahaja Yoga has cured asthma of so many people.

427
00:50:57,173 --> 00:51:01,773
Believe it or not, it works.

428
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:11,093
It looks so funny but our relationships, our
parents we have chosen when we came on this

429
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:12,093
Earth.

430
00:51:12,093 --> 00:51:18,483
I know they are wrong, they are obstinate,
they’re headstrong, they may be drunkards,

431
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:19,953
whatever they are.

432
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:24,953
But even if you leave them, because so many
people leave the parents, still forgive them

433
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:25,953
and forget.

434
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:28,333
Otherwise you carry the problems with you.

435
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:36,803
The left heart is the place of the mother.

436
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:41,523
Now if your mother has been hard with you,
if you have had very bad experiences, you

437
00:51:41,523 --> 00:51:46,353
will have problems of the left heart.

438
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,663
Center heart is very important where your
sense of security should be established.

439
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:55,953
You’ll be surprised in the disease called
AIDS, it is the center heart which is out.

440
00:51:55,953 --> 00:52:03,423
We have tried to cure, and we cured also 3,
4 people from AIDS, but they have no will-power

441
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:06,773
to continue with Sahaja Yoga, they want to
die.

442
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:12,623
And they have made a big martyrdom out of
it, you see they are martyrs, great martyrs

443
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:15,413
of a great principle they have established.

444
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:21,753
It’s impossible to convince to them, that
this is unnatural that you are doing and that

445
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:24,643
you should give it up and you should live,
why should you die?

446
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:30,093
No, we are martyrs for such a big principle
we have established.

447
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:35,823
To do something out of the way and new is
the modern fashion.

448
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:43,173
Anything - will do something with the hair,
with the nose, with the eyes, with the ears,

449
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,483
with the clothes.

450
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:46,672
That’s all you can do.

451
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:55,903
To such an extent that they do not realize
that whatever is new may not be good for you.

452
00:52:55,903 --> 00:52:58,043
For example, everyday we eat our dinner.

453
00:52:58,043 --> 00:53:04,873
Supposing we want to eat the table because
it is new – is it a sensible thing?

454
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:08,383
Anything that is new, is not good.

455
00:53:08,383 --> 00:53:11,463
But anything that is old, may not be good
also.

456
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:17,153
So you have to have that wisdom which comes
to you through Sahaja Yoga.

457
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:23,503
There is no other way out - you have to become
the spirit, and you have to see in the light

458
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:26,483
of the spirit, what is right and what is wrong.

459
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:34,963
So then wecome to this center which is, we
call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

460
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:37,103
petals, looks after the cervical plexus.

461
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:42,903
Now this is a very very important center and
this is the center is for communication.

462
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:47,753
For example, when you talk, you communicate
through your hands.

463
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:51,803
You shake hands, you touch somebody, and you
can communicate.

464
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:55,653
Even if you cannot talk, with your hands you
can communicate.

465
00:53:55,653 --> 00:54:05,693
Also when we think we are very responsible,
this center goes out.

466
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:12,093
Like some people were traveling by plane - they
were from villages, they did not know what

467
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:13,363
was a plane.

468
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:20,623
They were told to take less luggage because
it should not be a weight for the plane.

469
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:23,433
So they got into the plane and put all of
the luggage on their heads.

470
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:30,303
And they said that “We are trying to reduce
the weight of the plane.”

471
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:37,933
In the same way, we are also... actually the
One - which is all-pervading power, which

472
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:42,263
has created us, created this universe and
has brought us to this level of human beings

473
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:43,703
- is doing everything.

474
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:48,863
But we think we are responsible, we have to
do it.

475
00:54:48,863 --> 00:54:53,383
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you just
do it, no doubt.

476
00:54:53,383 --> 00:54:56,683
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

477
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:58,513
You just say its happening.

478
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:01,553
And what a beautiful feeling it is.

479
00:55:01,553 --> 00:55:08,083
Then you don’t have blood pressures, you
don’t have headaches, you don’t have tensions

480
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:10,813
– no, because we are not doing it.

481
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:18,143
It is just done and you find it’s all done.

482
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:26,353
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve
told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

483
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:27,483
you can control.

484
00:55:27,483 --> 00:55:31,123
If you want you can think or you don’t think.

485
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:34,703
But in that silence you feel your peace.

486
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:43,263
If there’s too much of crowds, too much
of problems, suddenly you become the witness.

487
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:45,773
You start seeing everything.

488
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:49,913
Seeing the problem, what it is.

489
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:54,423
Unless and until you can see the problem you
cannot solve it.

490
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:57,243
Because you are in the problem, you just get
upset.

491
00:55:57,243 --> 00:56:01,143
But if you are out of the problem, you can
see it.

492
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:07,573
And that’s what happens to you when you
become thoughtlessly aware when this center

493
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,193
opens out.

494
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:17,173
Last but not the least is the center of limbic
area which is very important.

495
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:21,923
Now I do not know it has been discovered or
not, but it will be very soon discovered,

496
00:56:21,923 --> 00:56:30,433
that very strong things like cracks and all
that have got sulfuric acid in it, and that

497
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:35,843
doesn’t go anywhere in the body, just rushes
into the limbic area.

498
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:43,263
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which
has got all cells here very sensitive to joy

499
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,453
and happiness.

500
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:52,513
But they become numb, so numb that ordinary
music you cannot hear - somebody has to scream

501
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:57,643
at you, has to shout at you, he has to jump
on it, otherwise you cannot enjoy.

502
00:56:57,643 --> 00:57:03,473
Then it has to be worse and worse and worse
and worse…

503
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:09,113
I don’t know now with cracks, later on they
might develop something even more poisonous,

504
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:16,003
because it has to excite this limbic area
which is such an important thing.

505
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:25,713
But as soon as the Kundalini enters into that
area, limbic area, she soothes it and it opens

506
00:57:25,713 --> 00:57:32,733
- opens like a lotus, thousand petalled lotus.

507
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:42,983
It opens and then the Kundalini emerges out
of your fontanelle bone area and gets connected

508
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:44,703
to the all-pervading power.

509
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,403
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in
your hands.

510
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:51,003
You can feel it all over.

511
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:55,913
Some people in the beginning who felt cool
breeze, could not believe it – so they closed

512
00:57:55,913 --> 00:58:00,503
doors, everything and sat down to see, still
they were feeling it.

513
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:07,983
But it works, works in the sense that you
get empowered.

514
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:15,493
You become peaceful, you become the witness,
you become the wise and you become empowered

515
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:22,243
that you can give realizations to others like
this, that you can raise the Kundalini like

516
00:58:22,243 --> 00:58:25,493
this and you can establish that connection.

517
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:28,333
You can do it.

518
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:32,273
And this is what is your right to have it.

519
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:34,373
This is what will give you meaning.

520
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:41,653
Otherwise so far whatever we have been doing
is very frustrating.

521
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:47,103
Now yesterday I said some questions can be
asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

522
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:50,633
That means you have no questions?

523
00:58:50,633 --> 00:59:25,993
Or there are some questions we can deal with
it for about 5 minutes.

524
00:59:25,993 --> 00:59:33,163
There’s one there, please..

525
00:59:33,163 --> 00:59:54,673
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi
near Mother?) repeats the question:

526
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:59,473
[What is the process by which you one stops
thinking?]

527
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:01,743
It’s very simple.

528
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:09,733
When the Kundalini settles down there, what
happens, as I told you, there is Christ – Christ

529
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:17,893
is awakened and He sucks in these two institutions
which you see there, the yellow and the blue.

530
01:00:17,893 --> 01:00:24,803
These are – one is, the blue one is our
conditioning and the yellow one is our ego.

531
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:28,593
So both these are sucked in like that.

532
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:36,513
These are sucked in because it is said that
He died for our sins, didn’t He?

533
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:37,513
He suffered for us.

534
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:42,483
Now also that’s why yesterday I’ve said
are we going to suffer more than Him?

535
01:00:42,483 --> 01:00:44,773
We don’t have to suffer.

536
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:47,233
Only awaken Him at Agnya.

537
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:51,323
We are all right, this is the process, it
opens out.

538
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:53,343
All right?

539
01:00:53,343 --> 01:01:00,823
That’s why I said you must forgive, because
He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

540
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,543
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why
we do both the things – one in the front

541
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:10,433
and one in the back.

542
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,723
Please get up.

543
01:01:11,723 --> 01:01:17,533
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

544
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:20,534
Automatically, I’ll tell you how.

545
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:24,263
Please, you see like if you have to sprout
a seed you have to just put it in the Mother

546
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,263
Earth.

547
01:01:25,263 --> 01:01:26,263
How do you do it?

548
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:32,823
The Mother Earth has got the capacity and
the seed is built-in within it.

549
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,943
Now it is all built-in within you, all right.

550
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:41,773
And just you are here, I can raise it – anybody
can raise it, those who have got the capacity

551
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:45,893
– Sahaja Yogis can raise your Kundalini
also.

552
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:51,113
[Question from the floor, : You talk about
always thinking.

553
01:01:51,113 --> 01:02:01,043
You talk about, like, if you think too much,
you can actually create illness and the problems

554
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:04,663
in your life.

555
01:02:04,663 --> 01:02:11,003
How do You organize Your time and Your work
and everything, but You don’t think about

556
01:02:11,003 --> 01:02:12,003
it?]

557
01:02:12,003 --> 01:02:14,993
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.

558
01:02:14,993 --> 01:02:16,293
Everything is done by Divine Power.

559
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:27,693
Why should I think – let it think for Me.

560
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:33,033
You see I travel every day – I sleep at
2 o’clock in the night, get up about 5 o’clock

561
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:37,583
in the morning and I travel everywhere.

562
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:42,643
And I’m now 67 years of age, all right,
so what.

563
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:45,743
Divine Power is looking after Me, it’s working
out everything.

564
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:55,233
I am just moving about nicely enjoying everything.

565
01:02:55,233 --> 01:03:06,443
But you have to believe that you can get realization.

566
01:03:06,443 --> 01:03:11,003
You need not believe in the Divine Power,
but you just first believe that you can get

567
01:03:11,003 --> 01:03:14,773
realization and you get it and get in connection
with it.

568
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,033
It just works.

569
01:03:16,033 --> 01:03:18,053
It is the subtlest of subtle.

570
01:03:18,053 --> 01:03:27,773
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we
utilize the divine power in our relationships

571
01:03:27,773 --> 01:03:30,553
and all the problems?]

572
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:36,223
You see first of all you have to give to others.

573
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:41,573
Unless and until you open one door, all right
that’s Divine Power there.

574
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:45,713
But unless and until you open other door,
it won’t come in your life.

575
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:48,333
So you have to open the other door also.

576
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:54,523
There’s where we fail, we want to use Sahaja
Yoga for our own purpose, for our own – my

577
01:03:54,523 --> 01:04:01,713
brother, my sister, my son, all sorts of my,
my, my…

578
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:06,293
There there’s problem – but open it out.

579
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:08,263
Everything works out.

580
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:14,443
You must learn to give.

581
01:04:14,443 --> 01:04:18,183
This is free.

582
01:04:18,183 --> 01:04:25,393

583
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:30,403
It is situated on top of the brain where it
is above the brain, and it is covered with,

584
01:04:30,403 --> 01:04:40,363
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because
I don’t want to quarrel with them.

585
01:04:40,363 --> 01:04:44,063
But there are 1000 nerves which cover it.

586
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:51,963
And when it is enlightened you’ll be surprised,
you’ll see a beautiful lotus opening in

587
01:04:51,963 --> 01:05:07,783
all colors, very very silent flames, and they
are so peace-giving, looks so beautiful.

588
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:16,923
Because when any nerve gets enlightened, the
light of that flame looks like a petal.

589
01:05:16,923 --> 01:05:19,783
It’s very beautiful, it is.

590
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:22,053
But it has to open out.

591
01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:25,553
Just now it is covered by our conditioning
and our ego.

592
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:29,162
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

593
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:34,223
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person
who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

594
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:45,043
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is
also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

595
01:05:45,043 --> 01:06:21,163
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human
being and a realized soul.

596
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:58,743
These are the two stages.

597
01:06:58,743 --> 01:07:01,313
[Question inaudible]

598
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:08,483
You see the thing is that now there are social
conditions which are very bad, people are

599
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,383
homeless, they are on the streets.

600
01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:15,993
Now thinking about it you are not going to
help them, are you?

601
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:16,993
No.

602
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:21,383
Which is the best way is to empower yourself,
all right?

603
01:07:21,383 --> 01:07:31,103
Now see for example, in the villages of India
where I work, people have given them alcohol,

604
01:07:31,103 --> 01:07:37,293
they have given up all bad habits, they have
become very dynamic, they have become very

605
01:07:37,293 --> 01:07:40,543
well off, they are living very well.

606
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:49,293
In London, if you want to work, I am sure
you can get a home, no problem.

607
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:53,903
You see the Asians who have come here, I am
an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

608
01:07:53,903 --> 01:08:01,343
they are becoming very rich, because they
work very hard, very hard, so those who want

609
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,343
to… in London.

610
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,363
But in India it may not be.

611
01:08:04,363 --> 01:08:09,023
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have
improved so much – they have become so dynamic,

612
01:08:09,023 --> 01:08:12,443
they have become so hopeful of life.

613
01:08:12,443 --> 01:08:20,203
But if you just think that life is good for
nothing, let us now drink and be merry then

614
01:08:20,203 --> 01:08:22,413
it won’t work out.

615
01:08:22,413 --> 01:08:27,253
These homeless and all these conditions are
all such – because it is an artificial condition

616
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:34,403
you know, many people have houses but they
don’t want to give it for people to live.

617
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:40,593
Now if those people get transformation, they
won’t behave like that.

618
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:45,843
You see the whole behavior will change when
the emancipation of the society comes up.

619
01:08:45,843 --> 01:08:53,353
But I have seen in the villages of India there’s
a complete transformation.

620
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:59,393
The social conditions are much worse but Indians
are more satisfied people, they are not so

621
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:00,393
much.

622
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:06,353
Here even, supposing you offer a house, they
will say, “No, I don’t like this house.”

623
01:09:06,353 --> 01:09:08,983
You offer a job, they’ll say, “I don’t
want this job.”

624
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:13,333
All these things are there – also too much
of choices.

625
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:19,093
But if you decide, London is not difficult
place I tell you to work hard and get a house,

626
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:21,433
not difficult, they can do it.

627
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:26,743
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

628
01:09:26,743 --> 01:09:31,643
There are so many old people who haven’t
got anybody to help them.

629
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:35,073
But these people will never go and help them.

630
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:36,383
They can earn.

631
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:41,603
This is a place where anybody can earn I think,
because I know people, Asians, who have come

632
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:47,922
here without any money are very rich today
- all have got big big cars, nice houses,

633
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:48,922
this, that.

634
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:51,283
You can see that they are very hardworking.

635
01:09:51,283 --> 01:09:57,023
And then divorces, everybody third day if
you divorce someone what will happen to you?

636
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:59,113
You’ll end up without a home.

637
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:03,213
No respect for the wife, the wife has no respect
for the house.

638
01:10:03,213 --> 01:10:05,433
All upside down society.

639
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:11,403
There’s a big quarrel going on between husband
and wife – how can you have a home with

640
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:13,233
this husband and wife fighting?

641
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:18,043
Even TV if you open, nothing but fighting
- you just don’t want to hear anyone.

642
01:10:18,043 --> 01:10:24,973
See we had to decide on certain things – that
if we have to make a home, then we have to

643
01:10:24,973 --> 01:10:26,973
understand our role in life.

644
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:33,493
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal,
no doubt.

645
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:40,973
But they are like two wheels of a chariot
which has some distance but they are not similar.

646
01:10:40,973 --> 01:10:45,273
And no use fighting with each other – when
you can’t live without each other, why should

647
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:46,273
you fight?

648
01:10:46,273 --> 01:10:48,403
And the children are on the streets.

649
01:10:48,403 --> 01:10:53,773
Every child I find 18 years of age is out
of the house.

650
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:57,172
I mean here the little children are killed
– why?

651
01:10:57,172 --> 01:11:01,323
In India, I cannot think of such a thing.

652
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:10,323
The reason, though they are very poor, the
reason is they know what is love.

653
01:11:10,323 --> 01:11:15,662
And that is what I feel that the society has
to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

654
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:21,553
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga
– I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%.

655
01:11:21,553 --> 01:11:25,803
They have beautiful children, they are living
very well, they have good houses.

656
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:31,343
Those who were really hippies had nothing,
are having nice houses and everything they

657
01:11:31,343 --> 01:11:33,013
have.

658
01:11:33,013 --> 01:11:40,683
Also some of them, were “Oh, so I am now
fortunately, I am without job.”

659
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:43,863
And I said, “What, you are very fortunate?”

660
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:46,172
“Yea, now I am without job.

661
01:11:46,172 --> 01:11:48,662
Very happy about it.”

662
01:11:48,662 --> 01:11:54,672
So I told the gentleman that if you are not
going to stick to one job, you are not going

663
01:11:54,672 --> 01:11:57,843
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

664
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:06,823
And that fellow today has a big car, a nice
wife, children and a house.

665
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:15,653
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must
be given up.

666
01:12:15,653 --> 01:12:19,143
One has to come to a balance and value your
life.

667
01:12:19,143 --> 01:12:23,573
You must value it.

668
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,283
Human life is very valuable.

669
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:42,013
With what great difficulty God has created
you and what are we doing with it?

670
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:50,893
The whole society has to take a turn and think
of living happily – if the husband and wife,

671
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:59,773
I mean such a relationship, husband and wife
cannot live together, then how do we expect

672
01:12:59,773 --> 01:13:02,293
this world to have United Nations?

673
01:13:02,293 --> 01:13:05,973
We cannot – it is falsehood.

674
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:20,003
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we
have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

675
01:13:20,003 --> 01:13:25,123
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand
– fallen in love, now they are rising in

676
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:28,922
love, falling in love again, again falling,
rising in love again… how many times they

677
01:13:28,922 --> 01:13:30,653
fall in love God only knows.

678
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:35,183
It’s a funny stuff going on.

679
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:41,403
We have to face the reality.

680
01:13:41,403 --> 01:13:46,422
So just worrying about these things, what
we should do, is to first of all become wise

681
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,233
and understand the problems.

682
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:52,003
We can all solve it.

683
01:13:52,003 --> 01:13:56,883
It is very simple, it is very simple to solve
the problems.

684
01:13:56,883 --> 01:14:02,223
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

685
01:14:02,223 --> 01:14:09,143
And secondly, that it solves your problems.

686
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:14,652
Just worrying about poor people, it’s also
a kind of a fashion these days.

687
01:14:14,652 --> 01:14:17,543
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met
a lady.

688
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:19,523
She said, “I am very guilty.”

689
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:20,523
I said, “Why?”

690
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:21,523
“Because of Afghanistan.”

691
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,523
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

692
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:25,213
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

693
01:14:25,213 --> 01:14:29,553
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

694
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:30,553
“Nothing.”

695
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:35,193
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing
about it?

696
01:14:35,193 --> 01:14:50,183
But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi finds
out ways and methods of creating a convenient

697
01:14:50,183 --> 01:14:55,973
life – a life where you can earn, you can
live… we do it – we have done, I have

698
01:14:55,973 --> 01:15:02,573
so many examples.

699
01:15:02,573 --> 01:15:05,763
Because it’s a collective life also you
help each other.

700
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:12,493
We didn’t have rich people in Sahaja Yoga
many because they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga.

701
01:15:12,493 --> 01:15:17,353
They go to false gurus because they can purchase
the guru – they can’t purchase Me.

702
01:15:17,353 --> 01:15:21,223
So mostly the rich never come here.

703
01:15:21,223 --> 01:15:25,193
Bureaucrats also don’t come, politicians
don’t come.

704
01:15:25,193 --> 01:15:31,543
So those people who come to Me are the people
who can easily solve the problem because they

705
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:39,863
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

706
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:48,983
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My
husband was not so for it – everybody said,

707
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:51,173
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”

708
01:15:51,173 --> 01:16:00,013
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey,
and a woman, I just said I must go.

709
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:04,585
But I was surprised, they worshipped Mother,
they worshipped their mothers.

710
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:08,703
And they were so beautiful – so many.

711
01:16:08,703 --> 01:16:14,303
In one shot, we got 70 people – serious
Sahaja Yogis.

712
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:20,053
But do you know when I reached there, people
from America, from Australia, from all over

713
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:24,723
the world arrived there in Turkey to help
Me.

714
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:30,973
I mean I was so enamored to see My children
coming, arriving there on their own - those

715
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:33,193
who could afford it.

716
01:16:33,193 --> 01:16:37,013
And the Turkish people were so beautiful,
I tell you.

717
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:41,053
I found they are the same everywhere.

718
01:16:41,053 --> 01:16:49,803
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell
you, otherwise we are just the same.

719
01:16:49,803 --> 01:17:04,053
So all these problems can be easily solved
– there’s nothing so serious about it.

720
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:32,703
There is

721
01:17:32,703 --> 01:17:48,323
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and
until you are connected, it is like telephoning

722
01:17:48,323 --> 01:17:51,403
without connection.

723
01:17:51,403 --> 01:18:00,093
There are people in India who’ll go on saying
“Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama” like that.

724
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,912
And the chakra of Rama itself will be caught.

725
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:09,513
They’ll be saying “Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva”
and the heart chakra, where Shiva resides,

726
01:18:09,513 --> 01:18:11,602
it will be caught.

727
01:18:11,602 --> 01:18:22,013
The reason is, supposing you want to meet
the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

728
01:18:22,013 --> 01:18:27,183
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested!

729
01:18:27,183 --> 01:18:37,453
And you’ll end up in a jail!

730
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:47,533
So you must have some connection, there should
be some protocol.

731
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:53,983
Now if it is for kings and prime ministers,
what about God?

732
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:58,913
He’s not in your pocket.

733
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:02,283
But once you are realized, even once you take
the name, it is sufficient.

734
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:03,843
What is there?

735
01:19:03,843 --> 01:19:07,083
He’s at your disposal all the time there.

736
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,823
But you have to have connection.

737
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:15,783
Now you are the citizens say of England, or
some place, all right so your government is

738
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:16,873
looking after you.

739
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:20,153
Whether you are satisfied or not is not the
point.

740
01:19:20,153 --> 01:19:22,103
But they are looking after you.

741
01:19:22,103 --> 01:19:29,723
But if you enter into the Kingdom of God,
then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.

742
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:37,553
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things
work out.

743
01:19:37,553 --> 01:20:13,973
So amazing

744
01:20:13,973 --> 01:20:19,563
it is, so amazing.

745
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:25,243
See first of all they say Kundalini has to
rise.

746
01:20:25,243 --> 01:20:32,513
Then it sometimes comes back to the centers
which are needing more help.

747
01:20:32,513 --> 01:20:40,513
So it is like a rope you can say, which has
many strings in it, very thin ones just like

748
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:45,833
a hair, and one by one they open out.

749
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:54,553
So first, very few of them pierce through,
open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

750
01:20:54,553 --> 01:20:57,173
and the chakras open out more.

751
01:20:57,173 --> 01:20:59,743
It goes on like that.

752
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:07,413
But once you are connected properly then there’s
no problem.

753
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:11,893
But it is instantaneous, no doubt about it.

754
01:21:11,893 --> 01:21:18,413
But for that you have to come to our centers,
don’t have to pay anything, just spend some

755
01:21:18,413 --> 01:21:25,003
time and you have to master it, that’s all.

756
01:21:25,003 --> 01:21:33,523
There’s a question, what purpose do we have
on this planet?

757
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:47,843
The purpose of our existence is to prove that
God’s creation is the most successful thing.

758
01:21:47,843 --> 01:21:52,373
That’s the purpose.

759
01:21:52,373 --> 01:22:14,022
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry.

760
01:22:14,022 --> 01:22:19,073
You better get your realization and try to
find out about Me, because those who have

761
01:22:19,073 --> 01:22:23,042
talked - you see human beings are mad people,
you don’t know.

762
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:27,803
Christ said “I am the Son of God” – which
He was no doubt.

763
01:22:27,803 --> 01:22:32,973
And He saidthat, “I am the door” – which
He was, no doubt.

764
01:22:32,973 --> 01:22:34,183
But they crucified Him.

765
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:37,403
They gave poison to Mohammed Sahib.

766
01:22:37,403 --> 01:22:39,703
They killed so many saints.

767
01:22:39,703 --> 01:22:44,913
I know human beings very well, so please I
am not going to talk to you about Myself at

768
01:22:44,913 --> 01:22:45,973
all.

769
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:51,292
You better get your self-realization - try
to know Me.

770
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:59,793
Because I have to do some jobs, all right
and for that, I want to live.

771
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:03,303
People are really sometimes so funny.

772
01:23:03,303 --> 01:23:08,933
Even otherwise they behave in such a funny
manner that I can’t understand.

773
01:23:08,933 --> 01:23:13,513
As if I am going to take away their property
or something.

774
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:20,513
I am here to give you something that is very
important.

775
01:23:20,513 --> 01:23:40,993
Sort of you can say I am here to complete
the work of Christ, Mohammed and all of them.

776
01:23:40,993 --> 01:23:57,883
Yes please….

777
01:23:57,883 --> 01:24:09,103
When you will give to others, you will receive
the blessings.

778
01:24:09,103 --> 01:24:12,663
That’s what it is absolutely 100%.

779
01:24:12,663 --> 01:24:15,663
He said so many things.

780
01:24:15,663 --> 01:24:23,123
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout
I think.

781
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:33,913
[Question inaudible]

782
01:24:33,913 --> 01:24:47,873
That

783
01:24:47,873 --> 01:24:50,983
should not be the question just now, all right.

784
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:54,993
Because to say anything about it, you know
what happens with people.

785
01:24:54,993 --> 01:25:02,123
So this can be discussed later on, when we
get our self-realization.

786
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:09,463
Certain things at a level can be discussed
and this is what happened with all of them

787
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:15,203
because they had very little time to talk
to you.

788
01:25:15,203 --> 01:25:26,093
And that’s why everything has been misinterpreted,
misused, because to understand the truth,

789
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:32,013
to bear it also, one has to have self-realization.

790
01:25:32,013 --> 01:25:33,753
This I have found out.

791
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:39,763
If you are not a self realized person you
can’t bear the truth, you cannot – it’s

792
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:52,833
too much for human mind to grasp and to allow
it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.

793
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:56,153
Truth is too much for them.

794
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:59,873
So the first thing should be that we get our
self-realization.

795
01:25:59,873 --> 01:26:01,673
Yes, my child…

796
01:26:01,673 --> 01:26:03,473
[Initial question inaudible.

797
01:26:03,473 --> 01:26:09,113
Mother: Can you get up, please?

798
01:26:09,113 --> 01:26:15,643
Questioner: Yes, of course

799
01:26:15,643 --> 01:26:20,542
Mother: Thank you.

800
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:33,233
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change
all the time?[…

801
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:34,803
INAUDIBLE]

802
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:39,033
But the auras you see sometimes are these
colors only.

803
01:26:39,033 --> 01:26:43,303
But sometimes you are more strong with one
center, so that color shows.

804
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:50,292
They do not change, they are just the same.

805
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:54,993
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so
we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

806
01:26:54,993 --> 01:27:01,673
us finish with our self-realization which
is going to take only 10 minutes.

807
01:27:01,673 --> 01:27:07,633
Those who do not want to have should please
leave, they should not sit here and just watch

808
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:08,733
other people.

809
01:27:08,733 --> 01:27:15,213
That’s the only kindness I request of them
– that if you do not want to have self-realization,

810
01:27:15,213 --> 01:27:18,663
it’s better that you should leave.

811
01:27:18,663 --> 01:27:24,173
Those people who are standing, could not get
place, can come here or you can also give

812
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:28,283
them places if you want to give some places.

813
01:27:28,283 --> 01:27:33,513
No, not for Sahaja Yogis, I said for others
– for others, for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis

814
01:27:33,513 --> 01:27:34,673
can stand up.

815
01:27:34,673 --> 01:28:17,793
At the very outset you have to now understand
that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

816
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:28,442
of God and hence we have to little bit unload
ourselves.

817
01:28:28,442 --> 01:28:41,703
One of the conditions is that we should not
feel guilty – one should not feel guilty

818
01:28:41,703 --> 01:28:42,703
at all.

819
01:28:42,703 --> 01:28:46,253
Yesterday, same problem I said, but you were
still feeling guilty.

820
01:28:46,253 --> 01:28:47,803
Also it’s a fashion.

821
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:52,253
Also I think the language is such – all
the time sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry…

822
01:28:52,253 --> 01:28:57,093
Even when we used to receive telephones we
used to say “I beg your pardon.”

823
01:28:57,093 --> 01:28:59,753
But now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten
times sorry.

824
01:28:59,753 --> 01:29:05,053
What is there to be so sorry?

825
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:07,973
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards
ourselves.

826
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:09,763
We have to respect ourselves.

827
01:29:09,763 --> 01:29:12,843
We have to be happy about ourselves.

828
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:20,573
This is first thing is not to feel guilty
about anything - just believe that you have

829
01:29:20,573 --> 01:29:27,703
done nothing wrong which cannot be dissolved
by this great power of forgiveness.

830
01:29:27,703 --> 01:29:31,293
Please believe Me.

831
01:29:31,293 --> 01:29:37,493
But if you want to stick onto a feeling like
that – “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s

832
01:29:37,493 --> 01:29:38,643
only mental.

833
01:29:38,643 --> 01:29:46,143
Animals don’t feel guilty about anything
– a dog will bark, tiger will eat anything

834
01:29:46,143 --> 01:29:47,763
that it wants to.

835
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:52,143
It’s only human beings who feel that way
– that I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done

836
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:53,143
that wrong.

837
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:58,453
All right, so not to feel guilty that’s
one point.

838
01:29:58,453 --> 01:30:09,973
The second one is to forgive everyone, which
is very difficult for many people.

839
01:30:09,973 --> 01:30:17,223
I don’t know how many mounds of unhappiness
is in the head because we cannot forgive.

840
01:30:17,223 --> 01:30:22,333
Mounds, it’s not kilos and kilos.

841
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:31,103
Yesterday I found most of them had not forgiven
and I had to go on putting balm on their heads

842
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:32,823
to take out.

843
01:30:32,823 --> 01:30:35,513
So you must cooperate.

844
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:40,093
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

845
01:30:40,093 --> 01:30:44,103
First of all forgive yourself and forgive
everyone.

846
01:30:44,103 --> 01:30:49,623
And be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

847
01:30:49,623 --> 01:30:52,763
There’s no Greek tragedy going on here – no
tragedy.

848
01:30:52,763 --> 01:31:03,463
We are in a very beautiful atmosphere and
we are going to go into the most beautiful

849
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:07,353
area within ourselves, that is our spirit.

850
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:12,573
So we have to be very light about it.

851
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:21,883
All right, with all this understanding, I
have to request you that we have to take out

852
01:31:21,883 --> 01:31:29,252
your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us a lot.

853
01:31:29,252 --> 01:31:49,963
And not to be serious – not to be serious
about it.

854
01:31:49,963 --> 01:32:03,783
It’s not frivolous, but it’s fun.

855
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:22,053
So you have to put your left hand towards
Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

856
01:32:22,053 --> 01:32:28,743
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down
it would be very nice.

857
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:32,033
Please be seated and don’t move about.

858
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:38,303
Left hand towards Me like that – be comfortable,
if you want you can put it on your lap or

859
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,283
you can put it up if you want to.

860
01:32:40,283 --> 01:32:53,263
Then the right hand needs to be used for nourishing
your centers on the left-hand side.

861
01:32:53,263 --> 01:32:57,583
Now I’ll show you how we’ll be nourishing.

862
01:32:57,583 --> 01:33:02,143
Before that, please remember that put your
both the feet apart from each other – not

863
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:06,013
too much, but slightly.

864
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:12,133
Now, left hand towards Me.

865
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:19,403
I’ll show you before and then we can close
our eyes and work it out.

866
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:32,243
Put your right hand on your heart – in the
heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

867
01:33:32,243 --> 01:33:40,473
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi
Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

868
01:33:40,473 --> 01:33:45,502
reflection of God Almighty.

869
01:33:45,502 --> 01:33:53,323
So we put our attention to our heart first.

870
01:33:53,323 --> 01:34:01,303
Then we take our right hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen on the left-hand side and press

871
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:02,613
it hard.

872
01:34:02,613 --> 01:34:06,973
This is the center of our mastery.

873
01:34:06,973 --> 01:34:16,013
We take down our right hand on the lower portion
of our abdomen and press it hard.

874
01:34:16,013 --> 01:34:27,533
This is the center of pure knowledge that
manifests on our central nervous system.

875
01:34:27,533 --> 01:34:37,203
We take back our hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen.

876
01:34:37,203 --> 01:34:46,103
And again we take it in the heart, in the
upper portion of our heart.

877
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:55,134
Then we take it in the corner of our neck
and our shoulder and put your head to the

878
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:57,813
right.

879
01:34:57,813 --> 01:35:06,873
This is the center we catch when we feel guilty.

880
01:35:06,873 --> 01:35:21,533
Then we take our hand on our forehead and
slowly bring down our head on it to rest.

881
01:35:21,533 --> 01:35:32,643
Here we press it on both the sides and this
is the center to forgive.

882
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:46,453
We take back our hand on the back side of
our head and put our head resting on it - this

883
01:35:46,453 --> 01:35:52,303
is the center for asking forgiveness without
feeling guilty.

884
01:35:52,303 --> 01:36:02,573
We stretch our hand, with the center of our
palm, we put it on our head in the soft bone

885
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:11,343
area of our childhood, called as fontanelle
bone area, and slowly we put down our head.

886
01:36:11,343 --> 01:36:26,473
Here we stretch our fingers and move our scalp
carefully with pressure, slowly, clockwise,

887
01:36:26,473 --> 01:36:32,433
seven times.

888
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:50,973
That’s all we have to do.

889
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:59,613
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them until I ask you to open because attention

890
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:01,373
has to go inside.

891
01:37:01,373 --> 01:37:04,103
Put your left hand towards Me.

892
01:37:04,103 --> 01:37:09,313
Now first you will feel thoughtless – so
don’t fight with your thoughts.

893
01:37:09,313 --> 01:37:11,493
Automatically everything will work out.

894
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:19,723
Don’t fight with your thoughts, just keep
watching and ultimately you will feel cool

895
01:37:19,723 --> 01:37:24,733
breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone
area and you’ll also start feeling cool

896
01:37:24,733 --> 01:37:31,253
breeze all around you which is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze of the

897
01:37:31,253 --> 01:37:41,453
all-pervading power as described by Adi Shankaracharya,
Salilam, salilam – it’s cool, and cool.

898
01:37:41,453 --> 01:37:54,473
So now, we put our left hand this way towards
Me and the right hand on the heart.

899
01:37:54,473 --> 01:38:03,853
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental
question, three times – “Mother, am I

900
01:38:03,853 --> 01:38:05,553
the Spirit?”

901
01:38:05,553 --> 01:38:14,553
In your heart, ask the question “Mother,
am I the Spirit?”

902
01:38:14,553 --> 01:38:26,173
If you are the spirit you are your master,
because in the light of your spirit you know

903
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:30,783
what is right and what is wrong – you can
guide yourself.

904
01:38:30,783 --> 01:38:37,563
So put your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

905
01:38:37,563 --> 01:38:48,353
here please ask Me a question again three
times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

906
01:38:48,353 --> 01:38:57,853
“Mother, am I my own master?”

907
01:38:57,853 --> 01:39:08,813
As I have told you that I will not cross your
freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

908
01:39:08,813 --> 01:39:18,693
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge
on yourself, otherwise I cannot.

909
01:39:18,693 --> 01:39:26,613
So please put your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen and ask the question,

910
01:39:26,613 --> 01:39:41,343
“Mother” - or you can request “Mother
please give me pure knowledge.”

911
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:49,613
Say this six times because this center has
got six petals.

912
01:39:49,613 --> 01:40:01,883
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

913
01:40:01,883 --> 01:40:14,163
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints
and seers have built up for us a center of

914
01:40:14,163 --> 01:40:16,353
mastery.

915
01:40:16,353 --> 01:40:26,893
But to open the center we have to have all
the confidence, so please raise your hand

916
01:40:26,893 --> 01:40:38,522
and put it in the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left-hand side and say with full confidence

917
01:40:38,522 --> 01:40:51,863
to nourish this center, ten times, “Mother,
I am my own master.”

918
01:40:51,863 --> 01:41:04,733
Please say this ten times.

919
01:41:04,733 --> 01:41:18,143
Now we have to know that we are not this body,
we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

920
01:41:18,143 --> 01:41:22,953
we are not this intellect.

921
01:41:22,953 --> 01:41:27,763
We are not our conditionings or are we our
ego.

922
01:41:27,763 --> 01:41:32,213
We are pure spirit.

923
01:41:32,213 --> 01:41:41,813
So now raise your hand to your heart and with
full confidence say twelve times “Mother,

924
01:41:41,813 --> 01:41:43,883
I am the spirit.”

925
01:41:43,883 --> 01:41:53,763
Please say twelve times, “Mother, I am the
spirit.”

926
01:41:53,763 --> 01:42:07,603
You have to know that this Divine Power is
the ocean of love and compassion.

927
01:42:07,603 --> 01:42:18,443
It is the ocean of joy and bliss but above
all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so there

928
01:42:18,443 --> 01:42:27,522
is no mistake that you have committed which
cannot be dissolved by this ocean.

929
01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:37,693
So please forgive yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

930
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:41,893
and turn your head to your right.

931
01:42:41,893 --> 01:42:56,593
Here you have to say with complete confidence
again, “Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at

932
01:42:56,593 --> 01:42:57,593
all.”

933
01:42:57,593 --> 01:43:16,173
Or you can call Me Mother – “Mother, I
am not guilty at all.”

934
01:43:16,173 --> 01:43:31,613
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

935
01:43:31,613 --> 01:43:44,853
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

936
01:43:44,853 --> 01:43:47,033
– it’s a myth.

937
01:43:47,033 --> 01:43:51,783
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands.

938
01:43:51,783 --> 01:44:03,543
So put your right hand on your forehead and
please bend your head, resting on the hand

939
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:09,713
as much as you can and now press it on both
the sides.

940
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:18,433
And here please, please, say it from your
heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

941
01:44:18,433 --> 01:44:27,292
Please say it from your heart - please say
it, otherwise again I will have to work very

942
01:44:27,292 --> 01:44:28,333
hard on you.

943
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:33,433
So please say it from your heart – “Mother,
I forgive everyone.”

944
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:40,723
You are not going to miss your self-realization
for not forgiving, please.

945
01:44:40,723 --> 01:44:56,433
How many lives you have been seeking the truth
that this time you are not going to miss it

946
01:44:56,433 --> 01:44:57,433
out.

947
01:44:57,433 --> 01:45:50,873
Now take back your hand on the back side of
your head and push back

948
01:45:50,873 --> 01:47:57,033
your head as much as you can resting on
your

949
01:47:57,033 --> 01:48:27,443
hand

950
01:48:27,443 --> 01:48:51,123
and here for your own satisfaction, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

951
01:48:51,123 --> 01:49:09,803
please say, “Oh Divine, if

952
01:49:09,803 --> 01:49:42,213
I

953
01:49:42,213 --> 01:50:07,292
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

954
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:26,013
TAPE ENDS
