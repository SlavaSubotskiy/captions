1
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:58,513
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:09,993
At the very outset we have to understand that truth is what it is.

3
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:12,523
We cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:16,673
We cannot organize it.

5
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:21,353
And we cannot use it for our own purposes.

6
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:31,573
Moreover, with the blinkers on both the sides like a horse, with all our conditionings,

7
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,903
we cannot find the truth.

8
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,073
We have to be free people.

9
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:46,473
We have to be open-minded people, like scientists, to see for ourselves what is the truth.

10
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:56,303
If somebody preaches something, professes something, says something, is not to be accepted

11
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,993
blindfolded.

12
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:07,013
As I told you yesterday, that the essence of all the religions is to find the eternal

13
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:16,683
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding and in its own limitations.

14
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,663
That’s why we have lost our balance.

15
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:35,293
If we are really the people who want to know the truth, we have to know that at human awareness

16
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,433
we cannot know it.

17
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:42,542
It becomes a concept.

18
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:51,123
You have to have the spiritual awareness, but spiritual awareness is a state of your

19
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:55,943
being, where you become the spirit.

20
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,193
Again the word I’ll say – “become.”

21
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:05,863
It’s not artificially certifying somebody that now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

22
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:09,023
or a Muslim, you become anything.

23
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:16,523
Because you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, anything, you can commit any sin.

24
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,783
You can do anything that is wrong.

25
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:25,143
Nothing from inside is going to stop you.

26
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:32,553
So all these things have become so much outward that now there are people who have started

27
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:40,393
saying there is no God, there is nothing like religion, which is not true.

28
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:48,583
First of all when we say there is nothing, or there is not God, we should find out, have

29
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:57,823
we been able to find out about it or just in our ego we are saying there is no God?

30
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:03,673
Have we been able to work it out to see if there is God or not?

31
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:08,433
You do not judge God by the people who talk about God.

32
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:14,403
Anybody can talk about God because they think there’s no law that can catch them.

33
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:19,293
They can talk against Him, they can talk for Him, they can do the way they like.

34
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:24,453
They can even make money by talking against God and against all the prophets – that’s

35
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:30,183
a very good way of making money, blackmail.

36
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:37,893
But does that mean that whatever is written is a bible, or whatever is black and white,

37
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:43,043
is to be taken that seriously?

38
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:52,333
So first of all, we have to be little independent to be free, to know that if you have to know

39
00:14:52,453 --> 00:15:00,433
the spirit - as they said “know thyself” - then you have to know it on your central

40
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,153
nervous system.

41
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:17,643
As I can feel this is cold or hot, you have to feel the divine power which is all-pervading,

42
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:27,803
which is the truth, which manifests the truth, because it is the love of God.

43
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:38,263
You have to first feel it on your central nervous system, which is the bodha.

44
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:46,203
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced so much, all right.

45
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:50,773
We have gone too far with everything.

46
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:57,993
But if we see, when we started with science, what have we produced?

47
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:04,583
Hydrogen bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils sitting on our heads.

48
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:12,453
You take to any enterprise that we did, we go to extremes.

49
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:15,183
There is no balance.

50
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:21,572
Any mental projection is linear, it moves in one line and then recoils back, and then

51
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,072
you are shocked.

52
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,833
Now you have got acid rain.

53
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:28,203
You produced machinery, all right.

54
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:33,253
Machinery is for you, you are not for machinery.

55
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:42,123
And thus, there is no balance between you and the machinery, no balance between you

56
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:43,123
and the science.

57
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:50,313
It is just like going amok with anything that you get into your hand.

58
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:58,183
And this balance you can only have when you become the spirit.

59
00:16:58,303 --> 00:17:05,063
You see beautiful chandeliers here, beautifully made, but unless and until there is light

60
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:09,693
what is the meaning of these chandeliers?

61
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,523
Nothing.

62
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:19,203
In the same way, if you do not have the light of the spirit shining in your attention, you

63
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,743
will not know your meaning.

64
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:26,413
Like this instrument – unless and until it is connected to the mains, it is useless.

65
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:34,033
Unless and until we are connected to the mains, we do not know the absolute, and that’s

66
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,243
why all these problems are there.

67
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:50,813
Now when I am talking about this instrument, which lies within us, one has to again know

68
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:56,723
that this is the knowledge of the roots.

69
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:00,623
And to know the knowledge of the roots, you have to become a subtler personality.

70
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:05,803
With a gross mind, you cannot see it.

71
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:12,813
To become the subtler personality, minimum of minimum, you have to know that so far you

72
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,613
have not known the roots.

73
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,813
If you had known, there would be no problem.

74
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:30,693
But there’s something has gone wrong somewhere in every human enterprise, even in religions,

75
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:40,943
that’s why today we find this kind of a farce going on.

76
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:48,483
And what is gone wrong is that we have to seek the eternal.

77
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:56,443
Maybe it might look a little different, for example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

78
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,823
God at all.

79
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:07,663
I also did not talk about God for four years, at least three years.

80
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:14,512
As soon as you talk of God, again people start jumping, “When can we become God?” – this

81
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:18,233
is the first question.

82
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:21,693
So first you become the self –the first step.

83
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,582
That’s why they did not talk.

84
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:28,303
They said first you become yourself.

85
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:36,183
Unless and until you have your eyes, how can you see the colors?

86
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,433
So first have your eyes.

87
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:51,263
It is for your benevolence that you better get what you deserve, what is your own.

88
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:57,343
It’s your birthright as a human being to become the spirit.

89
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,803
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha means “with” and ja is “born.”

90
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:11,993
Born with you is the right to get this yoga, is the union with the Divine.

91
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:16,693
It’s your birthright as a human being.

92
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:21,823
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

93
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:31,533
And it has to work out, but please open your hearts and open your minds.

94
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,133
Just open it and see for yourself, it will work, I know.

95
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,593
Yesterday it has worked.

96
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,303
It is going to work out today also.

97
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:45,053
But by thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.

98
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:56,193
This is the biggest problem of our seeking that we run after some sort of a concept.

99
00:20:56,313 --> 00:21:03,353
Now here you have seen this instrument is the most beautiful instrument that is created

100
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:08,693
within us during the process of our evolution.

101
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:16,663
The first one is the most beautiful one because it stands for our innocence.

102
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:24,933
This innocence is the one which gives us real support, real strength.

103
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:30,493
And you’ll be surprised it is never destroyed.

104
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:37,853
It may be overshadowed, there may be clouds.

105
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:41,953
Maybe it may look to be a very dark sky.

106
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,223
Maybe a hopeless case.

107
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:48,072
Some people might say that we have destroyed our innocence.

108
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:52,253
It cannot be destroyed.

109
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:58,103
Whatever you might have done, this is one center which cannot be destroyed.

110
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:02,203
You may have problems with it but it cannot be destroyed.

111
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:08,653
It is such a wonderful center you have got, which has got four petals, which looks after

112
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:15,983
the pelvic plexus, looks after all the excretion within us.

113
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:25,933
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds of things which may not be benevolent for

114
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,392
ourselves, doesn’t matter.

115
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:44,892
Kundalini cannot be destroyed - the source which is going to give you the self-realization,

116
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:48,683
I say She is your individual Mother.

117
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:55,643
And this Mother is such a loving Mother and She knows each and everything about you - from

118
00:22:55,763 --> 00:23:01,183
your past, from your past lives - She knows you very well.

119
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:09,353
She is just waiting for a chance that She can be awakened and She can give you your

120
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:10,663
second birth.

121
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:16,343
When you were born, your mother suffered for you – you did not suffer.

122
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:21,903
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

123
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,093
is all falsehood.

124
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,353
Absolutely falsehood.

125
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:33,723
And it is so absurd that how can a mother give you problems?

126
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:40,603
I mean, I don’t know about some mothers are funny also – that’s all human problems.

127
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,593
But this is a Divine Mother.

128
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,413
She’s not going to give you trouble.

129
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:55,473
But these problems that have come are coming from people who have no authority, who have

130
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:59,473
no education, who do not know what Kundalini is.

131
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:05,473
Some say it is in the stomach, some say in the head, some say in the legs.

132
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:12,153
Those who have no character of their own, because they have to be pure people themselves,

133
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:18,512
try all kinds of nonsensical tricks and create problems on the sympathetic nervous system

134
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:26,363
and they call it as something that it is the problem of the Kundalini.

135
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:30,303
Kundalini will never give you any problems.

136
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:36,343
On the contrary, when She rises and when you get your awakening, the first thing that is

137
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:39,343
established is thoughtless awareness.

138
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:50,882
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

139
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:56,192
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.

140
00:24:56,312 --> 00:25:05,233
It makes you stop in the present and you grow in the present, and the thoughts, if you want

141
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:09,832
to think you can think, if you don’t want to think, it is not like a madhouse going

142
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:16,142
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop it.

143
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:24,263
This works out with the Kundalini’s awakening when She crosses this center of ours, which

144
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,192
we call as Agnya chakra.

145
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:29,813
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers about Christ.

146
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:36,403
Let us see what people have to say about Christ in other shastras and scriptures.

147
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:41,203
Who was He?

148
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:47,313
Because people did not allow Him to manifest for more than four years and in four years

149
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,622
what can you do?

150
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:52,072
You cannot do anything.

151
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:58,753
I must tell you in London I came, My husband was selected for a job and that’s how we

152
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:05,873
are here, and for four years I was struggling with seven of them, just struggling.

153
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:11,033
Giving realization was such a difficult subject to the English people at that time.

154
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,213
They are hard nuts, I know.

155
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,763
But once they break, they are the best.

156
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,723
I think the best are the hardest.

157
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:25,723
And it worked, it clicked.

158
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:34,572
I am surprised that I had to work very hard but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

159
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:39,543
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly also – a lot of scholarship in them.

160
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:46,352
Found out all about Kundalini, everything from wherever – your libraries are so well-equipped.

161
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,533
And I was surprised, it was all there.

162
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,153
They studied Sanskrit.

163
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:59,463
Now can you imagine these people English singing Sanskrit song with that speed?

164
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:04,153
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi when they were in India.

165
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:09,923
Three hundred years they were there, they could not speak one sentence you will be surprised.

166
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:14,553
We had to tell them in English how to speak Hindi.

167
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:21,423
Like you have to say “open the door” – is in Hindi, is darwaja khol do.

168
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:22,423
They couldn’t say it.

169
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:27,413
So we had to say, “there was a banker” or something like that – means “close

170
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,842
the door” – “there was a banker.”

171
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:32,393
They couldn’t speak Hindi.

172
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,503
Sanskrit is very far off.

173
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,592
And now look at them, what has happened to them.

174
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:44,193
And Indian music is such a difficult music, you have to really, it is a question of penance,

175
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:45,273
tremendous penance.

176
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:51,143
Now we have people who play beautiful tabla, beautiful instruments not only but sing so

177
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,143
well.

178
00:27:52,263 --> 00:28:00,343
Swiss, the hardest nuts you can ever think of, they are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss

179
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:09,323
the way they sing, tremendous manifestation in such a short time.

180
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:15,273
Of course they can also sing English very well, they know English music very well, or

181
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,493
should say Western music very well.

182
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,822
But to learn this difficult melodies of India is remarkable.

183
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:25,873
I am myself surprised at this.

184
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:33,883
So what happens in the second center when it enters, you just become dynamic, because

185
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,713
the second center is for aesthetics and for creativity.

186
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:48,663
Now we have, like My brother who was a chartered accountant, he was very bad at all the languages.

187
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,403
Very bad, of course Sanskrit was out of question.

188
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:58,243
Now he is making poetry in Sanskrit and in Urdu language and also in Marathi, which is

189
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,243
the most difficult language.

190
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:02,293
This is the second center.

191
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:09,463
When Kundalini nourishes that center, like a very beautiful Mother she nourishes.

192
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:17,542
You must have heard about some great artists – Amjad Ali, he was here – after realization

193
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:19,023
he became such a great artist.

194
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:21,403
There are so many artists.

195
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:23,312
In India, they understand.

196
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:24,893
They want to sing before Me.

197
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,833
I mean I don’t know how to say that now only one person can sing.

198
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:37,483
Because their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

199
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:46,133
At the same time, that person becomes very mild, very sweet, very compassionate.

200
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:49,743
Like there’s one great singer.

201
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:53,273
She’s a Muslim lady, I will not name her.

202
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:56,923
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

203
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:59,042
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

204
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,102
So she came down.

205
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:07,993
And the lady who was playing harmonium – she came and told Me, “This lady is just an

206
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:15,433
atom bomb, You don’t know how she gets angry if there’s one note I play wrong.”

207
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:21,292
I saw her but she was very silently playing – nothing doing, she never got angry with

208
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:22,292
anyone.

209
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:26,483
So in the interval, this lady comes and tells Me, “That see in Your presence, I don’t

210
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:29,433
know what has happened to this lady.

211
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:33,342
This tiger has become like a cow.

212
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,793
How is it?”

213
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:38,203
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

214
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:47,542
So this violence, this anger, this temper is not your creation, it’s the creation

215
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:48,743
of your liver.

216
00:30:48,863 --> 00:31:00,183
Your liver is little out of order because of many things, and the temper is there.

217
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:03,743
Now when the temper is too much, you don’t know what to do.

218
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,213
I mean you can do whatever you like.

219
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:10,572
In your temper after all, it’s like a drunken personality.

220
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:15,623
You have to approach a person in a temper with a barge pole.

221
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:20,433
But all this temper, everything, becomes so cool and so beautiful.

222
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:23,463
It’s very surprising.

223
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:32,153
A very dynamic person becomes extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate, and I’ve had such

224
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:41,683
beautiful experiences of their compassion that it’s not easy to describe.

225
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:49,223
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities which has got a trait like this and a trait

226
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:53,383
like that, everything dissolves.

227
00:31:53,503 --> 00:32:02,483
Everything dissolves because of this center which is so creative and which also gives

228
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:09,433
you the manifestation of pure knowledge - pure knowledge.

229
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:16,352
For example you start feeling on your finger tips – you just start feeling on your finger

230
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,352
tips.

231
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:24,243
Like today only, somebody came and told Me, “That Mataji my Agnya is catching.”

232
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:30,403
Agnya is this center - means “I’ve got my ego on.”

233
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,542
Will anybody say like that?

234
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:36,283
On the contrary if you tell somebody, “You have got your ego,” they’ll show you that

235
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,082
they have their ego on.

236
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:42,173
It’s very dangerous to say to somebody that your ego is on.

237
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:48,513
But just because of self knowledge - pure knowledge - you know that this Mr. Ego is

238
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:59,033
sitting here and I cannot cross through and there’s a blockage here, which I have to

239
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:00,183
take it out.

240
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:04,443
It’s so innate within you, everything, only thing is your connection has to be made.

241
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:08,653
Once the connection is made, immediately you know about yourself.

242
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:20,623
And this center which is responsible for creating all kinds of funny thoughts and horrible creativity

243
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:26,513
becomes so benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

244
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:34,653
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these people who could not even say one word in

245
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:41,543
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit and this - specially the one they sang, the

246
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:48,953
first one - many Indians cannot sing that way I can tell you, they can’t.

247
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,633
It’s not easy.

248
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:54,993
It’s a very great tongue twister first of all the language is.

249
00:33:55,113 --> 00:34:02,503
Apart from that, to sing in such a correct pronunciation is so difficult but they have

250
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,903
done it.

251
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:13,983
So in Sahaja Yoga, an artist who is struggling today may become a great artist tomorrow.

252
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:18,293
But still I would say these are temptations.

253
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:23,123
You’ll become a great artist, you’ll start earning more money, this, that…but that’s

254
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:24,523
not the one.

255
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:30,393
You have to really be satisfied with, you will never be satisfied with that.

256
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:37,693
So you move to the third center which we call as the Nabhi chakra.

257
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:46,943
This center is, on one side, is made of water and another side with fire.

258
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:59,192
Around it are our ten valencies, which we can call as our innate religion within ourselves.

259
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:05,699
Now this Nabhi itself, or we can call the solar plexus

260
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:11,681
or we can say the Navel chakra

261
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:17,821
gives us, as soon as the Kundalini rises,

262
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:20,972
she awakens this and the light when it spreads,

263
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,504
you become religious.

264
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:27,323
I don’t have to tell you anything, you just become.

265
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:31,489
I don’t have to say that you don’t take drugs, you just don’t take it.

266
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,998
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

267
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,093
Overnight, alcoholism. Overnight, everything.

268
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:42,664
And they enjoy their virtues.
That’s the best part of it.

269
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:45,370
Some people think, well then what is the fun?

270
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:53,683
What is this that you take something in the pub and next day you have hangover.

271
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:58,917
Here you take something and next day you are much better off.

272
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:03,520
It never comes down. It never gives you a reaction.

273
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:07,313
It’s not artificial.
It’s not intoxicating.

274
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:12,130
It is from your nerves it’s bubbling out.

275
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:15,709
So this is the center which is very important in us

276
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,672
because most of us have a problem with
this center.

277
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:29,797
And here we have a capacity by this center

278
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:38,226
that we enjoy our generosity.

279
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:45,366
Now all matter whatever it is -
we are materialistic, materialistic,

280
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:48,254
it is a good idea to be materialistic.

281
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:53,831
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,

282
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:58,711
that you can give it to others suggesting
your love in it.

283
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:02,747
I think that’s the only thing the matter can do.

284
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:09,082
And in a very special way you can express that love.

285
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:13,416
For example, somebody likes a particular thing

286
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:16,133
you go all the way to get it

287
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:21,502
and give that small thing, very small thing,

288
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:26,491
to the person and the joy,

289
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,102
not out of the money that you have spent,

290
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:39,021
 but the feelings you have expressed
of knowing what that person would love.

291
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:45,720
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

292
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:54,804
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.

293
00:37:55,907 --> 00:38:00,622
And you don’t need anything because everybody is looking after your needs.

294
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:06,312
Now I have told them I love flowers because I don’t take anything else.

295
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:10,792
So you must see whenever I come My house is so filled with flowers that My husband was

296
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:14,372
saying, “Let us go live in the garden and let the flowers be here.”

297
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:24,762
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this center.

298
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:35,382
And whatever you eat, whatever you have to eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

299
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:40,811
You don’t have to bother as to what to eat, what not to eat – you just eat whatever

300
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,082
is good for you, benevolent for you.

301
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:48,692
You become so wise and also you please others.

302
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:53,342
You don’t displease others by saying, “This is bad food, I want that.”

303
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:55,402
’I want’ goes away.

304
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:57,882
What do you want?

305
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,602
[speaks aside]

306
00:39:00,722 --> 00:39:10,541
So the, like you could say a candle which is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

307
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:14,872
is asking for the light – “I want light.”

308
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:22,162
But once it is enlightened, it gives light to others, automatically - supposed to be.

309
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:31,002
In the same way you also start giving your light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.

310
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:33,632
I don’t have to tell you.

311
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:37,751
Nobody has to go through any Ten Commandments anymore.

312
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,742
Those days are gone.

313
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:55,182
Now automatically you become like that - very beautiful people, very affectionate and glorious,

314
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:56,182
I should say.

315
00:39:56,302 --> 00:40:03,761
If you see the glow on the face of Sahaja Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

316
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:13,952
Many people drop out their ten years to twenty years in their age and they are so enthusiastic,

317
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:21,691
never get tired, especially in England I’ve seen – or also in the West I would say everywhere

318
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:23,572
– people get very really tired.

319
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:27,082
On the television also you find people will come and sit down “huh…”

320
00:40:27,202 --> 00:40:34,932
Young people, they’ll talk ten times, they’ll say “huh…

321
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:39,302
Why are we so tired?”

322
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:41,551
Because we think too much.

323
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:48,182
All energy is wasted in thinking, so no energy left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

324
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:55,652
For example, you have to have people for dinner, they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

325
00:40:55,772 --> 00:41:01,192
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated and so nervous about the whole thing – when

326
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:05,532
the guests come in, they feel like running away.

327
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:09,521
Because so much of tension of thinking, thinking, thinking…..

328
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:13,352
Planning, planning, planning, planning, planning…

329
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,481
Ultimately the whole joy has disappeared.

330
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:28,362
So the second center which is there, it does a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

331
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:35,012
grey cells in our brain, when we are using it for thinking, and also it looks after your

332
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:46,162
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys and lower part of your abdomen.

333
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:52,462
Instead of doing that, poor thing is busy only sending grey cells to your brain because

334
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:56,262
thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad.

335
00:41:56,382 --> 00:42:02,362
So you develop all other diseases – liver trouble, which is very common.

336
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:06,642
Then you develop diabetes – very common.

337
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:14,612
Yesterday at least there were ten people who said we have diabetes.

338
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:19,271
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking too much sugar – take it from Me.

339
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:26,342
In India if you go to a village, you’ll see that he takes sugar in such a manner that

340
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:31,791
in the cup the spoon must stand at right angles, otherwise he won’t take it.

341
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:34,412
But he never gets diabetes.

342
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:41,282
The reason is he doesn’t think of tomorrow - he just works hard, eats his food and sleeps

343
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:42,422
off, nicely.

344
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,822
He doesn’t take sleeping pills either.

345
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:53,791
So this diabetes comes by over-thinking and can be easily cured if you can take to Sahaja

346
00:42:53,911 --> 00:43:00,501
Yoga, which I’ll tell you how we’ll stop our thinking at this, I’ve already told

347
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,021
you, at this point.

348
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:08,092
Then the third disease which is even more dangerous than this, is the disease which

349
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:12,522
we call as blood cancer.

350
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,981
Blood cancer is caused only to people who think too much.

351
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:22,422
It can even be to the children if the mother is very meticulous, particular about her carpets

352
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:26,781
or her house, everything you know and even a rat doesn’t enter that house.

353
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:32,122
But she is very careful that all her things are properly done, her sink doesn’t have

354
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:37,442
even so much of, little bit of a spot left in it.

355
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:43,802
All the time, thinking, planning, thinking, planning.

356
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:48,073
This affects the child and a child also can get blood cancer.

357
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:57,422
Blood cancer you get it because your spleen is a speedometer- is the one which gives you

358
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:00,922
the rhythm of life, rhythm of life.

359
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:11,872
Now when we are hectic people, all the time under shock, then this goes out of order.

360
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:22,582
For example in the morning we get up and see the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

361
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:26,992
have killed someone – such a shock.

362
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:29,382
Then an accident, then…

363
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:31,692
I mean newspaper will never give good news, will they?

364
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:39,542
Will they give news, how many people got realization or something is working out all, all right?

365
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:45,762
No something horrible that should shock your heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise

366
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:49,672
you’ll not take it seriously.

367
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:56,502
So, once you read that, you don’t know your system is a very delicate system, it gets

368
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:57,742
a shock.

369
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:01,852
And then you get into your car, without taking your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

370
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:03,972
breakfast because you are late.

371
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:09,152
On the way there is a jam – you are shouting, screaming - somehow or other you reach the

372
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:15,482
office and there is the boss barking.

373
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:18,892
This is how we live, under complete tension.

374
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:22,772
We are supposed to be free people.

375
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:30,272
In the night if you sing loudly the neighbor will come and put you to the police station.

376
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:33,392
I mean you can’t do anything.

377
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:35,272
There’s no freedom.

378
00:45:35,392 --> 00:45:38,002
You have to be bound by the watch.

379
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:42,592
This is the time, exact you have to reach there.

380
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:49,372
So all these things, pressures, and all these things work on us and we become hectic.

381
00:45:49,492 --> 00:46:00,302
And for emergency, this spleen is the one which releases red blood corpuscles – RBCs.

382
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:05,802
But if you are all the time like this hectic, that poor spleen becomes mad.

383
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:09,722
It doesn’t know what to do.

384
00:46:09,842 --> 00:46:16,352
It starts producing more cells, more cells and then it thinks it’s a mad person I am

385
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:20,462
fixed with because I don’t know when to act, when not to act.

386
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:25,132
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly with some other shock, you might get blood

387
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:30,812
cancer and then the doctors will certify you are going to die after one month.

388
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:34,162
Finished, prepare for your burial.

389
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:38,172
And the whole house is crying.

390
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:52,452
But we have cured, I mean Sahaja Yoga has cured blood cancer of many people just by

391
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:59,872
this Kundalini awakening because as soon as the Kundalini is awakened, too much movement

392
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:05,062
this side and that side, this all the time going on, in the center – this is the left

393
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:09,922
and the right side of the sympathetic – so just the Kundalini passes through, strings

394
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:17,602
through and brings it back and nourishes it.

395
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:19,682
The problem is over.

396
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:26,982
And though they were certified to be dead, after even four years they are all right,

397
00:47:27,102 --> 00:47:35,862
working all right, the certificate is cancelled.

398
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:44,222
Even vulnerability to cancer, or to all incurable diseases, are because of these centers going

399
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:50,432
out of place.

400
00:47:50,552 --> 00:47:57,752
Now we have the center which we call here as the heart center.

401
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:04,732
It controls the left and right, both – so we have a left and right heart in Sahaja Yoga.

402
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:17,142
As you know that, this sternum bone creates the antibodies for you.

403
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:22,622
And these antibodies fight your diseases.

404
00:48:22,742 --> 00:48:33,233
So when this center goes out, this is the center which sends all the messages to these

405
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:36,762
antibodies.

406
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:41,532
Now this is the center of a mother.

407
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:48,181
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop breast cancer.

408
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:56,752
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

409
00:48:56,872 --> 00:49:08,222
her motherhood is challenged and her sense of security is very disturbed.

410
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:16,072
As a result of that, she gets this problem.

411
00:49:16,192 --> 00:49:23,282
Also if you are too much of a thinker, and you think too much and you’re very, what

412
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:29,442
we call the right-sided, the futuristic planner, I mean people plan it for ten years.

413
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:34,972
They plan even their deaths, what dress they are going to wear and where they are going

414
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:40,202
to be buried, up to that point.

415
00:49:40,322 --> 00:49:49,322
All this futuristic planning creates such tremendous heat in the body because the liver,

416
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:55,662
which is supposed to absorb all the heat, is neglected by this center.

417
00:49:55,782 --> 00:50:01,072
As a result that heat travels up and you develop asthma.

418
00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:08,032
Now we had yesterday, at least five or six people who came with asthma.

419
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:11,702
Asthma is absolutely curable.

420
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:15,922
But do you know this is the center of a husband, or of the father.

421
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:20,862
Now if I am telling you, you should not be shocked, because later on you’ll find it.

422
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:25,392
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get asthma.

423
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:30,692
Or if your wife is a shrew, you might get an asthma.

424
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:36,292
Or if you are a very bad father, you might get an asthma.

425
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:42,492
Or if your father is not kind to you, you might get an asthma.

426
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:47,812
If you have not forgiven your father, you might get asthma.

427
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:54,532
Now can you believe it, just forgiving your father, you can get out of your asthma permanently.

428
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:58,002
Sahaja Yoga has cured asthma of so many people.

429
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:02,602
Believe it or not, it works.

430
00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:11,922
It looks so funny but our relationships, our parents we have chosen when we came on this

431
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:12,922
Earth.

432
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:19,312
I know they are wrong, they are obstinate, they’re headstrong, they may be drunkards,

433
00:51:19,432 --> 00:51:20,782
whatever they are.

434
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:25,782
But even if you leave them, because so many people leave the parents, still forgive them

435
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:26,782
and forget.

436
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,162
Otherwise you carry the problems with you.

437
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:37,632
The left heart is the place of the mother.

438
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:42,352
Now if your mother has been hard with you, if you have had very bad experiences, you

439
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:47,182
will have problems of the left heart.

440
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:51,492
Center heart is very important where your sense of security should be established.

441
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:56,782
You’ll be surprised in the disease called AIDS, it is the center heart which is out.

442
00:51:56,902 --> 00:52:04,252
We have tried to cure, and we cured also 3, 4 people from AIDS, but they have no will-power

443
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:07,602
to continue with Sahaja Yoga, they want to die.

444
00:52:07,722 --> 00:52:13,452
And they have made a big martyrdom out of it, you see they are martyrs, great martyrs

445
00:52:13,572 --> 00:52:16,242
of a great principle they have established.

446
00:52:16,362 --> 00:52:22,582
It’s impossible to convince to them, that this is unnatural that you are doing and that

447
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:25,472
you should give it up and you should live, why should you die?

448
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:30,922
No, we are martyrs for such a big principle we have established.

449
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:36,652
To do something out of the way and new is the modern fashion.

450
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:44,002
Anything - will do something with the hair, with the nose, with the eyes, with the ears,

451
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,312
with the clothes.

452
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:47,501
That’s all you can do.

453
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:56,732
To such an extent that they do not realize that whatever is new may not be good for you.

454
00:52:56,852 --> 00:52:58,872
For example, everyday we eat our dinner.

455
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:05,702
Supposing we want to eat the table because it is new – is it a sensible thing?

456
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:09,212
Anything that is new, is not good.

457
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:12,292
But anything that is old, may not be good also.

458
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:17,982
So you have to have that wisdom which comes to you through Sahaja Yoga.

459
00:53:18,102 --> 00:53:24,332
There is no other way out - you have to become the spirit, and you have to see in the light

460
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:27,312
of the spirit, what is right and what is wrong.

461
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:35,792
So then wecome to this center which is, we call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

462
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,932
petals, looks after the cervical plexus.

463
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:43,732
Now this is a very very important center and this is the center is for communication.

464
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:48,582
For example, when you talk, you communicate through your hands.

465
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:52,632
You shake hands, you touch somebody, and you can communicate.

466
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:56,482
Even if you cannot talk, with your hands you can communicate.

467
00:53:56,602 --> 00:54:06,522
Also when we think we are very responsible, this center goes out.

468
00:54:06,642 --> 00:54:12,922
Like some people were traveling by plane - they were from villages, they did not know what

469
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,192
was a plane.

470
00:54:14,312 --> 00:54:21,452
They were told to take less luggage because it should not be a weight for the plane.

471
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:24,262
So they got into the plane and put all of the luggage on their heads.

472
00:54:24,382 --> 00:54:31,132
And they said that “We are trying to reduce the weight of the plane.”

473
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:38,762
In the same way, we are also... actually the One - which is all-pervading power, which

474
00:54:38,882 --> 00:54:43,092
has created us, created this universe and has brought us to this level of human beings

475
00:54:43,212 --> 00:54:44,532
- is doing everything.

476
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:49,692
But we think we are responsible, we have to do it.

477
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:54,212
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you just do it, no doubt.

478
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,512
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

479
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:59,342
You just say its happening.

480
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,382
And what a beautiful feeling it is.

481
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:08,912
Then you don’t have blood pressures, you don’t have headaches, you don’t have tensions

482
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:11,642
– no, because we are not doing it.

483
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:18,972
It is just done and you find it’s all done.

484
00:55:19,092 --> 00:55:27,182
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

485
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:28,312
you can control.

486
00:55:28,432 --> 00:55:31,952
If you want you can think or you don’t think.

487
00:55:32,072 --> 00:55:35,532
But in that silence you feel your peace.

488
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:44,092
If there’s too much of crowds, too much of problems, suddenly you become the witness.

489
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:46,602
You start seeing everything.

490
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:50,742
Seeing the problem, what it is.

491
00:55:50,862 --> 00:55:55,252
Unless and until you can see the problem you cannot solve it.

492
00:55:55,372 --> 00:55:58,072
Because you are in the problem, you just get upset.

493
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:01,972
But if you are out of the problem, you can see it.

494
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:08,402
And that’s what happens to you when you become thoughtlessly aware when this center

495
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:10,022
opens out.

496
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:18,002
Last but not the least is the center of limbic area which is very important.

497
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:22,752
Now I do not know it has been discovered or not, but it will be very soon discovered,

498
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:31,262
that very strong things like cracks and all that have got sulfuric acid in it, and that

499
00:56:31,382 --> 00:56:36,672
doesn’t go anywhere in the body, just rushes into the limbic area.

500
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:44,092
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which has got all cells here very sensitive to joy

501
00:56:44,212 --> 00:56:45,282
and happiness.

502
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:53,342
But they become numb, so numb that ordinary music you cannot hear - somebody has to scream

503
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:58,472
at you, has to shout at you, he has to jump on it, otherwise you cannot enjoy.

504
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:04,302
Then it has to be worse and worse and worse and worse…

505
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:09,942
I don’t know now with cracks, later on they might develop something even more poisonous,

506
00:57:10,062 --> 00:57:16,832
because it has to excite this limbic area which is such an important thing.

507
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:26,542
But as soon as the Kundalini enters into that area, limbic area, she soothes it and it opens

508
00:57:26,662 --> 00:57:33,562
- opens like a lotus, thousand petalled lotus.

509
00:57:33,682 --> 00:57:43,812
It opens and then the Kundalini emerges out of your fontanelle bone area and gets connected

510
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:45,532
to the all-pervading power.

511
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:49,232
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands.

512
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:51,832
You can feel it all over.

513
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:56,742
Some people in the beginning who felt cool breeze, could not believe it – so they closed

514
00:57:56,862 --> 00:58:01,332
doors, everything and sat down to see, still they were feeling it.

515
00:58:01,452 --> 00:58:08,812
But it works, works in the sense that you get empowered.

516
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:16,322
You become peaceful, you become the witness, you become the wise and you become empowered

517
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:23,072
that you can give realizations to others like this, that you can raise the Kundalini like

518
00:58:23,192 --> 00:58:26,322
this and you can establish that connection.

519
00:58:26,442 --> 00:58:29,162
You can do it.

520
00:58:29,282 --> 00:58:33,102
And this is what is your right to have it.

521
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,202
This is what will give you meaning.

522
00:58:35,322 --> 00:58:42,482
Otherwise so far whatever we have been doing is very frustrating.

523
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:47,932
Now yesterday I said some questions can be asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

524
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:51,462
That means you have no questions?

525
00:58:51,582 --> 00:59:26,822
Or there are some questions we can deal with it for about 5 minutes.

526
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:33,992
There’s one there, please..

527
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:55,502
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi near Mother?) repeats the question:

528
00:59:55,622 --> 01:00:00,302
[What is the process by which you one stops thinking?]

529
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:02,572
It’s very simple.

530
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:10,562
When the Kundalini settles down there, what happens, as I told you, there is Christ – Christ

531
01:00:10,682 --> 01:00:18,722
is awakened and He sucks in these two institutions which you see there, the yellow and the blue.

532
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:25,632
These are – one is, the blue one is our conditioning and the yellow one is our ego.

533
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:29,422
So both these are sucked in like that.

534
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:37,342
These are sucked in because it is said that He died for our sins, didn’t He?

535
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:38,342
He suffered for us.

536
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:43,312
Now also that’s why yesterday I’ve said are we going to suffer more than Him?

537
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,602
We don’t have to suffer.

538
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:48,062
Only awaken Him at Agnya.

539
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:52,152
We are all right, this is the process, it opens out.

540
01:00:52,272 --> 01:00:54,172
All right?

541
01:00:54,292 --> 01:01:01,652
That’s why I said you must forgive, because He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

542
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:05,372
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why we do both the things – one in the front

543
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:11,262
and one in the back.

544
01:01:11,382 --> 01:01:12,552
Please get up.

545
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:18,362
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

546
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,363
Automatically, I’ll tell you how.

547
01:01:21,483 --> 01:01:25,092
Please, you see like if you have to sprout a seed you have to just put it in the Mother

548
01:01:25,212 --> 01:01:26,092
Earth.

549
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:27,092
How do you do it?

550
01:01:27,212 --> 01:01:33,652
The Mother Earth has got the capacity and the seed is built-in within it.

551
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:36,772
Now it is all built-in within you, all right.

552
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:42,602
And just you are here, I can raise it – anybody can raise it, those who have got the capacity

553
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:46,722
– Sahaja Yogis can raise your Kundalini also.

554
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:51,942
[Question from the floor, : You talk about always thinking.

555
01:01:52,062 --> 01:02:01,872
You talk about, like, if you think too much, you can actually create illness and the problems

556
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:05,492
in your life.

557
01:02:05,612 --> 01:02:11,832
How do You organize Your time and Your work and everything, but You don’t think about

558
01:02:11,952 --> 01:02:12,832
it?]

559
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:15,822
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.

560
01:02:15,942 --> 01:02:17,122
Everything is done by Divine Power.

561
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:28,522
Why should I think – let it think for Me.

562
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:33,862
You see I travel every day – I sleep at 2 o’clock in the night, get up about 5 o’clock

563
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:38,412
in the morning and I travel everywhere.

564
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:43,472
And I’m now 67 years of age, all right, so what.

565
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:46,572
Divine Power is looking after Me, it’s working out everything.

566
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:56,062
I am just moving about nicely enjoying everything.

567
01:02:56,182 --> 01:03:07,272
But you have to believe that you can get realization.

568
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:11,832
You need not believe in the Divine Power, but you just first believe that you can get

569
01:03:11,952 --> 01:03:15,602
realization and you get it and get in connection with it.

570
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:16,862
It just works.

571
01:03:16,982 --> 01:03:18,882
It is the subtlest of subtle.

572
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:28,602
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we utilize the divine power in our relationships

573
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,382
and all the problems?]

574
01:03:31,502 --> 01:03:37,052
You see first of all you have to give to others.

575
01:03:37,172 --> 01:03:42,402
Unless and until you open one door, all right that’s Divine Power there.

576
01:03:42,522 --> 01:03:46,542
But unless and until you open other door, it won’t come in your life.

577
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,162
So you have to open the other door also.

578
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:55,352
There’s where we fail, we want to use Sahaja Yoga for our own purpose, for our own – my

579
01:03:55,472 --> 01:04:02,542
brother, my sister, my son, all sorts of my, my, my…

580
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:07,122
There there’s problem – but open it out.

581
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:09,092
Everything works out.

582
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:15,272
You must learn to give.

583
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:19,012
This is free.

584
01:04:19,132 --> 01:04:26,222
[Question inaudible]

585
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:31,232
It is situated on top of the brain where it is above the brain, and it is covered with,

586
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:41,192
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because I don’t want to quarrel with them.

587
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:44,892
But there are 1000 nerves which cover it.

588
01:04:45,012 --> 01:04:52,792
And when it is enlightened you’ll be surprised, you’ll see a beautiful lotus opening in

589
01:04:52,912 --> 01:05:08,612
all colors, very very silent flames, and they are so peace-giving, looks so beautiful.

590
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:17,752
Because when any nerve gets enlightened, the light of that flame looks like a petal.

591
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,612
It’s very beautiful, it is.

592
01:05:20,732 --> 01:05:22,882
But it has to open out.

593
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:26,382
Just now it is covered by our conditioning and our ego.

594
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:29,991
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

595
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:35,052
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

596
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:45,872
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

597
01:05:45,992 --> 01:06:21,992
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human being and a realized soul.

598
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:59,572
These are the two stages.

599

01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:11,212
homeless, they are on the streets.

602
01:07:11,332 --> 01:07:16,822
Now thinking about it you are not going to help them, are you?

603
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:17,822
No.

604
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:22,212
Which is the best way is to empower yourself, all right?

605
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:31,932
Now see for example, in the villages of India where I work, people have given them alcohol,

606
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:38,122
they have given up all bad habits, they have become very dynamic, they have become very

607
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:41,372
well off, they are living very well.

608
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:50,122
In London, if you want to work, I am sure you can get a home, no problem.

609
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:54,732
You see the Asians who have come here, I am an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

610
01:07:54,852 --> 01:08:02,172
they are becoming very rich, because they work very hard, very hard, so those who want

611
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:03,172
to… in London.

612
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,192
But in India it may not be.

613
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:09,852
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have improved so much – they have become so dynamic,

614
01:08:09,972 --> 01:08:13,272
they have become so hopeful of life.

615
01:08:13,392 --> 01:08:21,032
But if you just think that life is good for nothing, let us now drink and be merry then

616
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:23,242
it won’t work out.

617
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:28,082
These homeless and all these conditions are all such – because it is an artificial condition

618
01:08:28,202 --> 01:08:35,232
you know, many people have houses but they don’t want to give it for people to live.

619
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:41,422
Now if those people get transformation, they won’t behave like that.

620
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:46,672
You see the whole behavior will change when the emancipation of the society comes up.

621
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:54,182
But I have seen in the villages of India there’s a complete transformation.

622
01:08:54,302 --> 01:09:00,222
The social conditions are much worse but Indians are more satisfied people, they are not so

623
01:09:00,342 --> 01:09:01,222
much.

624
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:07,182
Here even, supposing you offer a house, they will say, “No, I don’t like this house.”

625
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:09,812
You offer a job, they’ll say, “I don’t want this job.”

626
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:14,162
All these things are there – also too much of choices.

627
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:19,922
But if you decide, London is not difficult place I tell you to work hard and get a house,

628
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:22,262
not difficult, they can do it.

629
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:27,572
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

630
01:09:27,692 --> 01:09:32,472
There are so many old people who haven’t got anybody to help them.

631
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:35,902
But these people will never go and help them.

632
01:09:36,022 --> 01:09:37,212
They can earn.

633
01:09:37,332 --> 01:09:42,432
This is a place where anybody can earn I think, because I know people, Asians, who have come

634
01:09:42,552 --> 01:09:48,751
here without any money are very rich today - all have got big big cars, nice houses,

635
01:09:48,871 --> 01:09:49,751
this, that.

636
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:52,112
You can see that they are very hardworking.

637
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:57,852
And then divorces, everybody third day if you divorce someone what will happen to you?

638
01:09:57,972 --> 01:09:59,942
You’ll end up without a home.

639
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:04,042
No respect for the wife, the wife has no respect for the house.

640
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,262
All upside down society.

641
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:12,232
There’s a big quarrel going on between husband and wife – how can you have a home with

642
01:10:12,352 --> 01:10:14,062
this husband and wife fighting?

643
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:18,872
Even TV if you open, nothing but fighting - you just don’t want to hear anyone.

644
01:10:18,992 --> 01:10:25,802
See we had to decide on certain things – that if we have to make a home, then we have to

645
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,802
understand our role in life.

646
01:10:27,922 --> 01:10:34,322
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal, no doubt.

647
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:41,802
But they are like two wheels of a chariot which has some distance but they are not similar.

648
01:10:41,922 --> 01:10:46,102
And no use fighting with each other – when you can’t live without each other, why should

649
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:47,102
you fight?

650
01:10:47,222 --> 01:10:49,232
And the children are on the streets.

651
01:10:49,352 --> 01:10:54,602
Every child I find 18 years of age is out of the house.

652
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:58,001
I mean here the little children are killed – why?

653
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:02,152
In India, I cannot think of such a thing.

654
01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:11,152
The reason, though they are very poor, the reason is they know what is love.

655
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:16,491
And that is what I feel that the society has to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

656
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:22,382
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga – I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%.

657
01:11:22,502 --> 01:11:26,632
They have beautiful children, they are living very well, they have good houses.

658
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:32,172
Those who were really hippies had nothing, are having nice houses and everything they

659
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:33,842
have.

660
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:41,512
Also some of them, were “Oh, so I am now fortunately, I am without job.”

661
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,692
And I said, “What, you are very fortunate?”

662
01:11:44,812 --> 01:11:47,001
“Yea, now I am without job.

663
01:11:47,121 --> 01:11:49,491
Very happy about it.”

664
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:55,501
So I told the gentleman that if you are not going to stick to one job, you are not going

665
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:58,672
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

666
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:07,652
And that fellow today has a big car, a nice wife, children and a house.

667
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:16,482
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must be given up.

668
01:12:16,602 --> 01:12:19,972
One has to come to a balance and value your life.

669
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:24,402
You must value it.

670
01:12:24,522 --> 01:12:26,112
Human life is very valuable.

671
01:12:26,232 --> 01:12:42,842
With what great difficulty God has created you and what are we doing with it?

672
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:51,722
The whole society has to take a turn and think of living happily – if the husband and wife,

673
01:12:51,842 --> 01:13:00,602
I mean such a relationship, husband and wife cannot live together, then how do we expect

674
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:03,122
this world to have United Nations?

675
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:06,802
We cannot – it is falsehood.

676
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:20,832
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

677
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:25,952
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand – fallen in love, now they are rising in

678
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:29,751
love, falling in love again, again falling, rising in love again… how many times they

679
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:31,482
fall in love God only knows.

680
01:13:31,602 --> 01:13:36,012
It’s a funny stuff going on.

681
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:42,232
We have to face the reality.

682
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:47,251
So just worrying about these things, what we should do, is to first of all become wise

683
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,062
and understand the problems.

684
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:52,832
We can all solve it.

685
01:13:52,952 --> 01:13:57,712
It is very simple, it is very simple to solve the problems.

686
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:03,052
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

687
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:09,972
And secondly, that it solves your problems.

688
01:14:10,092 --> 01:14:15,481
Just worrying about poor people, it’s also a kind of a fashion these days.

689
01:14:15,601 --> 01:14:18,372
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met a lady.

690
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,352
She said, “I am very guilty.”

691
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:21,352
I said, “Why?”

692
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:22,352
“Because of Afghanistan.”

693
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:23,352
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

694
01:14:23,472 --> 01:14:26,042
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

695
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:30,382
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

696
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:31,382
“Nothing.”

697
01:14:31,502 --> 01:14:36,022
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing about it?

698
01:14:36,142 --> 01:14:51,012
But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi finds out ways and methods of creating a convenient

699
01:14:51,132 --> 01:14:56,802
life – a life where you can earn, you can live… we do it – we have done, I have

700
01:14:56,922 --> 01:15:03,402
so many examples.

701
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:06,592
Because it’s a collective life also you help each other.

702
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:13,322
We didn’t have rich people in Sahaja Yoga many because they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga.

703
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:18,182
They go to false gurus because they can purchase the guru – they can’t purchase Me.

704
01:15:18,302 --> 01:15:22,052
So mostly the rich never come here.

705
01:15:22,172 --> 01:15:26,022
Bureaucrats also don’t come, politicians don’t come.

706
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:32,372
So those people who come to Me are the people who can easily solve the problem because they

707
01:15:32,492 --> 01:15:40,692
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

708
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:49,812
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My husband was not so for it – everybody said,

709
01:15:49,932 --> 01:15:52,002
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”

710
01:15:52,122 --> 01:16:00,842
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey, and a woman, I just said I must go.

711
01:16:00,962 --> 01:16:05,414
But I was surprised, they worshipped Mother, they worshipped their mothers.

712
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:09,532
And they were so beautiful – so many.

713
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:15,132
In one shot, we got 70 people – serious Sahaja Yogis.

714
01:16:15,252 --> 01:16:20,882
But do you know when I reached there, people from America, from Australia, from all over

715
01:16:21,002 --> 01:16:25,552
the world arrived there in Turkey to help Me.

716
01:16:25,672 --> 01:16:31,802
I mean I was so enamored to see My children coming, arriving there on their own - those

717
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,022
who could afford it.

718
01:16:34,142 --> 01:16:37,842
And the Turkish people were so beautiful, I tell you.

719
01:16:37,962 --> 01:16:41,882
I found they are the same everywhere.

720
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:50,632
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell you, otherwise we are just the same.

721
01:16:50,752 --> 01:17:04,882
So all these problems can be easily solved – there’s nothing so serious about it.

722
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:33,532
There is

723
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:49,152
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and until you are connected, it is like telephoning

724
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:52,232
without connection.

725
01:17:52,352 --> 01:18:00,922
There are people in India who’ll go on saying “Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama” like that.

726
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:04,741
And the chakra of Rama itself will be caught.

727
01:18:04,861 --> 01:18:10,342
They’ll be saying “Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva” and the heart chakra, where Shiva resides,

728
01:18:10,462 --> 01:18:12,431
it will be caught.

729
01:18:12,551 --> 01:18:22,842
The reason is, supposing you want to meet the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

730
01:18:22,962 --> 01:18:28,012
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested!

731
01:18:28,132 --> 01:18:38,282
And you’ll end up in a jail!

732
01:18:38,402 --> 01:18:48,362
So you must have some connection, there should be some protocol.

733
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:54,812
Now if it is for kings and prime ministers, what about God?

734
01:18:54,932 --> 01:18:59,742
He’s not in your pocket.

735
01:18:59,862 --> 01:19:03,112
But once you are realized, even once you take the name, it is sufficient.

736
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:04,672
What is there?

737
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:07,912
He’s at your disposal all the time there.

738
01:19:08,032 --> 01:19:10,652
But you have to have connection.

739
01:19:10,772 --> 01:19:16,612
Now you are the citizens say of England, or some place, all right so your government is

740
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:17,702
looking after you.

741
01:19:17,822 --> 01:19:20,982
Whether you are satisfied or not is not the point.

742
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:22,932
But they are looking after you.

743
01:19:23,052 --> 01:19:30,552
But if you enter into the Kingdom of God, then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.

744
01:19:30,672 --> 01:19:38,382
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things work out.

745
01:19:38,502 --> 01:20:14,802
So amazing

746
01:20:14,922 --> 01:20:20,392
it is, so amazing.

747
01:20:20,512 --> 01:20:26,072
See first of all they say Kundalini has to rise.

748
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:33,342
Then it sometimes comes back to the centers which are needing more help.

749
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:41,342
So it is like a rope you can say, which has many strings in it, very thin ones just like

750
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:46,662
a hair, and one by one they open out.

751
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:55,382
So first, very few of them pierce through, open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

752
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:58,002
and the chakras open out more.

753
01:20:58,122 --> 01:21:00,572
It goes on like that.

754
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:08,242
But once you are connected properly then there’s no problem.

755
01:21:08,362 --> 01:21:12,722
But it is instantaneous, no doubt about it.

756
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:19,242
But for that you have to come to our centers, don’t have to pay anything, just spend some

757
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:25,832
time and you have to master it, that’s all.

758
01:21:25,952 --> 01:21:34,352
There’s a question, what purpose do we have on this planet?

759
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:48,672
The purpose of our existence is to prove that God’s creation is the most successful thing.

760
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:53,202
That’s the purpose.

761
01:21:53,322 --> 01:22:14,851
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry.

762
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:19,902
You better get your realization and try to find out about Me, because those who have

763
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:23,871
talked - you see human beings are mad people, you don’t know.

764
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:28,632
Christ said “I am the Son of God” – which He was no doubt.

765
01:22:28,752 --> 01:22:33,802
And He saidthat, “I am the door” – which He was, no doubt.

766
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:35,012
But they crucified Him.

767
01:22:35,132 --> 01:22:38,232
They gave poison to Mohammed Sahib.

768
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,532
They killed so many saints.

769
01:22:40,652 --> 01:22:45,742
I know human beings very well, so please I am not going to talk to you about Myself at

770
01:22:45,862 --> 01:22:46,802
all.

771
01:22:46,922 --> 01:22:52,121
You better get your self-realization - try to know Me.

772
01:22:52,241 --> 01:23:00,622
Because I have to do some jobs, all right and for that, I want to live.

773
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,132
People are really sometimes so funny.

774
01:23:04,252 --> 01:23:09,762
Even otherwise they behave in such a funny manner that I can’t understand.

775
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:14,342
As if I am going to take away their property or something.

776
01:23:14,462 --> 01:23:21,342
I am here to give you something that is very important.

777
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:41,822
Sort of you can say I am here to complete the work of Christ, Mohammed and all of them.

778
01:23:41,942 --> 01:23:58,712
Yes please….

779
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:09,932
When you will give to others, you will receive the blessings.

780
01:24:10,052 --> 01:24:13,492
That’s what it is absolutely 100%.

781
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:16,492
He said so many things.

782
01:24:16,612 --> 01:24:23,952
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout I think.

783
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:34,742
[Question inaudible]

784
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:48,702
That

785
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:51,812
should not be the question just now, all right.

786
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:55,822
Because to say anything about it, you know what happens with people.

787
01:24:55,942 --> 01:25:02,952
So this can be discussed later on, when we get our self-realization.

788
01:25:03,072 --> 01:25:10,292
Certain things at a level can be discussed and this is what happened with all of them

789
01:25:10,412 --> 01:25:16,032
because they had very little time to talk to you.

790
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:26,922
And that’s why everything has been misinterpreted, misused, because to understand the truth,

791
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:32,842
to bear it also, one has to have self-realization.

792
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,582
This I have found out.

793
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:40,592
If you are not a self realized person you can’t bear the truth, you cannot – it’s

794
01:25:40,712 --> 01:25:53,662
too much for human mind to grasp and to allow it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.

795
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:56,982
Truth is too much for them.

796
01:25:57,102 --> 01:26:00,702
So the first thing should be that we get our self-realization.

797
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,502
Yes, my child…

798
01:26:02,622 --> 01:26:04,302
[Initial question inaudible.

799
01:26:04,422 --> 01:26:09,942
Mother: Can you get up, please?

800
01:26:10,062 --> 01:26:16,472
Questioner: Yes, of course

801
01:26:16,592 --> 01:26:21,371
Mother: Thank you.

802
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:34,062
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change all the time?[…

803
01:26:34,182 --> 01:26:35,632
INAUDIBLE]

804
01:26:35,752 --> 01:26:39,862
But the auras you see sometimes are these colors only.

805
01:26:39,982 --> 01:26:44,132
But sometimes you are more strong with one center, so that color shows.

806
01:26:44,252 --> 01:26:51,121
They do not change, they are just the same.

807
01:26:51,241 --> 01:26:55,822
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

808
01:26:55,942 --> 01:27:02,502
us finish with our self-realization which is going to take only 10 minutes.

809
01:27:02,622 --> 01:27:08,462
Those who do not want to have should please leave, they should not sit here and just watch

810
01:27:08,582 --> 01:27:09,562
other people.

811
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:16,042
That’s the only kindness I request of them – that if you do not want to have self-realization,

812
01:27:16,162 --> 01:27:19,492
it’s better that you should leave.

813
01:27:19,612 --> 01:27:25,002
Those people who are standing, could not get place, can come here or you can also give

814
01:27:25,122 --> 01:27:29,112
them places if you want to give some places.

815
01:27:29,232 --> 01:27:34,342
No, not for Sahaja Yogis, I said for others – for others, for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis

816
01:27:34,462 --> 01:27:35,502
can stand up.

817
01:27:35,622 --> 01:28:18,622
At the very outset you have to now understand that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

818
01:28:18,742 --> 01:28:29,271
of God and hence we have to little bit unload ourselves.

819
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:42,532
One of the conditions is that we should not feel guilty – one should not feel guilty

820
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:43,532
at all.

821
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:47,082
Yesterday, same problem I said, but you were still feeling guilty.

822
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,632
Also it’s a fashion.

823
01:28:48,752 --> 01:28:53,082
Also I think the language is such – all the time sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry…

824
01:28:53,202 --> 01:28:57,922
Even when we used to receive telephones we used to say “I beg your pardon.”

825
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:00,582
But now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten times sorry.

826
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:05,882
What is there to be so sorry?

827
01:29:06,002 --> 01:29:08,802
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

828
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:10,592
We have to respect ourselves.

829
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:13,672
We have to be happy about ourselves.

830
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:21,402
This is first thing is not to feel guilty about anything - just believe that you have

831
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:28,532
done nothing wrong which cannot be dissolved by this great power of forgiveness.

832
01:29:28,652 --> 01:29:32,122
Please believe Me.

833
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:38,322
But if you want to stick onto a feeling like that – “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s

834
01:29:38,442 --> 01:29:39,472
only mental.

835
01:29:39,592 --> 01:29:46,972
Animals don’t feel guilty about anything – a dog will bark, tiger will eat anything

836
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:48,592
that it wants to.

837
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:52,972
It’s only human beings who feel that way – that I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done

838
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:53,972
that wrong.

839
01:29:54,092 --> 01:29:59,282
All right, so not to feel guilty that’s one point.

840
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:10,802
The second one is to forgive everyone, which is very difficult for many people.

841
01:30:10,922 --> 01:30:18,052
I don’t know how many mounds of unhappiness is in the head because we cannot forgive.

842
01:30:18,172 --> 01:30:23,162
Mounds, it’s not kilos and kilos.

843
01:30:23,282 --> 01:30:31,932
Yesterday I found most of them had not forgiven and I had to go on putting balm on their heads

844
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:33,652
to take out.

845
01:30:33,772 --> 01:30:36,342
So you must cooperate.

846
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:40,922
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

847
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:44,932
First of all forgive yourself and forgive everyone.

848
01:30:45,052 --> 01:30:50,452
And be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

849
01:30:50,572 --> 01:30:53,592
There’s no Greek tragedy going on here – no tragedy.

850
01:30:53,712 --> 01:31:04,292
We are in a very beautiful atmosphere and we are going to go into the most beautiful

851
01:31:04,412 --> 01:31:08,182
area within ourselves, that is our spirit.

852
01:31:08,302 --> 01:31:13,402
So we have to be very light about it.

853
01:31:13,522 --> 01:31:22,712
All right, with all this understanding, I have to request you that we have to take out

854
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:30,081
your shoes because this Mother Earth also helps us a lot.

855
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:50,792
And not to be serious – not to be serious about it.

856
01:31:50,912 --> 01:32:04,612
It’s not frivolous, but it’s fun.

857
01:32:04,732 --> 01:32:22,882
So you have to put your left hand towards Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

858
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:29,572
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down it would be very nice.

859
01:32:29,692 --> 01:32:32,862
Please be seated and don’t move about.

860
01:32:32,982 --> 01:32:39,132
Left hand towards Me like that – be comfortable, if you want you can put it on your lap or

861
01:32:39,252 --> 01:32:41,112
you can put it up if you want to.

862
01:32:41,232 --> 01:32:54,092
Then the right hand needs to be used for nourishing your centers on the left-hand side.

863
01:32:54,212 --> 01:32:58,412
Now I’ll show you how we’ll be nourishing.

864
01:32:58,532 --> 01:33:02,972
Before that, please remember that put your both the feet apart from each other – not

865
01:33:03,092 --> 01:33:06,842
too much, but slightly.

866
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:12,962
Now, left hand towards Me.

867
01:33:13,082 --> 01:33:20,232
I’ll show you before and then we can close our eyes and work it out.

868
01:33:20,352 --> 01:33:33,072
Put your right hand on your heart – in the heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

869
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:41,302
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

870
01:33:41,422 --> 01:33:46,331
reflection of God Almighty.

871
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:54,152
So we put our attention to our heart first.

872
01:33:54,272 --> 01:34:02,132
Then we take our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side and press

873
01:34:02,252 --> 01:34:03,442
it hard.

874
01:34:03,562 --> 01:34:07,802
This is the center of our mastery.

875
01:34:07,922 --> 01:34:16,842
We take down our right hand on the lower portion of our abdomen and press it hard.

876
01:34:16,962 --> 01:34:28,362
This is the center of pure knowledge that manifests on our central nervous system.

877
01:34:28,482 --> 01:34:38,032
We take back our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

878
01:34:38,152 --> 01:34:46,932
And again we take it in the heart, in the upper portion of our heart.

879
01:34:47,052 --> 01:34:55,963
Then we take it in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and put your head to the

880
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:58,642
right.

881
01:34:58,762 --> 01:35:07,702
This is the center we catch when we feel guilty.

882
01:35:07,822 --> 01:35:22,362
Then we take our hand on our forehead and slowly bring down our head on it to rest.

883
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:33,472
Here we press it on both the sides and this is the center to forgive.

884
01:35:33,592 --> 01:35:47,282
We take back our hand on the back side of our head and put our head resting on it - this

885
01:35:47,402 --> 01:35:53,132
is the center for asking forgiveness without feeling guilty.

886
01:35:53,252 --> 01:36:03,402
We stretch our hand, with the center of our palm, we put it on our head in the soft bone

887
01:36:03,522 --> 01:36:12,172
area of our childhood, called as fontanelle bone area, and slowly we put down our head.

888
01:36:12,292 --> 01:36:27,302
Here we stretch our fingers and move our scalp carefully with pressure, slowly, clockwise,

889
01:36:27,422 --> 01:36:33,262
seven times.

890
01:36:33,382 --> 01:36:51,802
That’s all we have to do.

891
01:36:51,922 --> 01:37:00,442
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them until I ask you to open because attention

892
01:37:00,562 --> 01:37:02,202
has to go inside.

893
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:04,932
Put your left hand towards Me.

894
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:10,142
Now first you will feel thoughtless – so don’t fight with your thoughts.

895
01:37:10,262 --> 01:37:12,322
Automatically everything will work out.

896
01:37:12,442 --> 01:37:20,552
Don’t fight with your thoughts, just keep watching and ultimately you will feel cool

897
01:37:20,672 --> 01:37:25,562
breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area and you’ll also start feeling cool

898
01:37:25,682 --> 01:37:32,082
breeze all around you which is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze of the

899
01:37:32,202 --> 01:37:42,282
all-pervading power as described by Adi Shankaracharya, Salilam, salilam – it’s cool, and cool.

900
01:37:42,402 --> 01:37:55,302
So now, we put our left hand this way towards Me and the right hand on the heart.

901
01:37:55,422 --> 01:38:04,682
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, three times – “Mother, am I

902
01:38:04,802 --> 01:38:06,382
the Spirit?”

903
01:38:06,502 --> 01:38:15,382
In your heart, ask the question “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

904
01:38:15,502 --> 01:38:27,002
If you are the spirit you are your master, because in the light of your spirit you know

905
01:38:27,122 --> 01:38:31,612
what is right and what is wrong – you can guide yourself.

906
01:38:31,732 --> 01:38:38,392
So put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

907
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:49,182
here please ask Me a question again three times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

908
01:38:49,302 --> 01:38:58,682
“Mother, am I my own master?”

909
01:38:58,802 --> 01:39:09,642
As I have told you that I will not cross your freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

910
01:39:09,762 --> 01:39:19,522
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge on yourself, otherwise I cannot.

911
01:39:19,642 --> 01:39:27,442
So please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask the question,

912
01:39:27,562 --> 01:39:42,172
“Mother” - or you can request “Mother please give me pure knowledge.”

913
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:50,442
Say this six times because this center has got six petals.

914
01:39:50,562 --> 01:40:02,712
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

915
01:40:02,832 --> 01:40:14,992
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints and seers have built up for us a center of

916
01:40:15,112 --> 01:40:17,182
mastery.

917
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:27,722
But to open the center we have to have all the confidence, so please raise your hand

918
01:40:27,842 --> 01:40:39,351
and put it in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and say with full confidence

919
01:40:39,471 --> 01:40:52,692
to nourish this center, ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

920
01:40:52,812 --> 01:41:05,562
Please say this ten times.

921
01:41:05,682 --> 01:41:18,972
Now we have to know that we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

922
01:41:19,092 --> 01:41:23,782
we are not this intellect.

923
01:41:23,902 --> 01:41:28,592
We are not our conditionings or are we our ego.

924
01:41:28,712 --> 01:41:33,042
We are pure spirit.

925
01:41:33,162 --> 01:41:42,642
So now raise your hand to your heart and with full confidence say twelve times “Mother,

926
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:44,712
I am the spirit.”

927
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:54,592
Please say twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

928
01:41:54,712 --> 01:42:08,432
You have to know that this Divine Power is the ocean of love and compassion.

929
01:42:08,552 --> 01:42:19,272
It is the ocean of joy and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so there

930
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:28,351
is no mistake that you have committed which cannot be dissolved by this ocean.

931
01:42:28,471 --> 01:42:38,522
So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

932
01:42:38,642 --> 01:42:42,722
and turn your head to your right.

933
01:42:42,842 --> 01:42:57,422
Here you have to say with complete confidence again, “Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at

934
01:42:57,542 --> 01:42:58,422
all.”

935
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:17,002
Or you can call Me Mother – “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

936
01:43:17,122 --> 01:43:32,442
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

937
01:43:32,562 --> 01:43:45,682
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

938
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,862
– it’s a myth.

939
01:43:47,982 --> 01:43:52,612
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

940
01:43:52,732 --> 01:44:04,372
So put your right hand on your forehead and please bend your head, resting on the hand

941
01:44:04,492 --> 01:44:10,542
as much as you can and now press it on both the sides.

942
01:44:10,662 --> 01:44:19,262
And here please, please, say it from your heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

943
01:44:19,382 --> 01:44:28,121
Please say it from your heart - please say it, otherwise again I will have to work very

944
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:29,162
hard on you.

945
01:44:29,282 --> 01:44:34,262
So please say it from your heart – “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

946
01:44:34,382 --> 01:44:41,552
You are not going to miss your self-realization for not forgiving, please.

947
01:44:41,672 --> 01:44:57,262
How many lives you have been seeking the truth that this time you are not going to miss it

948
01:44:57,382 --> 01:44:58,262
out.

949
01:44:58,382 --> 01:45:51,702
Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back

950
01:45:51,822 --> 01:47:57,862
your head as much as you can resting on your

951
01:47:57,982 --> 01:48:28,272
hand

952
01:48:28,392 --> 01:48:51,952
and here for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

953
01:48:52,072 --> 01:49:10,632
please say, “Oh Divine, if

954
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:43,042
I

955
01:49:43,162 --> 01:50:08,121
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

956
01:50:08,241 --> 01:50:26,962
TAPE ENDS
