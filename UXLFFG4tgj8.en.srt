1
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:22,041
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

2
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:29,083
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

3
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,583
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

4
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,166
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

5
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,417
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

6
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,250
He is the source.

7
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,125
He’s the source of spirituality.

8
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,291
As a result of that all other things follow.

9
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,166
Like when it rains and is windy

10
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,125
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

11
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:39,166
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

12
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:45,125
we feel all these three things within and without.

13
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:56,333
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

14
00:03:56,333 --> 00:04:07,041
that the most important fundamental Deity

15
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:11,041
has been completely not only neglected,

16
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,125
but insulted and crucified.

17
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,583
So today though I did not want to say anything

18
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,041
to upset you people, but I must tell you

19
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:35,458
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

20
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,250
a thorough cleansing within you.

21
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,000
When you worship Shri Ganesha

22
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:50,125
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

23
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,250
keep your being clean -

24
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,333
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

25
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,417
Actually when the Kundalini rises

26
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,333
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

27
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,000
the innocence has to come up –

28
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:19,333
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

29
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:27,125
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

30
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:32,542
that we have to mature.

31
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,125
People are sick now.

32
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:45,208
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

33
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:50,500
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

34
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:58,083
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

35
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:06,166
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

36
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,333
there was nothing more important than that.

37
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:23,250
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

38
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,542
and the power of conditionings we have had.

39
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,458
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

40
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,542
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

41
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,583
terrible.

42
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,542
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

43
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,458
is not at all important.

44
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,583
It is only when you want to have children

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,458
actually a human being

46
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,166
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

47
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,166
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

48
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:14,125
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

49
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:28,125
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

50
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:35,458
it comes from a very low grading within us.

51
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,125
It comes from the low-graded human beings

52
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:50,083
that one becomes servile to it.

53
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,333
You should be the master of that.

54
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,166
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

55
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,333
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

56
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:15,125
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

57
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:22,041
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

58
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:29,125
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

59
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,291
and a pure personality.

60
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,458
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

61
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,291
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

62
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,125
I mean, you just don’t understand,

63
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:48,166
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

64
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:53,375
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

65
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,166
We have to mature ourselves.

66
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,083
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

67
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,542
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

68
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,041
But of course you must mature;

69
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,208
you need a tapasya for that.

70
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,375
Unimportant thing when become important

71
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:28,333
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

72
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,166
that we have, like we have hair.

73
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:34,291
Even if you lose hair it means something.

74
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,542
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

75
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

76
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,166
Such a waste of energy.

77
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,500
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

78
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,583
so much of auspiciousness is spent

79
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,500
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

80
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:09,250
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

81
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,291
we have to mature.

82
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,500
Maturity has to come within us.

83
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,208
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

84
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,417
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

85
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:36,166
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

86
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,250
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

87
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,250
or a pressure on people.

88
00:10:54,542 --> 00:11:01,291
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

89
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,375
for you people, very costly.

90
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,417
You have paid through so much;

91
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,000
you have gone through so much. For what?

92
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,583
So the priorities have to change

93
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,458
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

94
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:33,333
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

95
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:41,083
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

96
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,375
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

97
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,208
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

98
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,333
is the basic of this whole Creation;

99
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,291
is the essence of this Creation.

100
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:15,041
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

101
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,041
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

102
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,542
who are primitive, then comes the stage

103
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,291
where human beings are developed.

104
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:32,041
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

105
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,208
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

106
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,000
What is development is not outside.

107
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,458
What is the within development one has to see.

108
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,458
What have we grown inside?

109
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,250
What have we got inside ourselves?

110
00:12:53,333 --> 00:13:00,166
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

111
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,208
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

112
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,583
say, for example, I give you a mango.

113
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,291
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

114
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,458
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

115
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,500
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

116
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:29,500
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

117
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,208
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

118
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,125
What is our substance within ourselves?

119
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:50,333
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

120
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,458
So important for Him it was.

121
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,583
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

122
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,125
where of course morality is very important,

123
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,458
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

124
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:14,542
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

125
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:18,375
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

126
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,333
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

127
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,000
But it should be your own innate light,

128
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,125
that’s why Christ talked about it.

129
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:39,250
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

130
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:49,000
And I would not say that people were not warned.

131
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,583
Freud was not the only person who was born.

132
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:58,333
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

133
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,542
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

134
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:06,583
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

135
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,583
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

136
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

137
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:16,417
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

138
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,125
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

139
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,166
then the attack of the death, all these things.

140
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,458
I mean he was quite a recent person.

141
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:34,291
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

142
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:39,083
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

143
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:50,041
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

144
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,000
since long we know about hell.

145
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,375
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

146
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,208
This is hell.

147
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:14,375
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

148
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,000
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

149
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,208
Is it mental power that’s important?

150
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,208
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

151
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,500
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

152
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:39,542
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

153
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:46,291
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

154
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:52,333
What is your emotional power?

155
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:56,583
Emotions that you have takes you where?

156
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,375
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

157
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,083
Say, you love your wife very much.

158
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,125
Where does it take you?

159
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:16,083
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

160
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,458
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

161
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:26,000
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

162
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:33,291
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

163
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,291
She said, “How did you climb?”

164
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

165
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,125
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

166
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:45,083
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

167
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,458
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

168
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,166
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

169
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,375
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

170
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,417
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

171
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:10,125
which destroys others.

172
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,375
And the emotional power gives you

173
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:17,542
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

174
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:21,333
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

175
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,375
on such and such person and what did I get?”

176
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,166
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

177
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

178
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,125
Emotionally you are zero

179
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:50,125
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

180
00:18:54,542 --> 00:19:00,041
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

181
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,208
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

182
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:14,417
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

183
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,500
Then what is your power?

184
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,333
Is your chastity.

185
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:31,000
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

186
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:43,583
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

187
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:56,000
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

188
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,166
From the face of a person you can say

189
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,375
that this person is a chaste man.

190
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:15,166
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

191
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,458
the one who has never had sex in life,

192
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,166
always shining on his face.

193
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:25,500
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

194
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,041
who has so many wives.

195
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,166
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

196
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,583
So the whole energy is inside.

197
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,500
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

198
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:51,375
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

199
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:59,083
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

200
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,083
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

201
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:09,458
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

202
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:14,583
Because we kept to our own vehicle

203
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:19,375
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

204
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,041
We are so particular that others must respect us,

205
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:31,083
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

206
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

207
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,458
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

208
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,458
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

209
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,458
Many people think that way.

210
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,583
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

211
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,125
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

212
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,208
aesthetics, of course.

213
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,083
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

214
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,125
But culture you better learn from Indians.

215
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:33,125
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

216
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,291
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

217
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:44,583
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

218
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:59,542
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

219
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:05,041
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

220
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:15,041
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

221
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:20,375
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

222
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:26,250
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

223
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,417
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

224
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:34,458
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

225
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,417
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

226
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:44,000
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

227
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:49,083
you can not understand that there can be someone

228
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,458
who is absolutely chaste.

229
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,083
For a thief everybody is a thief.

230
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:04,166
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

231
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,208
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

232
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,333
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

233
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,500
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

234
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,083
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

235
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:27,500
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

236
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:32,041
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

237
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:36,291
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

238
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,250
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

239
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,208
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

240
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,250
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

241
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,375
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

242
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,375
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

243
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,542
You have to turn yourself out.

244
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:22,166
And this is one of the reasons why

245
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:25,166
people are very hot-tempered.

246
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:35,333
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

247
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,208
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

248
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,500
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

249
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:53,083
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

250
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:58,125
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

251
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:05,250
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

252
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:08,333
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

253
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,542
tomorrow you become a devil –

254
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:17,250
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

255
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:29,291
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

256
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,417
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

257
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:39,125
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

258
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,166
And that’s what will mature you.

259
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:03,458
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

260
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,583
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

261
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:10,000
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

262
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,083
who are innocent, simple people?

263
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:22,125
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

264
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:28,250
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

265
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,458
you really lag in the action of it.

266
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,583
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

267
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,583
it’s like that, something happens to you.

268
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,417
All the time you go on pinching people

269
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:49,166
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

270
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,125
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

271
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,542
And then end up in the divorce case.

272
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,583
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

273
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,083
I must tell you a very interesting story.

274
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:05,583
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

275
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,375
kissing each other all the time,

276
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,333
least bothered there are other people

277
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,291
who are also going on the same escalator.

278
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:16,250
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

279
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,500
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

280
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,166
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

281
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:31,542
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

282
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:35,166
They were not kissing.

283
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,291
I said, “What happened?”

284
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,083
“We are divorced.”

285
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,083
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

286
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,417
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

287
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,041
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

288
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:55,166
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

289
00:28:55,166 --> 00:29:00,166
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

290
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,333
All the time quarrelling with each other,

291
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:13,542
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

292
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:19,208
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

293
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:24,125
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

294
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,458
that you should never show your emotions outside.

295
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,041
But otherwise you can show anything else,

296
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:36,041
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

297
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,417
What an absurd place it is.

298
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,208
You have accepted all these values

299
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,458
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

300
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:02,000
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

301
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,208
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

302
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,291
I will never go to these psychologists.”

303
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,041
So I said, “Why?”

304
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:12,458
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

305
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,458
Imagine.

306
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,375
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

307
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:31,250
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

308
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,125
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

309
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:40,500
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

310
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:43,542
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

311
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:52,208
But there’s a real objection now,

312
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,458
that people when they go abroad,

313
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:58,083
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

314
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,000
and tease each other. What is the need?

315
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,417
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

316
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:11,500
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

317
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:16,250
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

318
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,208
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

319
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,000
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

320
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,333
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

321
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:35,208
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

322
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,166
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

323
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,041
whatever you have lost, you can.

324
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,291
That’s why the depth is lacking.

325
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,333
And this is the reason there is no consistency

326
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:03,208
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

327
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:09,458
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

328
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,083
and next day not even one, all lost.

329
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,417
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

330
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:24,000
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

331
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:30,583
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

332
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,083
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

333
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:40,375
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

334
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:54,333
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

335
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,375
“that you wear such and such dress,”

336
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:03,083
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

337
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:06,125
I can keep the whole night awake,

338
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,542
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

339
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:15,500
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

340
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,542
You have everything within you.

341
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:28,333
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

342
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:33,333
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

343
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:40,000
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

344
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,041
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

345
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,291
I’m here to tell you all about it.

346
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,417
You are so fortunate I am with you.

347
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,542
Do you understand that point?

348
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,542
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

349
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,417
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

350
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,583
You don’t have to do anything like that.

351
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:10,041
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

352
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:16,291
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

353
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:20,333
in the open they used to sit for hours together

354
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:25,291
Now that’s not necessary.

355
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:30,333
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

356
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:38,417
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

357
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:46,208
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

358
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,500
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

359
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:58,500
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

360
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,375
I told that “You better do some course.”

361
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:04,542
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

362
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:08,250
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

363
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,041
and do it up and finish it.

364
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:16,041
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

365
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:25,083
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

366
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:36,291
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

367
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,250
we start moving towards that more and more,

368
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,500
more and more and establishing ourselves

369
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
in the ocean of that joy.

370
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:54,083
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

371
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:58,375
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

372
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,333
you are very happy on the gross shore,

373
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:05,375
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

374
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:08,166
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

375
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:13,250
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

376
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:17,542
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

377
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,125
regularly, religiously.

378
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:27,375
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

379
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:33,417
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

380
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,417
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

381
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,166
And you know what mire is,

382
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:47,375
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

383
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,333
to come out of the water.

384
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,208
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

385
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,208
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

386
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,041
If you kick it, you go deeper.

387
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:08,000
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

388
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:12,083
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

389
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:16,458
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

390
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,125
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

391
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,041
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

392
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,417
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

393
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:28,000
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

394
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:34,250
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

395
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,125
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

396
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:47,125
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

397
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,291
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

398
00:37:56,583 --> 00:38:00,375
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

399
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:03,166
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

400
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:07,041
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

401
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,417
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

402
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,417
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

403
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,125
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

404
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,458
The reason is, why it is said,

405
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,166
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

406
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,500
who is the Mother Earth,

407
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,542
who acts through Mother Earth.

408
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:28,458
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

409
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,417
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

410
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:40,041
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

411
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:45,375
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

412
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:50,000
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

413
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,375
Just see the Mother Earth.

414
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:05,583
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

415
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:09,333
and compassion has done so much for us,

416
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:12,208
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

417
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:20,333
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

418
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:26,583
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

419
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:31,583
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

420
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,083
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

421
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:40,208
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

422
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:50,375
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

423
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:56,333
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

424
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:59,417
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

425
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:04,000
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

426
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:13,375
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

427
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,291
who always tries to amuse you,

428
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,291
always tries to say nice things,

429
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:25,000
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

430
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:33,291
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

431
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:39,291
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

432
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:47,458
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

433
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:55,041
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

434
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,125
just see and watch.

435
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:01,458
How they come round with little-little hands,

436
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,542
how they work it out.

437
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:10,333
How they know what is the right thing.

438
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,166
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

439
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,375
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

440
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,375
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

441
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:28,333
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

442
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,000
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

443
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,041
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

444
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,208
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

445
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,166
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

446
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,125
what you do know about my Grandmother?

447
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,542
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

448
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,333
and you put Her sari on the ground.

449
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:59,208
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

450
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,333
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

451
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:07,166
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

452
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:11,083
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

453
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:25,250
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

454
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,458
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

455
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,417
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

456
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:42,041
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

457
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,166
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

458
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,583
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

459
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:53,000
Because again, again the same thing.

460
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,041
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

461
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:02,291
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

462
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,125
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

463
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,375
the same restlessness within themselves.

464
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:12,458
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

465
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:21,000
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

466
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,458
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

467
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

468
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,291
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

469
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,208
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

470
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,083
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

471
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:44,333
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

472
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:48,000
but some of them I can tell you,

473
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,083
that there were three of them,

474
00:43:54,125 --> 00:44:03,458
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

475
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
about twelve o’clock on a road.

476
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:14,333
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

477
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:21,125
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

478
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,375
because where should we go and stay?”

479
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:28,542
I was amazed. These are the people

480
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,208
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

481
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:34,417
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

482
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,583
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

483
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,333
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

484
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,208
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

485
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:47,417
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

486
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:52,542
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

487
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,542
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

488
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:58,542
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

489
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:13,458
And the negative within us disappears

490
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,417
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

491
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,208
You can see it so clearly in another person.

492
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:29,041
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

493
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,041
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

494
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,125
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

495
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,000
very nice person, very nice person”.

496
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:45,583
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

497
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,125
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

498
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:55,083
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

499
00:45:55,125 --> 00:46:02,208
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

500
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,583
Even if you get your Realization,

501
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,500
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

502
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,458
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

503
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,375
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

504
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,333
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

505
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,542
it can never give the right picture.

506
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:37,000
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

507
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:41,500
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

508
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:48,500
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

509
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:55,375
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

510
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:58,083
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

511
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,041
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

512
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:07,375
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

513
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:10,083
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

514
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,583
then they want to have this.

515
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,291
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

516
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,125
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

517
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,291
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

518
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,000
and have come out and have spread light,

519
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:39,041
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

520
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,583
I’ve seen people like that.

521
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

522
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,500
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

523
00:47:56,333 --> 00:48:02,250
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

524
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,375
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

525
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,542
Let that be awakened within you.

526
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:17,000
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

527
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:24,000
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

528
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:29,125
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

529
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,500
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

530
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:37,333
At least you should have the taste of it.

531
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,333
I’m telling you about something

532
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,333
which you may not have heard before.

533
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,083
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

534
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:53,166
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

535
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:59,500
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

536
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,500
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

537
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:09,458
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

538
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:15,458
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

539
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:21,000
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

540
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:26,166
without the right time in Rome,

541
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:31,417
which is one of the basic things

542
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:34,250
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

543
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Romans started it and others carried on.

544
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:56,041
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

545
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:59,458
But the English must know

546
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,125
that they have got such a golden land

547
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:12,542
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

548
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:19,417
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

549
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:26,208
where even water beads also the snow –

550
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,417
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

551
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,125
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

552
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:40,041
Who washes the feet of His Father.

553
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:48,000
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

554
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:55,583
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

555
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:01,458
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

556
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:06,000
Just the opposite English were.

557
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:14,375
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

558
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:25,208
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

559
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,458
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

560
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:39,250
All unchaste people are arrogant.

561
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,291
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

562
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:49,417
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

563
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,583
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

564
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:55,166
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

565
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:10,458
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

566
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,083
And such a person also becomes insular

567
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:22,000
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

568
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:29,333
But a chaste personality is open,

569
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:32,083
why should he be afraid of anyone?

570
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:37,125
Talks to everyone nicely,

571
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:42,125
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

572
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:45,458
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

573
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,583
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

574
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:10,291
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

575
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,375
you’ll be thrown away.

576
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:28,000
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

577
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:32,208
because I reside within you as chastity.

578
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,583
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

579
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:43,291
I reside within you as chastity.

580
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,542
Chastity is never aggressive,

581
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:55,041
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

582
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:01,500
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

583
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:04,208
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

584
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,500
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

585
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:13,417
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

586
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,333
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

587
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,291
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

588
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:36,458
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

589
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,000
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

590
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,250
for these two years, very hard,

591
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,250
real tapasya we have to go into,

592
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,125
all of us, whether men or women.

593
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,542
And then we’ll see.

594
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:13,333
I can say that, we have done good job,

595
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:22,166
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

596
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,083
Have faith in yourself.

597
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:37,000
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

598
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,583
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

599
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:52,333
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

600
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,458
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

601
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,250
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

602
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,041
Why should you have faith in your wife?

603
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:04,125
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

604
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:09,458
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

605
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,417
how can your child be anything else?

606
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,083
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

607
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:27,458
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

608
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:35,500
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

609
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:41,000
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

610
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:48,291
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

611
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,458
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

612
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,041
in anything.

613
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:58,417
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

614
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,375
that you are emotionally attached to Me

615
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,583
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

616
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,375
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

617
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:11,333
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

618
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:15,041
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

619
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:23,500
Faith is something, which is volatile

620
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:32,208
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

621
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:40,000
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

622
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,583
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

623
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:51,417
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

624
00:57:51,417 --> 00:58:00,208
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

625
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,166
Can you believe it? What a power.

626
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:19,166
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

627
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:26,125
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

628
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,166
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

629
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:40,000
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

630
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,542
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

631
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:45,166
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

632
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:50,208
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

633
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,125
who are austere, not that.

634
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:58,166
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

635
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:09,208
which acts because it understands Me.

636
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:12,000
She understands Me. She knows Me,

637
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,500
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

638
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:21,125
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

639
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:27,417
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

640
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:30,000
Don’t waste your energy like this;

641
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,125
you are saints, live like saints.

642
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:42,250
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

643
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:46,375
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

644
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,583
something absurd, nonsensical.

645
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:52,500
We don’t have to attract anyone.

646
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,208
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

647
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,250
which attracts the bees,

648
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:05,458
is the honey of the flower,

649
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,208
is the essence of our existence.

650
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:23,333
So this time you are all coming to India,

651
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:31,250
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

652
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,542
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

653
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,583
and the films and all that nonsense.

654
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,041
You are above all that.

655
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:58,458
Attention, achievements are to be seen

656
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,083
from the seat of your chastity.

657
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,291
We can’t leave our seats,

658
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,125
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

659
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,417
We can’t leave our seat.

660
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,375
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

661
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:21,458
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

662
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:32,083
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

663
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:41,583
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

664
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,542
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

665
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,041
that you have acquired will drop out.

666
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,583
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

667
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,417
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

668
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:09,250
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

669
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:18,542
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

670
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:26,375
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

671
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:33,583
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

672
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:39,583
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

673
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:50,000
And when you worship Him, you must realize

674
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:54,041
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

675
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:59,000
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

676
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,166
you should abhor such a person.

677
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,250
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

678
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,417
just have nothing to do with that person.

679
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:20,083
Christ is innocence.

680
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,250
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

681
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:30,291
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

682
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:40,458
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

683
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:42,542
so that you never recognize Him.

684
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:56,375
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

685
01:03:56,375 --> 01:04:01,375
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

686
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:06,542
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

687
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,083
Try to be meditative. See things.

688
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:12,291
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

689
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:24,375
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

690
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:32,500
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

691
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,291
if possible day after tomorrow evening

692
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:45,458
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

693
01:04:47,041 --> 01:05:00,166
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

694
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,458
I really work very hard,

695
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,333
you have no idea how much I work hard.

696
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:10,208
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

697
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,542
that others should do all their work.

698
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,083
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

699
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:22,458
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

700
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,417
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

701
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,208
She should do meditation.

702
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,458
There is no saving.

703
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:41,333
You can save everything else if you just know

704
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:48,083
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

705
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:51,166
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

706
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:54,500
But first save yourself.

707
01:05:56,542 --> 01:06:01,166
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

708
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:06,542
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

709
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:12,417
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

710
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:16,125
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

711
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,542
Everyone can work it out.

712
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:22,000
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

713
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,542
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

714
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,375
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

715
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,166
I am thankful that all the people

716
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:37,250
have come from all over England.

717
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:40,458
It was right thing to do it in a way,

718
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:46,583
but this country must be created of that level

719
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:51,125
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

720
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,041
On the contrary it should not happen

721
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,417
that once they come to England,

722
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,417
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

723
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:09,542
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

724
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:13,333
that people have may be that it might become like that,

725
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,542
that once they come here they’ll say,

726
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,125
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

727
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:24,500
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

728
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,542
I have known some people that they came to England

729
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:32,458
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

730
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,291
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

731
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,417
“Mother nothing doing,

732
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:40,125
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

733
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:44,041
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

734
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,125
where you have worked for twelve years.”

735
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:57,083
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

736
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:03,417
and we have certain debts to be paid,

737
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:07,458
to be born in this country,

738
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:14,458
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

739
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,375
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

740
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:26,166
When you say that, “shut that window,”

741
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:30,166
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

742
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:33,583
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

743
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:44,458
Make others work is not the way.

744
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,291
You have to be really very dedicated.

745
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:51,083
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

746
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,291
Don’t look at other people who are here.

747
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:57,166
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

748
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,542
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

749
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:11,166
and that you have a special responsibility.

750
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:18,500
So may God bless you.

751
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,208
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

752
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:19,041
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

753
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,500
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

754
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,250
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

755
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:32,625
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

756
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:42,000
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

757
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,375
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

758
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:53,542
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

759
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:06,458
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

760
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:10,208
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

761
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:21,375
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

762
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:29,250
Through your punyas it should be.

763
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:45,500
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

764
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:49,458
through your punyas only.

765
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:04,083
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

766
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:09,250
The people who have to worship, we have to see

767
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,041
who are the people who have to worship.

768
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:17,250
Very difficult situation.

769
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:56,375
Get the small children, that’s the best.

770
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,208
Come along. Nira. Come along.

771
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:10,125
Yes, yes you both come along.

772
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:21,458
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

773
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,291
All of them should be below ten years.

774
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:00,291
Not below two but below ten.

775
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:03,291
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

776
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:28,166
Very good children, must say.

777
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:30,250
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

778
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:37,083
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

779
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:40,250
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

780
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,500
and you just have to rub. Alright.

781
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,083
Come along, four at the time.

782
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,458
Now who are the four?

783
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,166
She will put the water,

784
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:53,291
you rub, now you rub It,

785
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:56,166
you rub My Foot.
