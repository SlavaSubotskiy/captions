1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,820
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:27,170
At the very outset I have to say that truth 
is what it is.

3
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:38,880
You cannot change it, you cannot describe 
it and you cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,620
It is, it has been and it will be.

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:53,059
Now whatever I’m going to tell you today, 
you need not accept it blindfolded.

6
00:00:53,059 --> 00:01:02,850
We have had enough of trouble with blind faiths, 
but you must keep your mind open, like a scientist

7
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:13,340
and if it proves to be alright, if it proves 
what I am saying, as honest people you must

8
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:23,030
accept it, because it is for the benevolence 
of your being, for the benevolence of your

9
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:35,270
city, of your country, of the whole world.

10
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,900
Now, I would like to tell you what is the 
truth.

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:51,670
The truth is, that you’re not this body, 
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

12
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,030
you’re not that.

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,660
But you are the pure spirit.

14
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,870
This is the first truth about you.

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,140
And the second truth is, that there is a all-pervading 
power of Divine Love.

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,940
I hope you are all hearing me alright.

17
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,070
Are you alright?

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:21,210
There’s a all- pervading power of Divine 
love.

19
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,030
Is called by various names in the scriptures.

20
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,340
For example in the Bible it’s called as 
the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, also all-pervading

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,170
power of Divine Love.

22
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:42,470
Is called as ‘ruhx’ in Koran, in Sanskrit 
it is called as ‘Brahma Chaitanya’ or

23
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,810
‘Ritambara Pragnya’, by Patanjali Yoga 
Shastra.

24
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,810
Names can be anything.

25
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,340
Means the same thing.

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:01,960
That there is a subtle power, very dynamic 
power of Divine Love which does all living

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
work.

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,790
For example see these beautiful flowers here.

29
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:15,000
It’s a miracle, these flowers have come 
out of a small plant and the plant has come

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,319
out of a little seed and every flower is different, 
every type of a flower is different.

31
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,910
Then who runs our heart?

32
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,390
We never ask this question.

33
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,150
It’s a living process.

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,690
Who runs our heart?

35
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,380
The doctors will say it’s an autonomous 
nervous system.

36
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,030
But what is this autonomous nervous system?

37
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,670
Who is the auto behind it?

38
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,250
Everything that is living we take it for granted.

39
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,780
Even the scientists don’t enter that area, 
because they know they can’t find anything

40
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,860
there.

41
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:03,230
So how this living process is done, is a very 
miraculous thing which we accept without knowing

42
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:12,890
about it, but is this all-pervading power, 
which is very subtle and does this.

43
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:21,239
In every living action it is there.

44
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:29,419
Also it acts on the matter, in a way, like 
vibrations we know isometric, symmetric, all

45
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,529
these vibrations are there.

46
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:37,610
Now to say that God doesn’t exist is very 
easy.

47
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,610
To say that.

48
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,009
But it’s not proper, it’s not scientific, 
because you have not found out if there is

49
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,379
God or not God.

50
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:56,090
Without seeing that without finding it, if 
we just say that there is no God, then I think

51
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,259
is not proper.

52
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:02,870
There is a way to find it out.

53
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,870
Very simple way is as Stephen has already 
told you, we have this kind of a mechanism

54
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,860
within us built in, during our evolutionary 
process.

55
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,419
In the evolutionary process we have become 
human beings.

56
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,710
But we do not know the absolute truth.

57
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,259
We don’t know.

58
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,740
That’s why the problem.

59
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,750
Some say communism is good, some say capitalism 
is good, some say Christianity is good, some

60
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,500
say Islamic is good.

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,900
All kinds of things people talk.

62
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,439
That means everybody has a yarn in the head, 
which they start putting before us.

63
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,240
It’s just a mental projection.

64
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
It is nothing to do with the Absolute.

65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
If it was absolute [EVERY WOULD HAVE…del.] 
everybody would have agreed to it or accepted

66
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
it.

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,530
Now, I am sitting before you.

68
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,659
Is a fact.

69
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,689
You know it for truth, so nobody’s going 
to say that I am not sitting here.

70
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:10,719
In the same way if you know the absolute truth, 
then there cannot be any quarrel, fights,

71
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:14,819
any arguments, no wars.

72
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,960
This is the state we have to reach now where 
we all know the absolute truth.

73
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:29,219
And this is the absolute truth which I have 
told you already – what you are.

74
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:38,439
As a result of this happening, when you get 
connected through the awakening of this Kundalini,

75
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,629
this power is called Kundalini because ‘kundal’ 
means a coil.

76
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:52,999
It’s a Primordial Mother, expressing Herself 
as a reflection.

77
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,270
We have a concept of a Father, alright.

78
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,520
We have a concept of a Son, alright.

79
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,389
But we have no Mother.

80
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,219
That’s the Holy Ghost.

81
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,270
Has to be.

82
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,169
But in all other religions except for Islam 
and you can say the Jews.

83
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,809
Jews also have the concept of the Primordial 
Mother.

84
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:29,669
They have Motherhood but they, I don’t know 
why they evaded the problem of talking about

85
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,819
the Mother, the Primordial Mother.

86
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:39,969
So this is the reflection of the Primordial 
Mother in your triangular bone which is called

87
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,870
as sacrum.

88
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,819
That means the Greeks knew that it was a sacred 
bone why would they call it sacrum of all

89
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,819
the things?

90
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,629
And I found out it was so.

91
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:58,909
Now, the whole religion also the concept of 
religion becoming mental, it has gone astray.

92
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,759
Religion is within.

93
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,270
You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim anything, 
you can commit any sin.

94
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:13,120
If religion had anything in it, everyone who 
follows a particular religion would have been

95
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
sinless.

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,789
But they are not.

97
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,060
So that means that religion has to be awakened 
within us.

98
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,409
It has to be an innate religion.

99
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,249
Whatever religion it is it should be innate, 
which is not innate.

100
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:33,300
And that’s why whatever religion we may 
follow, we do not fall into line with what

101
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,919
is said in the religion.

102
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,190
Now, Sahaja Yoga, he must have told you ‘saha’ 
means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ is ‘born with

103
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,430
you’ – this right to become one with this 
all-pervading power.

104
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:53,230
We have no idea at all how glorious we are, 
what properties we have, what powers we have,

105
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:01,610
what is in us, we have no idea at all I would 
say, what we are capable of.

106
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:10,440
Because we are still not one with that all-pervading 
power.

107
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,209
Once this is awakened it passes through all 
these six centers, nourishing them.

108
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:23,160
Now the centers, the energy centres are our 
fundamentals.

109
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,490
The problems of the world if you see most 
of them come from human beings.

110
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,899
Those who have no peace within how can they 
have peace without?

111
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,690
In the same way there are so many things which 
are said, which are not there.

112
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:44,880
We know about priests in every religion are, 
about immoral, about.

113
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,830
Some are less some are more.

114
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
How can you be?

115
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,170
You are a priest, you are teaching something 
nice and inside you are immoral.

116
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,820
It is in every religion.

117
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,639
It’s nothing new.

118
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,750
That means they are just preaching, it’s 
just like a radio, something coming out but

119
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,250
nothing inside.

120
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,870
And that’s why many people feel that religion 
is useless, God is useless.

121
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,050
That’s what they felt in communistic countries.

122
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:20,660
When we don’t know ourselves how can we 
talk about anything?

123
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,690
Like we say this is my house, this is my car, 
this is my wife, this is my husband.

124
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,149
Everything ‘my’ but where is this ‘I’ 
to which all this belongs?

125
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:39,060
So we have to go within, and how can we go 
within, is the point.

126
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,490
To go within is impossible.

127
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,050
If I say that: ‘Please take your attention 
inside,’ you cannot take it.

128
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,190
So this happening takes place that this Kundalini 
rises.

129
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:58,810
By that happening your attention is pulled 
inside and when She rises, She pierces through

130
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:09,160
this fontanel bone area, and you are in contact 
with this all pervading power.

131
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,060
First thing happens that you start feeling 
cool breeze coming on your fingertips.

132
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,300
You start feeling cool breeze coming out of 
your own head.

133
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,060
You are amazed at it but the experience is 
very peaceful.

134
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:32,180
You feel extremely relaxed, and the eyes start 
sparkling.

135
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,560
As a result of this happening the first thing 
happens to you that you become peaceful.

136
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,110
Absolutely.

137
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,660
How?

138
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,920
See actually we are thinking, all the time 
our thoughts rise fall, rise fall.

139
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,250
In between these thoughts there’s a little 
space.

140
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,990
When we are thinking we are thinking about 
the future or about the past, not about the

141
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,310
present, we cannot think.

142
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,690
So when this Kundalini rises then these thoughts 
get elongated, and this space increases, and

143
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,470
that’s the place where you become thoughtlessly 
aware.

144
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,350
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

145
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,800
That’s the place, where you are in the present, 
and you are peaceful.

146
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,220
And that’s the state where you grow spiritually.

147
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,310
You cannot do meditation, you have to be in 
meditation.

148
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,470
Of course, you can’t pay for all this, is 
something, I don’t know how many times I’ve

149
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,240
told people, you can’t pay for your living 
process.

150
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,600
How much did we pay for our evolution?

151
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,370
How much, do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting 
the seeds?

152
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,310
So you can’t pay for it and it has been 
so.

153
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,879
I don’t know why people were so enamoured 
by people who were taking money.

154
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,220
I went to America, they said: ‘You don’t 
take money so we don’t believe you.’

155
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,000
I was surprised.

156
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,820
What sort of a logic is this?

157
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,850
‘How much should you pay me?’

158
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,310
I said.

159
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:15,270
The whole concept is that, everything is money, 
God is money, even your ascent is money, everything

160
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,509
you must pay.

161
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,769
And such funny ideas they had that, we are 
what we are giving him metal or something,

162
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,810
we are giving him nothing but a Rolls Royce.

163
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,230
But he gives us the spirit.

164
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,790
What spirit is he giving you?

165
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,939
He is mesmerizing you.

166
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,620
That’s what he’s doing.

167
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,259
You are not free.

168
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:41,350
You are mesmerized and under mesmerism you 
don’t understand what he’s doing to you.

169
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,779
And now thank God, ninety-nine percent of 
them are getting exposed.

170
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,550
But now new are coming up like mushrooms but 
still, if you understand that you can’t

171
00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:00,399
pay for your evolutionary process, you have 
understood me very well.

172
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:08,189
Now what happens when you get your realization 
as I told you, the first thing happens that

173
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:10,999
you become thoughtlessly aware.

174
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,470
Is a state.

175
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,999
In Sanskrit called as nirvichara samadhi.

176
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,380
The second state is doubtless awareness.

177
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,620
When this connection is in the beginning little 
loose, so, you have to work it out a little

178
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
bit.

179
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:36,079
Once you have worked it out and the connection 
becomes really, permanent, then what you find

180
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,230
is a complete flow of that power within you.

181
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:49,820
A new state another a new dimension in your 
awareness comes in.

182
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,509
That on your fingertips you can feel your 
centers, means self knowledge.

183
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,490
You know where what’s the problem is.

184
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:06,389
And on the same way, on the same fingers you 
can feel the centres of others.

185
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,189
So you are collectively conscious.

186
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:10,829
You know about others.

187
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:16,080
You don’t know what sort of dress they are 
wearing, what sort of complexion they have,

188
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,470
what race they come from, but what you know 
is what’s wrong with their centre, which

189
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,629
centre is in jeopardy.

190
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:34,360
Now, if you know how to correct those centers, 
your problem is solved and the problem of

191
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,550
others also you can solve.

192
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,540
In that enlightenment, what do you see?

193
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:53,050
You see yourself away from yourself in the 
sense that you start seeing, yourself as sometimes

194
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,430
as a stupid fellow.

195
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,459
Sometimes could be you might think, see that 
you are doing such wrong things to yourself.

196
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,279
You are destroying yourself.

197
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,069
In Sahaja Yoga we never say: ‘Don’t do.’

198
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,600
We never say because half of the people will 
run away.

199
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,629
So we say that alright let’s have the awakening.

200
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:14,550
Once you have the awakening then in that light 
you see.

201
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,320
I’ll give an example.

202
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Supposing I’m very obstinate, and think 
no end of myself, and is carrying the snake

203
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,379
in my hand.

204
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,769
It’s darkness and somebody tells me that 
this is a snake and it will bite you.

205
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,089
I say: ‘No.

206
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,410
[WHAT’S THE…del.]

207
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,740
What’s wrong?

208
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,850
Let me have, but it’s a rope.’

209
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,800
They said: ‘No, it’s a snake, please throw 
it away.’

210
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
No.

211
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Nobody will listen.

212
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,120
But if little light comes [IN THAT…del.] 
in that room or in that hall or wherever it

213
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,009
is immediately you throw away that snake.

214
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:53,930
So you become your own guide, and you understand 
yourself and you just give up all these things.

215
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,660
Without doing anything you just give it up.

216
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,740
In England we had great experiences of very 
terrible drug addicts.

217
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,760
Overnight they gave up.

218
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Overnight.

219
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,740
It’s very surprising.

220
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,910
All these problems, in the world today are 
because of ignorance.

221
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,940
Once you have the light you just give up all 
these things, without any difficulty, because

222
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,570
you find they’re destructive.

223
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,250
One doesn’t have to tell you don’t do 
it don’t do it.

224
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,660
It just happens.

225
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,800
You are empowered.

226
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,950
That you can control yourself and you know 
how to be with yourself.

227
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,430
But in the same way you can have an effect 
on others.

228
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,380
Supposing two persons are quarreling and a 
third person who’s a realized soul goes

229
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:51,420
there, suddenly the peace descends on them 
and suddenly they give up fighting.

230
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,680
So the power that is all-pervading you should 
understand, is such a dynamic power, is the

231
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:07,110
ocean of compassion, is the ocean of knowledge, 
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

232
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:15,530
So, when we feel very guilty, after realization 
you get rid of all these troubles.

233
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,760
People have all kinds of problems incurred 
upon themselves.

234
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,620
But in this light you see it so clearly and 
it manages.

235
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,410
It just disappears.

236
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:35,200
Now what is our problem now of this world 
is?

237
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,740
A scientist came to argue with me.

238
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,150
I said: ‘Answer only one question.

239
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,800
Why are you on this earth?’

240
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,660
He didn’t know what to say.

241
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,860
Madly he is finding out one thing, then another 
thing and another thing.

242
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,710
But I said: ‘Why are you here?

243
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,720
Just to find these things or is there something 
more?’

244
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,890
Couldn’t understand.

245
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,880
I said: ‘If I tell you, you’ll be happy 
to know, you have to enter into the Kingdom

246
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,580
of God, to enjoy His bliss, to enjoy His love, 
to enjoy His bounties.

247
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,990
This is why you are on this Earth.’

248
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,700
This is what it is, it answers this question 
this way.

249
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,380
The second thing that happens to you.

250
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,380
That you know Absolute Truth.

251
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,340
Now supposing, somebody comes from India from 
jail.

252
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,510
And wears a cloth of saffron color and starts 
saying some sort of Sanskrit words.

253
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,190
He’ll become a big guru anywhere.

254
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,460
Because he shows off like that you see, carries 
a drum of that kind.

255
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,230
He’ll become a big guru.

256
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,590
How will you know whether he’s a thief or 
not?

257
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,270
What you have to do is to just put your hands 
if you are realised souls.

258
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,950
Immediately you will feel, the burning of 
this fellow.

259
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,400
Immediately you’ll know what sort of chakras 
he is.

260
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,070
How cunning he is.

261
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,070
Immediately.

262
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,740
And after some times you don’t even have 
to put your hands towards him.

263
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,340
Immediately you’ll know what sort of person 
he is, what are his centers in danger, what

264
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,060
is happening to him.

265
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:19,320
Thus you can cure also physical ailments of 
yourself and of others.

266
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
You are so relaxed.

267
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,520
Now see, I’m seventy-one years of age.

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,770
I’ve been coming to Perth, I don’t know 
how many years I’ve been coming here.

269
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,940
And I’m travelling like this, I’m quite 
all right.

270
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,320
Because, you don’t worry.

271
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,370
You are so relaxed.

272
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,460
I mean people say: ‘Mother, you are traveling 
so much.’

273
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,380
I say: ‘I never travel, I’m just sitting 
in the aeroplane, that’s all I know.’

274
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,630
If I start thinking: ‘I’m traveling, I’m 
this.’

275
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,630
I never travel.

276
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,580
I’m just sitting nicely, I’m sitting here 
in the same, in the drawing room, I’m sitting

277
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
there.

278
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,990
What is there like travelling?

279
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,230
What’s so special.

280
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:06,110
Like that you see you become so relaxed, in 
your peace, that you don’t feel, your age,

281
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,880
you become so dynamic, and you become so compassionate.

282
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,890
You become extremely compassionate.

283
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,710
You become a very different person, very beautiful 
person.

284
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:25,150
I’ve seen who are married in Sahaja Yoga, 
people, are such good husband and wife.

285
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,840
Hardly any divorce.

286
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,670
One per cent maybe.

287
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,370
And they have beautiful children, who are 
born realised.

288
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,520
In your Perth also you have some of them.

289
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,820
You should meet them, you’ll be happy to 
meet them.

290
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,040
And so many problems which are so superficial 
also pass out.

291
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,370
Children become so dynamic.

292
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,320
I know one of my relations had some problems 
so he came to see Me.

293
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
And he got cured.

294
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,980
When he went back he told his son that I got 
cured because of this.

295
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,720
So he said: ‘Alright, now I’m going to 
do Sahaja Yoga.’

296
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,201
That boy, they had complained he’s not good 
for studies and he stood first in the whole

297
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:10,220
of Uttar Pradesh State, such a huge place, 
millions and millions appear for that matriculation

298
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
of theirs.

299
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,300
He stood first.

300
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
In our whole family nobody has come first.

301
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,460
We have first class, first many.

302
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,700
But not in the whole of UP, something so remarkable.

303
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,000
And the parents are surprised this boy never 
used to study much.

304
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,980
Now he’s taken life so well, he’s so matured, 
he’s so sensible.

305
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,970
This shows that all your capacities get enlightenment.

306
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,670
I’ve known, of very great artists coming 
out of Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,710
In your Sydney also you have one girl who’s 
gained a very big name out.

308
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,720
Then there are musicians, small children who 
are becoming great musicians.

309
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,980
There are artists, there are musicians, there 
are poets, orators, authors.

310
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,280
Suddenly, all their capacities start expressing 
themselves.

311
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,760
There’s a fellow who is a chartered accountant, 
he said I’ve never know any language very

312
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
well.

313
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
I’m a mathematician.

314
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,730
He writes such beautiful poems.

315
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,250
That is surprising.

316
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,730
How does he write?

317
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:18,020
Now the last song that they sung was written 
in the sixteenth century by a tailor, who

318
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,770
got his realization and is the song says: 
‘Oh Mother, give my yoga’ – means this

319
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,760
union with the Divine.

320
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,990
They are singing in the villages, everywhere 
in India, but nobody knows what it means.

321
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,200
They don’t know what it means.

322
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,300
Because of Western education we have given 
up all that is our, old knowledge, everything.

323
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,980
And we never bothered, to know what we have 
in our country.

324
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,060
This Western life has increased so much, it 
has grown so big.

325
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,890
Like a tree that becomes very big.

326
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,220
But it should seek its own roots, and it must 
gets its nourishment.

327
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,920
If this is the knowledge of the roots, why 
should we deny it.

328
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,290
Is very important.

329
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:10,320
As we learn science, from the West, the West 
must learn, the knowledge of the roots.

330
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,790
And if it can be proved then why not?

331
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:21,070
Now there are three doctors who have got MD 
degrees for Sahaja Yoga.

332
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,790
One has done on epilepsy, another has done 
on physical fitness, third one has done on

333
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,450
cancer or something.

334
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,740
So now they have got MDs.

335
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,350
And there’s the fourth one who’s doing 
some other research.

336
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,170
Asthma.

337
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,410
And they are very successful.

338
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,910
You don’t have to pay anything.

339
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,330
No medicine, nothing.

340
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,860
Just it works through your own powers.

341
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,210
About which you have no knowledge.

342
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,970
You don’t know what this power is like.

343
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,300
What it can give you.

344
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,240
So your attention itself becomes enlightened.

345
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,260
You pay attention to anyone after you have 
achieved the state of thoughtless awareness,

346
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,230
doubtless awareness, then you will know what’s 
wrong with that person.

347
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,040
Even of the dead, you will know what’s wrong 
with that person.

348
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,880
Physically you will find out what’s wrong.

349
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,450
Mentally you will find out and spiritually 
you can find out.

350
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:26,280
And all these three dimensions in us can found 
out by ourselves and can be improved.

351
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,490
In the same way we can improve others through 
our attention.

352
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:39,530
So dynamic, are our powers within ourselves.

353
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,800
And that’s what I’m saying we have to 
know our glory.

354
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,150
For example this instrument, if it is not 
connected to the mains it has no identity,

355
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,710
it has no meaning.

356
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,130
In the same way if we are not connected to 
this, all-pervading power we have no meaning

357
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,300
to our life.

358
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,690
So people are trying to find identification 
by coloring [COLORING…del.] their hair,

359
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,380
doing all kinds of things they do for identification.

360
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,520
Thank God it’s over now, all those.

361
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,770
Most of the fads are over.

362
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,770
Otherwise they used to always say one mantra: 
‘What’s wrong?

363
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,840
What’s wrong?’

364
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,800
When you are wasting your energy, time: ‘What’s 
wrong?’

365
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,850
Thank God recession has put them down a little 
bit and they are not doing all these horrible

366
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,380
things they used to do.

367
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,740
So now the attention is more introspective.

368
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,070
I think so.

369
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,280
Of the young people especially I was shocked 
the way some of the young people in England

370
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,400
were doing this, what do you call that I’ve 
forgotten, with the red hair business and

371
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:48,010
wasting fifty pounds for that kind of a hairdress 
which was quite funny you know and, they started

372
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,410
becoming blind.

373
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,730
So I said: ‘Why do you want to put this 
horrible color, you are becoming blind?’

374
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,500
So they said: ‘What’s wrong?

375
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Nothing wrong.’

376
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,770
Even if you say they are going to die: ‘So 
what’s wrong?

377
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,190
In any way we have to die.’

378
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:08,720
I mean the whole brain had taken a recession 
into itself.

379
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,640
It would not understand anything sensible.

380
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,460
But now somehow or other, people are maturing 
and trying to understand that identity is

381
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,360
within ourselves.

382
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,660
Like now take a say a good television set 
and take it to some remote village in India,

383
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,410
where they have never seen electricity.

384
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,440
And you tell them that from this you can see 
films and things they’ll say: ‘Oh, now

385
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,380
you are telling us stories.

386
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,840
It’s just a box.’

387
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,080
That’s how we think we are just a box.

388
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,560
Unless and until we are connected, we cannot 
know how great we are.

389
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,770
And that’s how we start condemning ourselves, 
suffering from depression, this, that frustration.

390
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,910
These are all artificial.

391
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:01,171
And they just drop out once you know what 
you are, what is your capacity, what you can

392
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:06,380
do, what are your powers.

393
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,870
So that, you get awakened and you can awaken 
others also.

394
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,260
This is another power you get that you can 
awaken other people.

395
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,420
You don’t have to ask Me to do that.

396
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,320
Anybody who is enlightened can do it.

397
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,410
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten 
hundred candles.

398
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,070
In the same way you can also do it.

399
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,210
And once you start doing it the joy is tremendous.

400
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,760
Here in Perth we have many people who are 
Sahaja Yogis and they are doing this work

401
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
here.

402
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,790
When I come only once a year here.

403
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,450
But I find that gradually they are maturing 
very well.

404
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,020
And they have all the knowledge.

405
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:56,130
All the knowledge about yourself, about your 
antaratma is called, the inside.

406
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,330
You should know everything about yourselves 
and about others.

407
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,850
Not the outside.

408
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,580
But the inside of it.

409
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
What is it?

410
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Why?

411
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Why do I behave like this?

412
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,610
Why do I accept this?

413
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,130
Why I don’t accept like that?

414
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,380
You see your ego, you see all your conditionings, 
you see everything clearly and you understand

415
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,610
what is good for you and you have power to 
give up what you want to give up.

416
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,080
You are not powerless.

417
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,490
You are not under any habit.

418
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,350
All the habits drop out.

419
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:31,230
The best part of it, best part of it I would 
say that you know absolute truth.

420
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,970
Also you can help others because in collective 
consciousness you are there.

421
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,260
Your attention is enlightened.

422
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:44,620
But the best is that you jump into the ocean 
of joy.

423
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,170
Joy is singular.

424
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,550
It is not like happiness and unhappiness.

425
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,480
Supposing somebody pampers our ego we are 
very happy you see.

426
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,960
Somebody punctures it we are very unhappy.

427
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,660
But with joy you become a witness.

428
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,770
You see the whole thing as a witness.

429
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,440
And you are in a state where just you enjoy 
everything.

430
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,780
Everything is so enjoyable, only thing little 
bit, your vision is marred.

431
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,140
Once you get that, that joy, then nothing 
can make you miserable.

432
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,181
If you see a problem of course you face it.

433
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,890
You face it bravely.

434
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,820
And you are not bothered.

435
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,650
And you are surprised that how you are helped 
by so many blessings.

436
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:34,190
If you have to believe in yourself the blessings 
come to you.

437
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,080
But you have to have faith in yourself.

438
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,600
Because also there’s a tendency: ‘Oh Mother, 
I’m a sinner.

439
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I’m this that.’

440
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,060
You see there’s nothing like that.

441
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,040
It’s all nonsense, people talk about sin, 
sin, sin, sin.

442
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,180
After all you’re human beings.

443
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
You are not gods.

444
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,070
If you have done mistakes, so what?

445
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,680
What does it matter?

446
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:00,090
After all, this great power is there, which 
is the ocean of forgiveness.

447
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,040
Ocean of forgiveness.

448
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,590
You don’t have to really torture yourself, 
and go on saying as this is wrong with me

449
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,370
that is wrong with me.

450
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,830
Just have faith in yourself I’m telling 
you and I’m sure this will work out tonight.

451
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,410
Of course I must say, that I respect your 
freedom.

452
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,820
It cannot be forced on you.

453
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,470
It cannot be.

454
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,970
I respect your freedom.

455
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,020
And as a result it is you who has to say yes.

456
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,000
I cannot force on you.

457
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,630
So those who don’t want to have their realization 
have to go away.

458
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,490
It helps you physically, mentally, emotionally.

459
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,200
I assure you it does.

460
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Also spiritually it helps you a lot.

461
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It works.

462
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,640
It’s your own power.

463
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
No doubt.

464
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,390
And there’s no complication with it, at 
all.

465
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,340
No complication of any kind.

466
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,380
But if you don’t want to have it, how can 
I force it on you?

467
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,920
It cannot be forced.

468
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:10,970
It’s a living process, of your choice, the 
last breakthrough of your evolution.

469
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:19,480
That’s what I request you, that you should 
just decide on this point yourself.

470
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,290
All religions have talked about it.

471
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,360
Christ has said: ‘Know thyself.’

472
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,390
In the Bible it is: ‘I’ll appear before 
you like flames, like silent flames.’

473
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,870
You do see those chakras like that.

474
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,860
Every…Buddha has said it, everyone has said 
the same thing.

475
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:45,110
Even in the Koran it is written that: ‘At 
the time of resurrection, kiama, your hands

476
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,570
will speak and they’ll give witness against 
you.’

477
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,960
I mean He has said it, much more clearly than 
anybody else.

478
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,110
So all the religions have said that you have 
to know yourself.

479
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,180
No doubt about it.

480
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,060
But no [RELIGION HAS …del.] outside religion 
has tried that.

481
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,530
Nobody has tried to tell people you have to 
know yourself.

482
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,110
They all have become either power oriented 
or money oriented, not spirit oriented.

483
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,450
That’s the problem is.

484
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,320
So I would request people who don’t want 
to have realization to go away, because it

485
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
won’t work out.

486
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,970
If you are not there it won’t.

487
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,940
It doesn’t work for people who are adamant, 
who are arrogant, also for people who are

488
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,620
idiots you see, it doesn’t work out.

489
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,530
I’m sorry to say.

490
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,090
If you have some problem, physical, mental, 
emotional, even spiritual then maybe, it might

491
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,500
be delayed but everybody gets it.

492
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,490
So far I’ve seen anybody who has come to 
Sahaja Yoga has got it.

493
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:50,420
And got it very well.

494
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:58,070
So, I would request you … I know you all 
have some questions also.

495
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,410
To be asked.

496
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,750
But I would say that, it is better that you 
write them and send it over to Me.

497
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:12,429
Because just now the whole atmosphere is built 
in and I think people should get their realization

498
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,460
first.

499
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,649
Then you’ll have no questions.

500
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:21,050
Because questions you see now, I’ve been 
working for about twenty-three years, I know

501
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,240
all these mental acrobats, I know.

502
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,490
I can answer every question very well.

503
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,890
Make you laugh also.

504
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:35,370
But, the main thing is realization and if 
you have this mental diversion then perhaps

505
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,210
maybe, you might miss the point.

506
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,090
So the best thing is that you get your realization 
which is your right and then, we’ll talk

507
00:34:42,090 --> 00:35:04,800
about it.

508
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,040
Now what one has to do is to take out the 
shoes that’s all.

509
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,590
It’s not a too much of a thing doing this.

510
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:29,410
Because this Mother Earth takes away our problems.

511
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:38,410
So now we are on our way, to know how fantastic 
we are and to enter into the Kingdom of God.

512
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,180
So we have to be very kind to ourselves.

513
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,310
See actually, I think, we must really have 
respect for ourselves.

514
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,870
Very important.

515
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,550
There are three conditions.

516
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:03,760
The first one is, that, you have to forgive 
yourself.

517
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,940
Just forgive yourself.

518
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,300
Means you should not feel guilty, at all.

519
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,140
Perhaps you don’t know if you feel guilty 
what happens is on the left side this centre

520
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,070
catches and that gives you spondylitis.

521
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,130
It might also give you angina and maybe lethargic 
organs.

522
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,440
It’s a terrible thing to have this centre 
caught up.

523
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,370
So what’s the need to feel guilty?

524
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,690
I mean in anyway you are punishing yourself 
for nothing at all.

525
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,260
So please don’t feel guilty.

526
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,920
I mean people feel guilty for all kinds of 
nonsensical things.

527
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,740
Like somebody spilled, say coffee.

528
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,740
Finished.

529
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,350
All his life he’ll remember: ‘Oh my God, 
I spilled the coffee on the carpet.’

530
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:52,360
It’s nothing important.

531
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,240
So please don’t feel guilty.

532
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,450
That’s one point.

533
00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:02,320
That’s very important because if this centre 
is caught up the Kundalini won’t rise.

534
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,660
Now the second condition is, that you have 
to forgive everyone.

535
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,110
Now some say it’s very difficult to forgive 
anyone.

536
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,990
Logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive 
you don’t do anything.

537
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,360
What do you do?

538
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,630
Nothing.

539
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,890
But actually you play into wrong hands.

540
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:29,260
The persons who have harmed you or troubled 
you or made you unhappy, are happy.

541
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,150
While you are torturing yourself.

542
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,570
Logically.

543
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,990
So why torture yourself for nothing at all?

544
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,230
Don’t even think about them.

545
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,150
To just say in general: ‘Mother, I forgive 
everyone.’

546
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,150
Just say it.

547
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,490
And it will be done.

548
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,300
You’ll feel much lighter, I tell you.

549
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,510
Must forgive.

550
00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:06,650
There’s a way to understand that, at this 
moment you have to be free from all this nonsense.

551
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,650
Why?

552
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,310
Because this center is, like this – agnya.

553
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,280
The optic chiasma goes like this.

554
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,010
[SHRI MATAJI DEMONSTRATES] Like that it is.

555
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,250
If you don’t forgive it won’t open.

556
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,920
Now, it has to open like this, if the Kundalini 
has to pass through it.

557
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,540
Now if you don’t forgive, this will remain 
like this.

558
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:36,480
All your life you have tortured yourself and 
at this moment you’ll miss the point.

559
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,800
So why not forgive?

560
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,130
Just forgive.

561
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,130
Forgive everyone.

562
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,070
And third.

563
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,400
The most important.

564
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,730
Is the condition that you all should have 
confidence that you all can get your realization.

565
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,690
Whether you belong to Australia, India or 
Timbuktu.

566
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,950
You all can get your realization tonight.

567
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,930
This is very important.

568
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,790
Have confidence in yourself.

569
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:11,330
Moreover, you have to know that this is not 
an individual happening.

570
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,640
It’s not that you are getting your realization 
and another isn’t.

571
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,690
It’s ‘en masse’.

572
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,920
That’s the new thing is an ‘en masse’ 
realization.

573
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,640
Say in Russia sixteen thousand people get 
realization.

574
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,760
How it has worked out?

575
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
We should say God alone knows.

576
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,770
But it has worked out.

577
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:35,180
Now, once it happens, to you, you cannot sit 
at home and say: ‘Oh yes Mother, I’m meditating.’

578
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
No, no.

579
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,900
You have to come to the collective.

580
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,370
You don’t have to pay anything.

581
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,370
No, no, no.

582
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,980
It’s not that this is introduction letter 
and then your purses are polished off.

583
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,070
It’s not like that.

584
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,490
It is, it is just you have to attend.

585
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,890
You have to go for meditation with others, 
collectively.

586
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,570
It’s a collective happening.

587
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,150
Supposing a nail is taken out of your finger.

588
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,400
It will never grow.

589
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,650
In the same way it’s a collective happening.

590
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,670
And Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty nations.

591
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,530
And the thousands and thousands of people 
who are self realized.

592
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,680
They are all your part and parcel.

593
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,360
If one person gets into trouble in any place, 
all of them will jump at it and try to see

594
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,960
that that person is saved.

595
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,570
So you have so many brothers and sisters.

596
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,300
Real brothers and sisters I should say.

597
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,290
They are not only blood relations but they 
are spirit relations.

598
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:37,280
So, I have to request, that please don’t 
finish it here.

599
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,490
Stephen told me he has a funny experience 
of the Australians but it’s common with

600
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,220
everyone I must say.

601
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,970
That some people get it a very high experience 
so they forget it.

602
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,070
They just enjoy it for while, til after one 
year they come down when You are here and

603
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,470
they are not bothered.

604
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,110
But those who get little bit they just come 
and say now what’s in it.

605
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,790
I’m getting burning here.

606
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,560
I’m doing this.

607
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Why?

608
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:12,110
But those who get it in a big way should, 
become easily doubtlessly aware people and

609
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,400
they have so many powers.

610
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,190
And they should do a lot.

611
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,190
Why?

612
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,820
They should help others who are feeling little 
bit less.

613
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,340
So it is something, human nature I think, 
the way it acts.

614
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,140
But it’s not Divine nature.

615
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,730
Divine nature is when you become Divine, then 
you want to give.

616
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,730
You have the light.

617
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,730
You want to give.

618
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,270
Till this candle was not enlightened it was 
alright, it was trying to get enlightened.

619
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,940
Once it was enlightened it is giving light.

620
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,010
When you have the light you have to give it 
to others.

621
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,710
And that’s what is the most enjoyable thing.

622
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,040
For that you don’t have to pay, again.

623
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,820
But you have to give some time to yourself, 
some respect to yourself, and some meaning

624
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,980
to your life.

625
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,740
You’ll be amazed how it will give you such 
a joy that you can do all these things.

626
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,280
May God Bless You.

627
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,230
Now, I’ve told you again three conditions.

628
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:20,310
And I hope you have understood my three conditions 
are very simple if you look at it because

629
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,380
all these things are there because of a myth.

630
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,630
It’s a myth.

631
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,170
That to feel guilty is a myth.

632
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,500
Not to forgive others is a myth.

633
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,380
And not to have confidence is another myth.

634
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,910
So we should get out of this and we should 
have full confidence that we’ll get our

635
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,910
realization.

636
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,530
You all can get it I promise you.

637
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,990
All of you.

638
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:52,930
I hope you have taken out your shoes.

639
00:42:52,930 --> 00:43:00,560
As Stephen has already told you there are 
two powers, left and right, we have to put

640
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,840
both our feet like this on the Mother Earth.

641
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,970
Alright.

642
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:17,460
Now, please take out your shoes that’s all.

643
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:24,470
Now you have to put both the hands towards 
Me like that.

644
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,050
Keep your eyes open.

645
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,160
For the time being.

646
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,260
You should be comfortable.

647
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,320
Very comfortable.

648
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:54,280
There should be no discomfort in your body.

649
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,840
Now please put your left hand towards me – on 
your lap you can put it or sideways wherever

650
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,310
you feel comfortable and the right hand on 
your heart.

651
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:12,400
Keep your eyes open because just now I’ll 
tell you what is to be done.

652
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,680
This we have just to do that you should know 
how we are clearing your centers.

653
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,070
Now we are working only on the left side with 
your right hand and the left hand is towards

654
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:28,181
Me which indicates that you have a desire 
because this is the power of desire, that

655
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:30,850
you have a desire that you get your realization.

656
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:38,500
So please put your right hand on your heart 
now.

657
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,880
In the heart resides the spirit.

658
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,960
Now you take your right hand upper portion 
of your abdomen on the left hand side and

659
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,230
press it.

660
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:59,220
If you are the spirit you become your own 
master and this is the centre of your mastery

661
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:09,910
which is created by great masters, and prophets.

662
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:15,250
Now please take your right hand in the lower 
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

663
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:21,300
This is the centre of pure knowledge.

664
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:28,530
Means the knowledge about the laws which are 
Divine.

665
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:34,700
Surprisingly the center is so low as that.

666
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:41,550
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion 
of your abdomen again.

667
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,960
Then onto your heart.

668
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:54,730
Now raise your right hand in the corner of 
your shoulder and your neck and put your head

669
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,180
to your right.

670
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:06,050
This is the center I’ve told you when you 
feel guilty gets into jeopardy.

671
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:16,530
Now please take your right hand on top of 
your forehead across, and put down your head.

672
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,270
This is the center where we have to forgive 
everyone which we’ll do later on.

673
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,250
I’m just telling you now.

674
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:29,010
Now please take your right hand on the back 
side of your head and push back your head.

675
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:36,590
Just for your satisfaction, here you have 
to ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power.

676
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,690
Now the last center.

677
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,410
Is very important.

678
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:47,240
Stretch your hand fully and put the center 
of your hand on top of the fontanel bone area

679
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,470
which was the soft bone on our head.

680
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:55,250
So now put down your head a little bit.

681
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:01,500
As far as possible if you can put it would 
be nice.

682
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:08,610
Now press it hard by pushing back your fingers 
and move your scalp.

683
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,390
Move your scalp more, clockwise.

684
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,400
Seven times.

685
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:23,270
Please move your clockwise hand to move the 
scalp – seven times.

686
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,890
Put down your head please.

687
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,670
That’s all you have to do.

688
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,990
That’s all.

689
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,470
More than sufficient.

690
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:43,600
Now, you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, 
whatever suits you.

691
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,040
Take out your spectacles will be better because, 
it might help your eyesight also.

692
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,340
Now close your eyes.

693
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,530
Please close your eyes.

694
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:00,470
Put left hand towards Me, right hand on the 
heart and put both the feet apart from each

695
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,900
other.

696
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,400
Be comfortable.

697
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:16,010
Now, here you have to ask Me a very fundamental 
question about yourself.

698
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,510
Ask a question: ‘Mother am I the spirit?’

699
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,170
Ask the question in your heart.

700
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,950
‘Mother am I the spirit?’

701
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:35,950
Ask three times.

702
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:44,400
Now, as I told you if you are the spirit you 
become your own master.

703
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:51,270
Now please take your right hand, on the upper 
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

704
00:48:51,270 --> 00:49:02,609
and press it and here you ask another question 
three times: ‘Mother, am I my own master?’

705
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:18,770
I’ve told you that I respect your freedom 
and you have to ask for pure knowledge.

706
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,380
I cannot force it on you.

707
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,300
So please take your right hand in the lower 
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

708
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:37,010
Here now press it hard and ask another question: 
Again six times because, this center has got

709
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,609
six petals.

710
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:50,980
Ask six times for, pure knowledge: ‘Mother 
please give me pure knowledge.’

711
00:49:50,980 --> 00:50:07,660
Ask six times.

712
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:13,760
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the 
kundalini starts rising.

713
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,160
So, we have to open our upper centers with 
full confidence.

714
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,410
Have full confidence in yourself.

715
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,910
Now please raise your right hand the upper 
portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand

716
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,630
side.

717
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:45,680
Here, with full confidence you have to say 
ten times: ‘Mother, I am my own master.’

718
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,380
Please say this ten times.

719
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,520
‘Mother, I am my own master.’

720
00:50:50,520 --> 00:51:01,840
With full confidence.

721
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,840
I have already told you that you are the pure 
spirit.

722
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:11,940
You are not this body, mind, emotions, egos, 
conditionings.

723
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,530
But you are the pure spirit.

724
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:19,710
So now please put your right hand on your 
heart and with full confidence you have to

725
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:30,420
say, twelve times in your heart: ‘Mother 
I am the pure spirit.’

726
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:47,800
Please say it, with full confidence.

727
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:55,590
I have already told you that this all-pervading 
power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of

728
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:00,550
blessings but above all it is the ocean of 
forgiveness.

729
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,970
So please forgive yourself and raise your 
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

730
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:13,230
and, on the left-hand side and turn your head 
to your right.

731
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:20,869
Here you have to say with full confidence: 
‘Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not

732
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:21,869
guilty.’

733
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:27,780
Please say it, sixteen times.

734
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,150
I have already told you, if you forgive or 
don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

735
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:39,290
But if you don’t forgive then, you play 
into wrong hands and at this moment it’s

736
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:45,480
very important that you forgive because this 
center of agnya is very constricted and has

737
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,230
to be opened out.

738
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,109
So please help yourself.

739
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:57,109
Now, raise your right hand on top of your 
forehead across and please put down your head

740
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:00,080
as far as possible.

741
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:12,130
Here, it’s not how many times, but from 
your heart you have to say: ‘Mother I forgive

742
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,890
everyone.’

743
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:20,700
Not how many times but from your heart: ‘Mother 
I forgive everyone.’

744
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,190
In general.

745
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,140
You don’t remember each and every person.

746
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,660
You don’t have to think about any one of 
them.

747
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,630
Just say in general from your heart.

748
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,970
This is very important.

749
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:46,530
Now, only for your satisfaction, without feeling 
guilty, without counting your mistakes, please

750
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:54,320
put your right hand on the back side of your 
head and push back your head.

751
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:07,660
Here, again you have to say from your heart, 
not how many times: ‘Oh Divine Power, if

752
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,869
I have done any mistakes please forgive me.’

753
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:14,020
Just say that for your satisfaction.

754
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,130
Don’t feel guilty about it.

755
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:24,700
From your heart please say: ‘Oh Divine Power, 
if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly

756
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,700
please forgive me.’

757
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:38,250
Please push back your head.

758
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,920
Now the last center.

759
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:47,640
Please stretch your hand fully, your palm 
specially and put the center of your palm

760
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,050
on top of the fontanel bone area, which was 
a soft bone in your childhood.

761
00:54:53,050 --> 00:55:00,490
Now, push back your fingers – very important, 
that will give a nice pressure, now put down

762
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,690
your head.

763
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:07,170
Here again I cannot, cross over your freedom.

764
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,880
You have to ask for your self-realization.

765
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,900
I cannot force it on you.

766
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:21,280
So please try to move your hand clockwise, 
seven times so that the scalp moves, nicely,

767
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,350
with the pressure and here you have to say, 
seven times: ‘Mother, please give me my

768
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,490
self-realization.’

769
00:55:28,490 --> 00:56:03,310
[SHRI MATAJI BREATHES INTO THE MICROPHONE] 
Now please take down your hands.

770
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:15,530
Open your eyes slowly and put both the hands 
towards Me like that.

771
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:24,650
Now, put the right hand towards Me and put 
down your head and see with your left hand

772
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:30,440
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming 
out of your fontanel bone area.

773
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,480
Don’t put it on top – above, above it.

774
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,940
Some people get it close and some people get 
it very far.

775
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,720
So just try to see if there’s a hot or a 
cold breeze coming out of your head.

776
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,560
This is the heat coming out of you.

777
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:55,190
If you have not forgiven the heat will be 
there so please try to forgive now.

778
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:59,200
Now please put left hand towards Me.

779
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,790
Now bend your head again and see for yourself.

780
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,080
You have to see yourself, nobody’s going 
to certify.

781
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,650
Please see if there’s a hot or a cool breeze 
coming out of your head.

782
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,480
Again I would request you to forgive everyone 
so that heat goes away.

783
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:24,210
Ultimately it will become cool, very cool.

784
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:42,230
Now lastly, with the right hand.

785
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:45,359
Now raise your both the hands towards the 
sky.

786
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:50,050
Push back your head and ask one question, 
one of these questions three times.

787
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,740
You can ask: ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze 
of the Holy Ghost?’

788
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,650
‘Mother is this the all-pervading power 
of Divine Love?’

789
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:05,150
Otherwise: ‘Mother is this the ruhx, is 
this the paramachaitanya?’

790
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:12,550
Ask any one of these questions three times 
– any one.

791
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:18,180
Now put down your hands, please.

792
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,900
Now put your hands like this towards Me.

793
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,930
You can wear your glasses also.

794
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:26,670
Put your hands like this.

795
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,190
And don’t think, just don’t think.

796
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,580
Watch Me, don’t think.

797
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,820
You can do it.

798
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:53,300
All those who have felt the cool breeze in 
their hands please raise both your hands.

799
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,290
Just raise it like that, otherwise I can’t 
see.

800
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,790
It’s very good.

801
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:59,790
Imagine.

802
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,790
Perth.

803
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,790
I bow to you all.

804
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,790
Really.

805
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:03,790
Bow to you.

806
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,900
You’ve received your connection.

807
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,330
No doubt.

808
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:11,960
I’m getting cool breeze from you.

809
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,400
And now only thing is you have to grow.

810
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,370
Some people haven’t got it so we’ll have 
to look at them, what’s the problem is.

811
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,820
May be some problem there.

812
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,170
But most of you have got it.

813
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:32,170
Those who have got it or not got it, please 
you must come and attend our follow-up places.

814
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:40,640
They have got some sort of a program after 
this where they will explain to you everything.

815
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,150
And you will achieve your ultimate goal, is 
to know everything about it.

816
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,270
Everything.

817
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,530
I promise you, you will get it.

818
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:53,240
But give some time to yourself.
