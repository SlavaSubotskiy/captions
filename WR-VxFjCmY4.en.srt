1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:01,455
 

2
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:28,405
 

3
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,625
Please, be seated

4
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:36,475
 

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:53,580
[Hindi]...

6
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,460
 

7
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,355
 

8
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:03,915
 

9
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:09,845
 

10
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:12,915
 

11
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
 

12
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,060
Don't cross the limits of Shri Mataji's chair. You, there. All right.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,680
So with Shri Mataji's blessings, and thanks to the teaching of "Maushi" [aunt in Marathi],

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,220
we would like to present you with a "Bharood" [Marathi religious song] by Sant Eknath.

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,640
It's a song that, in a style that

16
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,560
is designed to teach people

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,480
what will happen to them if they don't behave in a, in the correct way.

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,660
In this particular song, Sant Eknath is talking about what happens to people

19
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,100
if they're not if they trick people badly.

20
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,060
If they are, if they are rude to them if they cheat them.

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Sant Eknath gives example in particular

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
of Duryodhana

23
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,980
who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
and it was eventually his brother,

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,720
the brother of Duryodhana drag Draupadi into the cour to be humiliated.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,440
And was eventually punished by Bhishma,

27
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,100
Bhishma, Bhishma [Bema]

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,180
[Bema]

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,940
who was punished by Bhishma in a dual.

30
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:44,080
In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita was duly punished by Shri Rama.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,560
And so on in many cases.

32
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,240
In reality, there are only four people that Sant Eknath mentions

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,700
who are free from any kind of problem in his regard.

34
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,960
For example, Bhishma and Hanumana,

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
those two are examples.

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,280
Sant Eknath concludes the song

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,800
inviting us to be

38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,620
to be sweet with each other and not to abuse each other.

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,420
Otherwise- cause if we do, then our fate is a very ugly one.

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,700
Give me a microphone for tablas.

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
 

42
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:08,645
 

43
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,675
 

44
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,485
 

45
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,115
 

46
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:30,555
 

47
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,805
 

48
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:33,985
 

49
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:36,595
 

50
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,605
 

51
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,445
 

52
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,135
 

53
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,625
 

54
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:48,585
 

55
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:14,465
 

56
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:16,675

282
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,300
...For their very kind and very appreciate for their treatment

283

and everything that they did for me and my daughter

284
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,420
I have no words to give them my gratitude.

285
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,020
And then I need not add

286
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,400
that my greatest thanks are to Shri Mataji

362
00:56:58,605 --> 00:56:59,605
 

363
00:57:10,715 --> 00:57:11,715
 

364
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,545

370
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,395
 

371
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:40,605
 

372
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:52,825
 

373
01:00:53,595 --> 01:00:54,595
 

374
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:24,455
 

375
01:01:39,525 --> 01:01:40,525
 

376
01:02:10,745 --> 01:02:11,745
 

377
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:16,925
 

378
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:20,945
 

379
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:30,335
 

380
01:06:45,925 --> 01:06:46,925
 

381
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:51,485

383
01:10:54,095 --> 01:10:55,095
 

384
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:05,245
 

385
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:09,955
 

386
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:22,475
 

387
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,240
 

388
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:12,160
Shri Mataji has suggested a new name for this raga

389
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:17,540
Since this is a gift from the disciple to the guru

390
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,400
and guru is synonymous of "Purnima" that is the full Moon,

391
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:28,980
Shri Mataji says that this raga should be called "Chaitanya Purnima".

392
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,980
That means-

393
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,860
I think this is the biggest award a disciple can expect from a guru,

394
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,060
that She has blessed this raga with a very wonderful name.

395
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,060
Jai Shri Mataji

396
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,740
 

397
01:17:11,785 --> 01:17:12,785
