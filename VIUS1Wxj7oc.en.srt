1
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:10,137
and the three processes

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:13,514
through which we pass.

3
00:00:15,698 --> 00:00:18,191
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

4
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:25,215
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,839
of the moon, where they say that

6
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:33,395
the housewife has to be given some present.

7
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:39,869
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

8
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:44,900
So people give her some utensils, actually

9
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,587
it’s a very mutual thing, because

10
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,046
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

11
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:01,399
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

12
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:06,758
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

13
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:15,946
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

14
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:23,095
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

15
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:30,817
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,999
So Shiva and Parvati were married

17
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:42,300
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

18
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:46,452
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

19
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:51,899
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

20
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:54,835
called as Narakasura.

21
00:01:56,041 --> 00:02:00,800
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

22
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,349
It is something like Halloween, that day.

23
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,027
Because that is the day they opened

24
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:13,152
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

25
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:19,472
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

26
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,322
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,689
because some of them might be hanging around still.

28
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,539
It’s better to allow them to get out.

29
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,562
I mean in the realm that you are

30
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,275
you do not feel much their existence.

31
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:41,396
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

32
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,538
people see even some of the spirits

33
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,613
and also can feel their existence,

34
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,553
they see the black spots and all that.

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,691
So that day is very dangerous,

36
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:59,420
but because Narakasura was killed,

37
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,458
people celebrated.

38
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:08,633
That celebration is expressed next day,

39
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:13,320
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

40
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,283
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

41
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,632
they think that

42
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:22,844
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

43
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:28,245
from the sea as I told you last time.

44
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:33,862
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

45
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,771
because in India in the north,

46
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:42,174
that’s the time people finish their crops

47
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:47,855
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

48
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:49,641
And,

49
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:58,570
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

50
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:01,116
we need not use that,

51
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:06,330
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

52
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:11,355
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

53
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:16,174
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

54
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,898
calendar and they celebrate that.

55
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:22,264
So all these things are nothing is rigid

56
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,629
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

57
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,228
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

58
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:33,047
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

59
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,833
The whole festival system is for your happiness

60
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,640
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

61
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:43,965
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

62
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:48,040
needs and understanding.

63
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,311
And also according to your

64
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,535
national way you live.

65
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,675
They should be no addiction to any

66
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:04,524
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

67
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:08,237
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

68
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,160
They don’t have these festivals.

69
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:13,475
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

70
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,618
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

71
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,435
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

72
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,414
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

73
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:28,921
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

74
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,793
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

75
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,184
Why miss the chance, you see.

76
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:41,215
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

77
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:57,875
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

78
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,352
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

79
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:04,927
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

80
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,178
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

81
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,129
And have the best of it.

82
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:15,579
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

83
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,941
the more you know, the better it is.

84
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:20,666
And have all kinds of sweets,

85
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:24,255
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

86
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,957
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

87
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,912
we have to be more festive.

88
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:38,512
Now the last day is very important,

89
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,507
is a very universal day I should say, called as

90
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:45,120
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

91
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:47,868
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

92
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,728
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

93
00:06:56,045 --> 00:07:01,849
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

94
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:07,855
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

95
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,791
is to be maintained.

96
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,442
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

97
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,885
not necessary.

98
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,795
But you are born, because if you are

99
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:22,842
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

100
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,321
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:33,718
Very important, that we should try to develop this

102
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:39,498
situation that brothers and sisters

103
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:44,784
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

104
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:50,318
And they should not be at all challenged.

105
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:54,247
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

106
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:59,534
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

107
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:04,766
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

108
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:08,955
is the relationship with God as a brother

109
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,759
or with a Goddess as a sister.

110
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,077
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

111
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,775
born to Nand

112
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,470
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

113
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,415
So there was an exchange that took place.

114
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:35,253
They had to replace Her in His place.

115
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,213
And then when Kamsa,

116
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:47,297
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

117
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:49,556
She went into the sky

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,653
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

119
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:59,257
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

120
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,997
is representative of that power,

121
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:08,235
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

122
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,975
towards women are good and strong,

123
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:17,544
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

124
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,948
It has many other qualities.

125
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,195
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

126
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,948
is a very confident person.

127
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,524
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

128
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,198
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

129
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,213
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

130
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:51,791
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

131
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:56,054
or to cut down something or to be against something,

132
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,603
then it has the power to crash

133
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:06,502
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

134
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:11,058
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

135
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:15,204
 is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

136
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:20,515
When He stood up and said that

137
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:26,814
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

138
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,743
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

139
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,299
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

140
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:42,818
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

141
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:45,857
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

142
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:50,368
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

143
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:57,558
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

144
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:01,562
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

145
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,484
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

146
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:14,489
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

147
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:20,473
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

148
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,551
Her chastity.

149
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:27,293
Now people,

150
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:33,732
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

151
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,406
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

152
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:42,476
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

153
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:46,162
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

154
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,925
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

155
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,834
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

156
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:59,472
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

157
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:03,687
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

158
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,427
These relationships are established, is wrong.

159
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,047
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

160
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:16,403
and playing these games of romance and all that.

161
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,409
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

162
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,092
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

163
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,557
There are some people who are just like

164
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:28,922
barbers, who try to organize marriages

165
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,498
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

166
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,831
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

167
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,948
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

168
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:44,473
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

169
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,337
When the marriage time comes,

170
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,287
it takes place.

171
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,015
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

172
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:58,240
a big question arose, because there were very few man

173
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,073
many ladies of all age groups.

174
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,761
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

175
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,723
because so many men died in the war.

176
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:12,842
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

177
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,294
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

178
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,721
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

179
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:23,711
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

180
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,801
Because if you have to

181
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:30,398
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

182
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,898
not without marriage.

183
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,079
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

184
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,909
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

185
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:42,412
And that is why He was particular

186
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,878
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

187
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,310
without marriage, was sin.

188
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:51,895
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

189
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,198
is there right to marry five persons.

190
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,611
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

191
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,388
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

192
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:06,250
And at that time the relationship between

193
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:10,481
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

194
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,329
because there was a big problem.

195
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,976
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

196
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,259
but cousins could marry,” that time.

197
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,366
Now that time is changed, all right,

198
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,961
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

199
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:31,820
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

200
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
So let us develop now our

201
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,252
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

202
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:41,100
Actually, first time when we had this

203
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,048
this Diwali function, I asked people

204
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,548
to find one sister for yourself.

205
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,276
Every gentleman must have one sister,

206
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:57,975
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

207
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:03,983
that next time when we meet on another day called as

208
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,712
Rakhi Purnima,

209
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:11,490
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

210
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:15,223
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

211
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:19,698
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

212
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,291
I think tied it to Raulbai.

213
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,372
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

214
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:30,260
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

215
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,171
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

216
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:39,343
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

217
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:41,511
And next year I think Raulbai

218
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,946
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

219
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,684
And she always carried on all that

220
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,925
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

221
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:56,838
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

222
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,338
so close and so pure.

223
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,569
And such a relationship one should develop

224
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,003
with a lady, any woman

225
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,692
or any friend you want to have.

226
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,131
One should remember that it cannot

227
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:17,809
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

228
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,663
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

229
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,296
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

230
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,986
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

231
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,715
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

232
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:32,785
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

233
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:36,671
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

234
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:39,756
Little further we’ll go with that

235
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:43,757
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

236
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:50,556
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

237
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,650
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

238
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:56,066
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

239
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,238
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

240
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:02,022
The other way round is for all the ladies,

241
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:14,970
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

242
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,330
are like sisters, elder sisters.

243
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,944
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

244
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:24,892
gives you a certain amount of understanding

245
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,564
how much distance is kept with whom,

246
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:30,143
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

247
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:33,375
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

248
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,325
that this purity is not corrupted.

249
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:42,485
You keep to pure standards. This is

250
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:46,037
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

251
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,294
of your growth, purity.

252
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,293
Purity is the most important thing for us,

253
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:59,729
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

254
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:08,595
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

255
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,392
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

256
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,622
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

257
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,655
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

258
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:23,964
or try to compromise with you.

259
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,876
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

260
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,741
You know that My name is purity.

261
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,213
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

262
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,188
it just purifies.

263
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:42,061
The purity should be such that it should purify,

264
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,859
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

265
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:51,330
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

266
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:56,298
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

267
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:59,406
I know some people, who even wash

268
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,906
the tap and also the water.

269
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,154
And that’s why, that’s why

270
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:12,643
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

271
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,184
water purifies us physically.

272
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:20,816
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

273
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,104
also by water. Water is a very great element

274
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:26,158
element in removing all problems.

275
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,489
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

276
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:36,377
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

277
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,457
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

278
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:43,845
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

279
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,918
So one has to understand that today’s message

280
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:56,948
is that we inculcate purity.

281
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:04,466
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

282
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,030
purity within ourselves

283
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:18,238
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

284
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:24,694
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

285
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:27,593
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

286
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,626
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

287
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:36,126
How do we like to have a bath

288
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:39,925
or to be clean and to be presentable?

289
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,820
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

290
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,423
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

291
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:52,292
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

292
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,435
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

293
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:03,973
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

294
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,473
aggression or of fear.

295
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,023
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

296
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,092
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

297
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:15,080
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

298
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,305
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

299
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:23,354
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

300
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:25,854
no need to have any fear of any kind.

301
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,147
If you have to have fear

302
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:31,177
that means there’s something wrong with you.

303
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:34,705
If you believe that God is above all,

304
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,628
you are a realized soul and that

305
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:40,128
God is going to look after you,

306
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:42,628
that He is your father,

307
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,869
that He’s open His gates to you,

308
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,887
what is there to be afraid of?

309
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:50,235
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

310
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:54,239
you are humble. Humility is different

311
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
from a frightened person.

312
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,851
It’s absolutely a egible thing

313
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,583
it has nothing to do with humility.

314
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,005
So to be humble is different

315
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:09,613
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

316
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,804
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

317
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:19,692
what is fear and what is humility.

318
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:24,800
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

319
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:34,644
So our purification of our mind

320
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:37,235
comes through certain methods

321
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,519
of understanding ourselves.

322
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,230
First of the understandings one has to have

323
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:59,173
is that we are born

324
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,923
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

325
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,567
religious sect or whatever it is.

326
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,630
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

327
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,681
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

328
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:23,560
So to keep it pure and simple is:

329
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:28,481
take to water element as much as you can.

330
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:34,756
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

331
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:42,802
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

332
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:45,302
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

333
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:49,772
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

334
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:54,233
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

335
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,733
Christ has said, “If you want

336
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,659
I can give you gold, gold parts,

337
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,381
you can live with it.

338
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,871
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

339
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,371
And I will eat with them,”

340
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,594
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

341
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,094
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

342
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:22,723
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

343
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,483
that they have to be with the pure people

344
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:30,093
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

345
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,692
that if you want Lakshmi,

346
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,123
you can have it, that’s money.

347
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:42,193
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

348
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:44,557
You’ve already got

349
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,129
your realization, you do not know how much you have got it already

350
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,682
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

351
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,796
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

352
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,714
Can I ask this question?

353
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,090
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

354
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,103
It’s all for the Spirit.

355
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:16,572
It’s all for the Spirit.

356
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,745
No, no. But you have a power.

357
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:24,730
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

358
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,843
The pleasure it gives you.

359
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:29,260
hmm?

360
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:30,880
The pleasure it gives you.

361
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:31,453
Beg your pardon?

362
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,038
The pleasure it gives you.

363
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,717
The pleasure?

364
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,258
Yes.

365
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,237
No, no, no.

366
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:37,337
The power of giving realization.

367
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,994
Go ahead still, little more, more.

368
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:44,487
Pleasure is not a power.

369
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:49,806
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

370
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,306
Sustaining power.

371
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,843
Sustaining power.

372
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:03,957
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

373
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:11,008
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

374
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:13,108
The power to spread Sahaja yoga Mother.

375
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,872
That’s rather vague, particular one.

376
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:19,029
Power to give realization.

377
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:24,126
To evolve Mother.

378
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,741
To evolve.

379
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:31,241
But to evolve is your own.

380
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,741
Power is what you do to others.

381
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:41,461
The whole thing I told you just now. Is to purify.

382
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:50,343
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

383
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:57,476
By purifying them. All right?

384
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:04,670
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

385
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,170
you can purify them.

386
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,717
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

387
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,590
you can purify them.

388
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,072
One person who is a realized soul,

389
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:24,894
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

390
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,394
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

391
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:36,672
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

392
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,267
You’ve awakened the light.

393
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,347
Now what other powers you have?

394
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:57,015
To raise the Kundalini.

395
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,610
That’s awakening.

396
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:02,811
See Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

397
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:07,958
You purify yourselves,

398
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,254
others and yourselves.

399
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,923
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

400
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,093
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them

401
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,812
 this is the best part of it.

402
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,249
You can’t follow it. Now let’s have it.

403
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,563
Power over time. Arranging time to suit yourselves Mother.

404
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,439
Power over time.

405
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:35,939
Arranging time to suit yourselves.

406
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:38,588
That’s not a power of Mahalakshmi.

407
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,234
That’s another one I’ll tell you who does that.

408
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:50,042
Balance.

409
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:59,347
It gives balance between ego and superego?

410
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,822
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

411
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,569
That is the guru’s power.

412
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:06,280
Balance comes from guru.

413
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:12,035
See Mahalakshmi is water, so now you tell Me.

414
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:15,200
To cleanse.

415
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,351
That’s done now, the cleansing is done. Water else water does?

416
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,973
Satisfied.

417
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,473
Now coming to the part.

418
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:33,040
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

419
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:37,825
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power,

420
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:40,325
because when you give realization

421
00:29:40,825 --> 00:29:43,203
that the seeking is over.

422
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:49,473
All right? Then another one now come along. What other powers?

423
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:54,621
Think of the water,

424
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,128
nourishment, you nourish.

425
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:08,463
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

426
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:11,337
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

427
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,587
Then dissolvement,

428
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,877
you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego.

429
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,610
All these powers you own after realization.

430
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:33,020
Just think of it. What else?

431
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,345
Divinity.

432
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:39,474
That’s very vague

433
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,603
because divinity

434
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:45,851
is how to relate it to water. People won’t understand it, so let us put it

435
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:48,585
other way round. What is it?

436
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,048
Cool down emotions.

437
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,526
To coll down emotions.

438
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:56,580
You become a cool down person

439
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,453
very good,

440
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:08,456
very good. You become cool,

441
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:15,223
cool personality. You have cooling effect, very good, water else.

442
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:18,515
You carry others. You can carry others.

443
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:21,684
You can, very gently

444
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,367
and also drown some of them.

445
00:31:29,285 --> 00:31:30,900
Drown into the love,

446
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,070
into the ocean of love.

447
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,356
But you can also push them

448
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:42,179
with two running jumps, all right. That also can be done.

449
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,366
It has another very great quality that water permeates

450
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,504
into the smallest particle. It goes the roots, I mean suck into the roots.

451
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,201
So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person. You just

452
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,796
know where the problem comes from,

453
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:03,359
you jump at it

454
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,427
actually it is the awareness, it is the intelligence,

455
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:12,661
suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened.

456
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:17,829
And you understand that now where is the problem, you just go near the root

457
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:23,127
and you suck and you can be easily sucked, you permeate.

458
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:27,001
You see, when you are sitting near a person

459
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:30,510
then you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

460
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:31,715
the person doesn’t know.”

461
00:32:33,106 --> 00:32:35,106
You have permeated. Your personality has

462
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:37,123
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

463
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:40,336
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots,

464
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,836
where is the problem.

465
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,336
The water is flowing into that being.

466
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,398
The divine water is flowing into that being

467
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:53,288
and the obstruction is felt through that divine water

468
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:57,104
and you can say that this is catching that is catching.

469
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:00,495
So permeate, permeating

470
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:03,340
and the another one is the glistening

471
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:10,924
of the water is so your glistening your skin becomes very radiant.

472
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,949
And the last of all is the reflection.

473
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,229
A person, who sees you,

474
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:25,068
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

475
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,533
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

476
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,102
I don’t mean anything

477
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:33,761
bad to anyone but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

478
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:36,293
because they see their reflection.

479
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:40,921
So when they reach you they see their reflection can be very aggressive

480
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:44,861
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

481
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,361
because they see their reflection

482
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:58,883
and if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of that person.

483
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,831
If you are clear-cut Sahaja yogi

484
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:10,872
you feel the depth clearly and they can see through - the spirit shines.

485
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:16,045
These are the qualities of water

486
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,805
within us.

487
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:25,363
The more of that I would say specially in My body

488
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:28,568
the water I actually buffer

489
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,068
to protect the charkas.

490
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,152
If I don’t have water in the body

491
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,070
I may have problems. So it acts as buffer

492
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,243
also it soothes your

493
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,732
epidermal cells; you can say it soothes your blindness.

494
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:50,222
You see, if there is no moisture /?/ blindness/dryness in all that.

495
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,801
It soothes everyone

496
00:34:56,968 --> 00:35:02,489
and there are other types of powers of water, which we know of

497
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,989
when it comes out of your eyes

498
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,407
it expresses your compassion,

499
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,645
your love, your emotions.

500
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,385
That is the only thing

501
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:21,491
out of all the elements which expresses emotions,

502
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:27,481
water power /?/.

503
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:34,205
Water has other qualities also which physics people know hydrostatics

504
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:37,155
it has the pressure.

505
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,205
It has the pressure

506
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,525
and a person who exists

507
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:43,336
like a Sahaja yogi

508
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:47,888
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not, he will not

509
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:51,272
aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

510
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:55,767
And another person if he receives one then he

511
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:59,346
will gets the advantage of you, but if he doesn’t want to receive it

512
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:04,265
then he feel pressurize and feels little bit dominated.

513
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,664
Your neibhours, your family people

514
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:10,440
at the beginning they feel a pressure because

515
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,173
the body achieves a kind of a weight

516
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:19,355
and that’s how the Guru Tattwa is formed out of you.

517
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:23,503
And if there is salt

518
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:27,835
that's Guru Principle then the weight is even more.

519
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,828
So today for water should really

520
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:39,594
know that the water is a very holy thing

521
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:42,918
and in our pujas also we use

522
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,445
specially this thing dignifies

523
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:52,609
the Kundalini that means the Kundalini is the water jar

524
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:59,302
or the carrier of Aquarius. And this is the age of the Aquarius. So how

525
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:04,812
important is this water and the water is the carrier

526
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:12,336
of divine love, is the best carrier. And this is the time

527
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:17,164
of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

528
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,689
So the whole idea of celebrating

529
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:33,107
today the Lakshmi’s day is to understand that in us

530
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:38,075
She has become the Mahalakshmi. By that we have so many powers

531
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,598
of which we are not aware, I mean we do not

532
00:37:40,694 --> 00:37:43,397
know also that we are realized souls. Some of us, we do not know

533
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:46,977
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

534
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:49,887
We can project our personalities to others.

535
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,099
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

536
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:57,139
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves, we can go into -

537
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:03,487
our permeation is like water is moving, is flowing all the time. And this

538
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:07,904
is a very important thing that we should be aware

539
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:09,469
of: our powers that we have achieved.

540
00:38:09,796 --> 00:38:13,470
Then we will start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

541
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,551
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

542
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:18,862
and everything comes with in when we become aware

543
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:23,827
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

544
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:28,518
of our dignity.

545
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:32,892
So it gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

546
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,498
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

547
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:42,145
We should have also the idea of human dignity

548
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:45,407
that we cannot insult human dignity,

549
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:53,229
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

550
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:56,807
or all the time asserting themselves about

551
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,435
something making everybody’s life miserable.

552
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:03,643
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

553
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:08,904
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

554
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:12,961
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

555
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,636
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

556
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:18,651
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

557
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:21,756
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

558
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,419
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

559
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,642
the human dignity is the most important thing.

560
00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:29,142
Must respect the human dignity.

561
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:32,540
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

562
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,163
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

563
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,959
because you are dignified now.

564
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:41,683
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

565
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,183
For small, small things we insult others

566
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:47,637
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

567
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,807
And the another side coud be that others

568
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:54,322
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

569
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,822
The both things are wrong.

570
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:02,909
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

571
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,857
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

572
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:11,145
and then the trust is grown

573
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:12,826
and one should keep the trust.

574
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,968
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

575
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:18,468
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

576
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:23,029
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

577
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:25,529
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

578
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:27,683
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

579
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:33,370
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

580
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,956
each one of you

581
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,032
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

582
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:45,244
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

583
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,724
And specially your Mother,

584
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:51,051
you can’t take liberties with Her.

585
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,301
That is something one has to know

586
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:58,959
in the west is important. This is very important

587
00:40:59,632 --> 00:41:01,632
that one has to know about it.

588
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,882
The other day I was correcting somebody.

589
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,382
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

590
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,341
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

591
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:11,495
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

592
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:16,222
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

593
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:20,573
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

594
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:25,254
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

595
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:31,604
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

596
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:34,104
cannot come up well.

597
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:36,143
So that is a very important point

598
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:40,971
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

599
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,838
or they come to - for example, today

600
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:46,650
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

601
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:48,104
they will wear a nice dress.

602
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:51,739
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

603
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,310
everything they will wear.

604
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:55,817
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

605
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:58,491
So one should not come with

606
00:41:58,703 --> 00:42:01,727
dishevel hair or things like that.

607
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:07,383
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

608
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,595
how you respect.

609
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:14,580
How you have to be dressed

610
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,077
how you have to presentable, because these things

611
00:42:17,173 --> 00:42:19,416
Some people say that oh /?/

612
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,916
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

613
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,416
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

614
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,989
It tidies everything you see.

615
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,144
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

616
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:32,059
concord, a complete,

617
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,973
beautiful music is created out of that.

618
00:42:35,473 --> 00:42:38,973
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

619
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:41,907
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

620
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:44,306
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

621
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,330
absolutely.

622
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:49,695
But you should not be other way round, that

623
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:52,434
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

624
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,115
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

625
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,620
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

626
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,637
for ego-oriented people

627
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:04,137
because they can become anything.

628
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,861
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

629
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,419
what sort of dresses people are wearing

630
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,578
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

631
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,370
That means you must be monkeys,

632
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,870
you wear such dresses and go about it.

633
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,838
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

634
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,400
there should be decorum about it.

635
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:33,712
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

636
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:37,808
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

637
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:41,694
is not so, that some people think that they become

638
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:45,438
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

639
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,284
You have to be decent person,

640
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:53,441
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

641
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:58,292
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

642
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:01,941
no hypocrisy. By doing any

643
00:44:02,095 --> 00:44:04,095
nonsensical thing,

644
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:06,962
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

645
00:44:07,174 --> 00:44:09,350
you will impress others. You will never impress,

646
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:11,562
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

647
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:15,591
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

648
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:19,486
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

649
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:23,530
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

650
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,768
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

651
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:32,280
and that’s how we should be pure

652
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:35,299
transparent, honest,

653
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:37,991
within ourselves we should be honest,

654
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:41,184
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

655
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:43,972
We put anything to the water it will show.

656
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:47,222
Put any color into it, it will show.

657
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:49,722
Put any mud it will show.

658
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:52,528
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

659
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:56,628
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

660
00:44:57,128 --> 00:45:01,882
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

661
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:04,089
but very beautifully enlightened

662
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:06,589
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

663
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:08,628
is enlightenment in our awareness.

664
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:11,593
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

665
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,689
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

666
00:45:14,593 --> 00:45:17,632
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

667
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:23,275
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

668
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:25,775
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

669
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:29,215
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

670
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:30,598
should not be there.

671
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:39,721
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

672
00:45:40,855 --> 00:45:44,555
what do you call lakshanas,

673
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:48,686
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

674
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:53,898
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

675
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,717
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

676
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,448
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

677
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,854
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

678
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:05,966
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

679
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:09,700
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

680
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:14,854
Then he should be cool personality.

681
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:19,626
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

682
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,612
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

683
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:26,845
I have seen people, you see, here

684
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:29,691
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

685
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,906
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

686
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:37,121
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

687
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:39,852
We have ways to beat them

688
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,217
but you are not to beat them back.

689
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,236
You are not to resist them,

690
00:46:46,448 --> 00:46:50,400
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

691
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,383
even with your tongue. Some people are

692
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:55,479
more with the tongue provocating type.

693
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,891
You must know that you must correct all these points.

694
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:03,373
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

695
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:05,873
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

696
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,160
So we have to dedicate ourselves

697
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,905
to our purification,

698
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,937
to our glorification because water glorifies,

699
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:20,437
gives you glory.

700
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,856
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

701
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,776
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

702
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,271
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

703
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:35,024
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

704
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:40,603
It has already come but it should be inside also.

705
00:47:41,968 --> 00:47:45,011
And that person who is a realized soul

706
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,566
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

707
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:50,354
people just know that he is realized soul.

708
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:55,355
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

709
00:47:57,989 --> 00:47:59,989
So many points we have covered today.

710
00:48:00,316 --> 00:48:02,316
I hope you will

711
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:03,829
again listen to them because,

712
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:07,319
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

713
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:12,072
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

714
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:14,341
I hope you people will take these tapes

715
00:48:14,437 --> 00:48:17,703
and listen to them everyday one by one

716
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:20,991
and also act, not planning

717
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:25,197
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

718
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,600
That’s how we are all going to mature

719
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:33,128
beautiful children. I’m just counting

720
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:39,481
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

721
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:45,326
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

722
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:48,704
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

723
00:48:49,204 --> 00:48:51,841
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

724
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:56,969
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

725
00:48:57,797 --> 00:48:59,797
May God bless you!
