1
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:26,924
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna Puja.
I went to America and they wanted Me to have

2
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:35,454
a Mahakali Puja. But I said, “No, let Me
talk about Krishna only.” Because we have

3
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:48,418
to first realize what is the strength of this
Puja, how are we going to establish Shri Krishna

4
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:50,156
within ourselves.

5
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:57,425
He Himself has said that “Whenever there
is a downfall of dharma.” Dharma doesn’t

6
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:10,287
mean what we understand as Hinduism, Christianity
or Islamic nonsense - it is not. Dharma means

7
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:23,080
our primordial taboos that are built-in, in
the human beings. About these, I think aboriginals

8
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:32,041
knew better than we. But then what we did,
we dominated them and also they had to change

9
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:44,071
their style of life. The primordial taboos
are only understood if people are trying to

10
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:51,840
understand oneself or else whatever has come
to them through tradition.

11
00:11:51,865 --> 00:12:02,490
Now, sahaj dharma is little bit different
in the sense that it’s much higher than

12
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:12,680
the sahaj ideas that we talk of, but it’s
much higher than even what Shri Krishna said

13
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:21,830
or Shri Rama said. First, Shri Rama thought,
best is to give them disciplines. People should

14
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:32,230
be serious about life, have full idea about
their own being, they should respect themselves.

15
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:42,411
All these things were written down long time
back. Also, people, basically when they were

16
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:50,520
good people, they understood that whatever
is bad for us, we should not do. These are

17
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:53,206
primordial taboos.

18
00:12:53,231 --> 00:13:02,516
Now, these primordial taboos are built in
within us. Now, supposing I say, “Don’t

19
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:10,986
drink.” You will go and drink. If I say,
“Don’t tell lies,” you will tell lies.

20
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:17,442
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo, because they think

21
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:25,236
now they have freedom, freedom to do what
they like. You are free people. Actually they

22
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:36,947
are not. They are under the spell of all the
kinds of allurement, you can call it, or temptations

23
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:50,495
which are against human life. And it’s very
natural to be a person of dharma. Small children

24
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,400
mostly have it.

25
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,600
For example, I’ve seen children, they feel
very shy to take out their clothes - even

26
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,320
small, small boys, I’ve seen. They won’t
take out their clothes in the presence of

27
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:14,581
others; they feel shy. So, all these are described
like, Ya Devi, Sarva Butheshu, Lajja Rupena

28
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:25,735
Samsthita. So, you should be shy; you should
be humble and respect your body, it’s very

29
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,550
important in these modern times. Exposure
of body is regarded as a great achievement

30
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:39,550
of women. They are trying to become aboriginals,
you see. That time they never had these ideas

31
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,040
and they were not so confused, you see. So,
even if their women were scantily dressed,

32
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:53,492
it didn’t mean that it was some sort of
a sex or some sort of an attraction for men,

33
00:14:53,624 --> 00:15:02,655
or men behaving in funny manners to show that
they have a special attraction for women.

34
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:13,294
I mean, why should you? It is absolutely absurd
that men should be attracted to women and

35
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:19,399
women should be attracted to men - and on
the road, on the street, you go, you see,

36
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:28,354
just that going on! This adharma is the worst
I think, for it’s a curse. Because after

37
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,699
coming to Sahaja Yoga also people start doing
this nonsense, you know. They should all go

38
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:38,629
to lunatic asylum, I think, they are no good
for Sahaja Yoga. But dharma gets established

39
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,779
as soon as you have the light of the spirit.

40
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:56,484
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put down
A, B, C, D, E, F. At the time of Moses, also

41
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:06,944
He had to put down Ten Commandments. But Krishna
thought the other way round - to establish

42
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:19,854
a dharma of pure love - pure love. So, because
He wanted that Shri Rama’s taboos were forced

43
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:28,664
on people, just like Islamic, just like Christians
- never works. So, He thought better to ask

44
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:38,814
them in their freedom, they must develop pure
love. Radha, who was with Him as His power,

45
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,839
is called as Alladhadayini. She’s the one
who gives joy - pure joy!

46
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:59,246
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble. Now, drinking is against

47
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:05,347
you, you know that. Today they are talking
about tobacco, tomorrow they’ll talk of

48
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:10,746
drinking when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

49
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:20,636
Then they will taboo it. But it’s a natural
taboo for your body. If you do something all

50
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:27,961
the time which is not good for you, for your
good life, you are becoming adharma.

51
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:44,989
This is to be understood very clearly that
the sahaja dharma is that you are just free

52
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:53,081
- complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense. You’re above it. You’re above.

53
00:17:53,106 --> 00:18:03,288
This sahaj dharma is above the dharma established
by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama, because you

54
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:12,368
have reached that stage. Is in complete freedom
you have to be dharmic. Whatever is not good

55
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:20,748
for you, you should not do. I don’t have
to tell you that you don’t do this or you

56
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:27,773
don’t do that. Whatever I say may not be
acceptable, but immediately your vibrations

57
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,223
will tell you.

58
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:36,563
This is sahaj dharma. In the sahaj dharma
you get rid of all kinds of, as they say:

59
00:18:36,581 --> 00:19:00,424
kaama, krodha, mada, matsa, lobha, moha. Means:
lust, anger, attractions, then greed. Greed

60
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:12,020
- that’s very important, greed. Greed. And
attractions. Now, if you understand how people

61
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:23,621
are greedy, greedy for what? This America
is dying of consumerism, you see. Now, see

62
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:31,291
the trick of the trade. In America, you can
borrow any amount of money from the bank,

63
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:40,251
no problem. Now, even if you don’t borrow,
they’ll send you a letter, “Why don’t

64
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:46,176
you take twenty thousand checks we are sending
you, why not have it? Ah, very rich you’ll

65
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:55,211
become, you see – it’s very nice to take
the loan.” I was told some people used to

66
00:19:55,236 --> 00:20:01,786
come to Ganapatipule after taking loans. I
said, “Stop that nonsense!” So they take

67
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:09,851
the loan and then they come to Ganapatipule.
All the time their mind is: ‘How will I

68
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:16,716
pay this loan, how will I manage?’ All the
time the attention is distracted, even when

69
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:22,606
you want to do something good to yourself
of coming to Ganapatipule.

70
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:34,461
So, such a mind is not free. The free mind
is that which has attention completely enlightened

71
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:46,641
by the spirit. But problem is we are still
rising out of this human bondage to a higher

72
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:58,691
life of realization. And when we are going
to that level, we have to realize that we

73
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:09,891
have to give up all these shackles, all these
horrible things within us. Like a bird, when

74
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:17,961
it is born out of the egg, shakes out all
the parts of the egg. Your brothers, your

75
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:27,961
sisters, your father, your mother, your husband.
Everybody - they try to put you down. Now,

76
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:32,686
if they are drinking, they’ll say, “Come
along, you better have something to drink,

77
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:39,686
you are not social, you are useless, you are
not up to date. What is this nonsense?”

78
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:49,601
That’s how a fashion starts and this collective
action of fashion didn’t come from Shri

79
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,386
Krishna and not in Sahaj.

80
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:58,646
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses. If you want, you can wear

81
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:11,081
a good dress, if you don’t want you need
not. You are free. You are free from money

82
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:16,856
bondage. This is very important. Money bondage
is another thing. I know some Sahaja Yogis

83
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:23,496
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make money
out of Sahaja Yoga. You came to Sahaja Yoga

84
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:29,175
for what? To get out of that money bondage.
In the sahaj dharma, to you money is nothing

85
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:34,625
but the dust of your feet. Nothing so important.

86
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:45,081
Then, we have such a collective sense of accepting
nonsense. That has to be dropped out, specially

87
00:22:45,106 --> 00:23:03,331
in America, I was surprised. Also in England.
A fellow came as a hippie. His hair were looking

88
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:12,341
like some monkey. Monkey is better I must
say. I don’t know like what, all put together

89
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:19,045
like a, you can say - there is nothing to
compare, I tell you.

90
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:22,375
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

91
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:28,525
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

92
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:33,456
I said, “But your brain is modern, what’s
the use of growing your hair like that? You

93
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:39,885
think you can become primitive? You cannot!”

94
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:49,801
Then afterwards I learned that he died. Another
one like that came and he didn’t die, but

95
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:56,713
went to lunatic asylum. Like that I met many,
but why do you do it? Because that’s the

96
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:58,966
fashion.

97
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:07,921
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers. Now there is a

98
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:14,875
joke about the ouveau riche people, in Russia especially.

99
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:22,558
Russians are not like that, normally. They
don’t accept something because it’s a

100
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:31,961
fashion.
So, one fellow said that “My God you lost

101
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:38,535
your hand in that accident!”
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very expensive

102
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:40,996
watch from Switzerland.”
“Really? What?”

103
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:48,821
“It was a Rolex.”
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone. The

104
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:55,246
Rolex is gone - Rolex is the fashion.

105
00:24:55,246 --> 00:24:59,316
So these are ouveau riche people who have money.

106
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:02,746
(Dog is on the stage)

107
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:09,746
Come along. Come along. Sit down. Sit down.
Now, go down.

108
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:22,649
They (the dogs) don’t form any fashions,
I have not seen dogs taken to any fashions.

109
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:30,410
Monkeys taking, I mean, supposing, you see
the Italian designers make something special

110
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:41,114
for them, they won’t think much of it. Maybe
their masters might buy, but not these animals.

111
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:46,537
Now, we don’t have to become animals of
course, but we don’t also have to become

112
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:47,914
slaves of fashions.

113
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,653
So there are some shops which are very expensive.
Why? Because they are designers. So you move

114
00:25:55,678 --> 00:26:01,931
about telling everybody, “See, I am wearing
this thing from a designer shop, this is from

115
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:08,931
designer shop.” That means, what about you?
You have no sense of designs; you have no

116
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:17,085
sense of understanding what you need and what
you don’t need. And nowadays most of them

117
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,520
are in jail also, sorry to say, but they have
money and they have made money by befooling

118
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,351
you.

119
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:32,426
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things which

120
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:37,610
were coming from Italy - designs, Italian
designs, written that Italian design so they

121
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:48,276
were buying it, Italian design. I was surprised
that such artistic things they create that

122
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:58,245
are available everywhere, such beautiful things.
But what they believe in is some sort of a

123
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:07,556
group madness, everybody wearing the same
kind of design is from this or that. This

124
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:12,500
is not sahaj dharma. You are not slaves of
anything. You are free people. You have not

125
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:19,975
to accept any design or anything. Ah, it is
there, is there! Let the stupid follow that.

126
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,890
We are Sahaja Yogis.

127
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:28,630
Now, this also prevails among people who are
supposed to be sadhus, they all dress up the

128
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:36,735
same way. How can you make out who is who?
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress

129
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,091
up the same way, look the same way, cut your
hair the same way. No. You have to be individuals,

130
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:51,686
because you are free, but that doesn’t mean
- freedom is always supported by wisdom - that

131
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:59,677
doesn’t mean that you do what you like.
All kinds of funny things happen when a person

132
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:08,046
doesn’t know what is the light of the spirit.
In the light of the spirit, you don’t get

133
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:15,418
involved into this kind of collective madness
that is going on. We are so collective in

134
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:21,220
mad things. I wish they could be collective
more in wise things.

135
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:28,220
Wisdom is very important, and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji - alladhadayini shakti

136
00:28:28,245 --> 00:28:38,286
- has to come within us. Means, when we meet
another person in the collectivity, another

137
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:49,745
person should feel happy with you. So He taught
the dharma of love. Love is not there if you

138
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:58,595
discard because he is black or because he
is brown, because he is white. It’s very

139
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:06,875
superficial - what is black, white and yellow?
I don’t understand. Here they go to the

140
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:14,720
sea shores to make themselves black and there
they say, “we don’t want to have any blacks,”

141
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:26,156
specially for Americans. I think this kind
of separation I found there, among the blacks

142
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,824
and the whites, I really wept.

143
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:35,664
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said, “Mother
will you go to Harlem?”

144
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:41,124
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
Me black, I’m black. If you call Me white,

145
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:44,134
I’m white. If you call Me yellow, I’m
yellow, so I’m going.”

146
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:48,375
And there I had a lecture, you know, so many
people were there, really I cannot forget.

147
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:58,199
It is one of the most famous place that there
is built in that hall and the same hall is

148
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:07,829
built in Australia where I had addressed many
people. I thought, just look at this! They

149
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:13,775
said, “Mother, the Australians copied from
us.” Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,

150
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:20,775
I tell you. I could see their heart, I could
feel it and the fellow was trying to compare,

151
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:25,574
after My lecture he just came, he hugged Me,
kissed Me. I mean, he would have even minced

152
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:34,623
Me, little boy about twenty-two years of age
- such love he felt. And he said, “Mother,

153
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:39,339
next time You come, You are going to come
to Harlem.” But I am told that hall is closed.

154
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:50,639
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy, not only against democracy

155
00:30:50,664 --> 00:31:02,230
but against what Abraham Lincoln wanted. They
had such a great man there and there is a

156
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:10,399
little street I saw in his name. Of course
in Washington they say they have some nice,

157
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:23,697
beautiful statues. But otherwise his principles
are finished; his ideals are finished because

158
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:33,141
somehow or other, some people came and wrote
against - England especially - against the

159
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:42,714
black people. What business they have to write
against something that is created by God?

160
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:49,924
If there are the same colors everywhere, they
all will look like military people. They have

161
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:56,170
to have different colors; they have to have
different hues. See, look at the trees; look

162
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:05,964
at the flowers. Look at the different hues
the sky has, just to make us happy – alladha.

163
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:14,804
What gives you happiness is variety. Variety
is a sign of beauty. If there is no variety,

164
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:22,405
it’s so boring I tell you, so very boring.
But they are very proud of it and they think

165
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:28,430
no end of themselves. They think they are
very great people; they have a sense of superiority,

166
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:36,094
because they have a certain type of nose or
maybe certain type of lips or maybe certain

167
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:42,680
types of hair. Such stupid things they are
and you join hands with them? How can you

168
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,530
join hands with them? You want your freedom?
Then be a free person. In the freedom you

169
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,369
have to have variety, very important.

170
00:32:54,369 --> 00:33:01,369
I would say that now the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America should have a new

171
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:10,279
style of drive; go to the black people. I
was very happy to see the South American seminar

172
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:18,135
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people. They went and met them. I have met

173
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,160
them also and I was so surprised that they
immediately said, “Mother, You are spiritual,

174
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,975
we know, but can You solve our problem?”

175
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,840
I said, “What’s your problem?”

176
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:36,489
“Very simple, we have a land – all right,
then - very little land, five, six acres of

177
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:44,476
land that belongs to us where the sage grows.”
Sage is a kind of a, according to them, is

178
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:51,976
a holy plant. All right. “Now, we always
meet, all of us, there for different festivals

179
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:57,652
because we regard that land as a holy land.”
They know so many things, you know. This is

180
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:04,632
a holy land; there were vibrations for that.
So they always used to meet, so natural.

181
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:08,632
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?

182
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:13,991
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

183
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,262
I said, “To an Indian?”

184
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:20,912
“Yes, so can you request this Indian to
return it to us, we’ll pay him the money.”

185
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:26,057
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

186
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:33,588
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi! He won’t leave you
even one single pai, is he going to give you

187
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:39,461
this? I’m sorry, I may be divine or I may
be anything, I can’t help you.”

188
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:45,111
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it. They should have raised voice.

189
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:49,871
They should have told the government, “Please
return their land. Why do you want to have

190
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:57,737
it? Why want to grab it?” As it is all the
Americans are immigrants. They don’t belong

191
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:05,404
to that place, that they were not owners of
that place, that ground - they are immigrants.

192
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:09,971
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that and then to think they are

193
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:14,951
superior. It’s very nice, somebody enters
your house and thinks he is very superior

194
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:18,971
and drives out all the people of the family.

195
00:35:18,971 --> 00:35:25,241
That is what has happened in America and just
opposite is sahaj dharma. With sahaj dharma,

196
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:36,086
you take people into your heart, you love
them. Your love flows all the time; your compassion

197
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:43,449
flows all the time. To Me it’s a problem,
this body is more compassionate than Myself.

198
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,032
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything. It wants to solve

199
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:56,010
the problem of others, but I don’t think
you can have that kind of a body, you shouldn’t

200
00:35:56,035 --> 00:36:00,181
have. But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

201
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:07,181
You see on the street somebody who is a dark
fellow. I like about the black Americans that

202
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:18,992
once I got down in one airport, so one gentleman,
black gentleman, “Hello darling, how are

203
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,941
You? How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

204
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:25,351
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

205
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:36,542
Then once I was traveling in - what was the
airport? Ursula was with Me. So he looked

206
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:45,532
at Me, one fellow, very tall, hefty, fat,
you know. He said, “Ah! Are You back again?”

207
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:49,504
I said, “I’m back. You know Me?”

208
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:56,746
“Of course, of course, I know you.” He
had never met Me, I had never known him. But

209
00:36:56,766 --> 00:37:04,638
I felt happy, I felt very happy. That’s
the best way to meet people.

210
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:10,704
Supposing you are walking on the street, you
see some black gentleman going. It’s a terrible

211
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:15,513
life there, I tell you; it’s a terrible
life for them. I’ve known, I’ve read books

212
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:21,793
on them, I’ve cried and wept and I felt
very sorry. So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should

213
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:27,853
just jump at them and you should say, “Hello,
how are you?” Shake hands with them. They

214
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:35,929
won’t cut your throat, I can tell you this.
In criminality, I don’t know who is more

215
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:41,643
criminal in America, whether they are the
blacks or the whites, competing. But, if you

216
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:47,793
are kind and if you are loving, you can remove
that part of criminality which is within them

217
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:51,983
because hatred can be only washed away by
pure love.

218
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:58,983
But people think they are very cunning, very
superior - in cunningness, of course. Otherwise,

219
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:08,153
what is their superiority? Only this complexion,
this white complexion is the worst of all.

220
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:16,113
I was very fair, very fair, till I got married,
or for some time, and then I started becoming

221
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:22,483
darker and darker. Because white complexion
gets all kinds of, see, the light you put

222
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:29,133
on Me, I absorb, I get a black spot. So it’s
not a very great thing to be white, I don’t

223
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:36,659
think so. It looks very funny and pale and
joyless. But no use going to the sea, making

224
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:47,488
your body, I think brown - brown, not so black,
brown and then suffering from cancer of the

225
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:53,093
skin. This kind of stupidity is also very
much fashionable.

226
00:38:53,093 --> 00:39:03,409
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get impressed
by these we should be on the watch. I saw

227
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:07,129
My granddaughter was wearing a sleeveless
dress.

228
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:10,374
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

229
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:13,323
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very
hot.”

230
00:39:13,323 --> 00:39:19,014
She’s young. I said, “But see, these are
two very important chakras. If you expose

231
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:27,016
them, then you’ll have problem.” She doesn’t
like to wear dresses which are above the knee,

232
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:29,536
but she says people wear even above the knee.

233
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:36,766
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them clothed, otherwise

234
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,764
if they are affected, we’ll have knee trouble.”

235
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:46,305
Immediately she changed, immediately. “Mother,
I’ll wear blouse from inside and something

236
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:54,560
from outside.” Immediately. Because she
knew this is a natural primordial taboo that

237
00:39:54,585 --> 00:40:05,993
we should not expose ours - these two chakras
and these chakras. But, nowadays, the more

238
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:14,889
you have long legs, I don’t know, they have
shorter clothes. And I don’t understand

239
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:21,914
what is in the legs, the whole beauty is in
the legs or what?

240
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:29,380
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with
Me. She was wearing a burqa because she was

241
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:37,065
a Muslim. And by the time we landed in London,
she took out the burqa and the dress was much

242
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:47,669
above the knees. I said, “What kind of Muslim
woman is she? She’s worse than even Christians

243
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:53,460
because they wouldn’t wear such a thing,
you know, to come out of the aeroplane, you

244
00:40:53,474 --> 00:41:00,474
have to come down on the staircase.” No
lajja, no shame, nothing, shamelessness!

245
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:11,608
So, sahaj dharma is that you have shame, you
have sense of shame. What you talk to others,

246
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:18,633
what you say to others, how you behave towards
them, in the sahaj dharma is alladhadayini.

247
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:28,081
If something is not alladhadayini, keep quiet.
Don’t say. What is the need? What is there

248
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:40,257
to be sarcastic? Showing off your brains in
your sarcasm. It’s not a sign of good breeding

249
00:41:40,282 --> 00:41:47,883
that you talk sarcastically to others in a
sharp way. But if you talk sweetly, what’s

250
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:58,408
the harm? This sweetness comes from Radhaji.
Now, of course they have misused Her and made

251
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:05,433
Her into a sort of a Romeo-Juliet business.
It was not that. She was a very pure woman

252
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:17,009
and She was Mahalakshmi. So, to be a Mahalaksmi,
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

253
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:25,049
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly all right. Once I remember, I was

254
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:35,410
in a big party and one gentleman came and
he sat down, “Aaaaaah!”

255
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,115
I said, “What happened?”

256
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:45,115
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You. See these women, I’m fed up.

257
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:49,732
But You came, I felt such a relief.”

258
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:53,071
I said, “What is so relieving?”

259
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,662
“You are so serene.”

260
00:42:55,662 --> 00:43:05,647
So, women are serene in sahaj dharma. They
are not stupid, frivolous, laughing at anything.

261
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:14,832
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh. I mean, there is

262
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:19,361
something laughable, all right, but some things
are not even laughable, they'll laugh. That’s

263
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:28,147
not the way. That can be ridiculous also,
can ridicule others. But laugh of appreciation,

264
00:43:28,412 --> 00:43:38,856
laugh of enjoyment, is so pure and creates
such beautiful atmosphere. I think the whole

265
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:50,064
ecological problem is in our brains – [Hindi
words]. It is not outside. It is inside us,

266
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:52,172
which is reflected outside.

267
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:58,752
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

268
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:07,836
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts to our behavior, to how we live. In

269
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:14,861
the sahaj dharma, you give up lust and greed
very easily, that I know. I mean if they can’t

270
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:20,732
even give up that, then they should not call
themselves Sahaja yogis. The first thing you

271
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:29,117
give up is lust and greed. I find it among
young people now, that those who come to Sahaja

272
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:40,407
Yoga become really very free people. They
don’t run after women. Women don’t run

273
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:47,262
after men. They are together, they sit together,
talk together, laugh together, but it is purity

274
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:57,255
that is here. In the Koran it’s described
that “When Kiyama will come, beautiful women

275
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,831
and beautiful men will be there, but they’ll
have no lust and greed, they’ll be pure.”

276
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:14,511
Is today, you can see that that lust and greed
is finished in most of it, most of you. Automatically

277
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:22,022
it is finished and now you can see for yourself
that you’re free of this bondage.

278
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:42,084
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow. In
the sahaj dharma, first thing is very important

279
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:49,382
is forgiveness. If somebody cannot forgive,
then he cannot be a Sahaja yogi. Forgiveness.

280
00:45:51,271 --> 00:46:01,544
How this forgiveness comes in is by forgetting
the past. Otherwise you’ll go on saying,

281
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:07,982
“This person tortured me, that person tortured
me, he was very mean to me, he was that to

282
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:14,982
me, he did this to me.” Shows that you are
not of that caliber to understand Sahaja Yoga

283
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:21,412
- because you cannot forgive. What is there
to remember? The present is the best. Now

284
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:27,702
if you are sitting here with Me, enjoying
the alladhadayini shakti, that time if you

285
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:36,836
are thinking about the past, shows what? That
you are not of the caliber. To be the caliber

286
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:44,313
of Sahaja Yoga, you should be free of your
past. Finished. There's no need to confess.

287
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:51,338
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to Me of confessions and I just said,

288
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:57,212
“Baba, just burn these letters. I don’t
remember. I don’t want to read anything

289
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:58,327
about anything.”

290
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:04,242
So, there should be forgiveness. If there
is forgiveness, you’ll be surprised, you’ll

291
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:10,591
feel very relieved and your married life will
be very happy. But if you try to remember

292
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:17,111
something – all right, some marriages are
really, really very difficult, all right,

293
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:24,111
so you get out. In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed
complete divorce, but must be with some reason,

294
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,672
not because you think something is superior.

295
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:33,642
Now we have banned many countries from where
we don’t want to have girls or from where

296
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:38,912
we don’t want to have boys. What is the
reason? With experience we have learned, they

297
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:51,967
are not marriage substance. Now, then better
not marry, and if you marry then live like

298
00:47:51,992 --> 00:48:01,026
an ideal Sahaja Yogi. Also, if you are a Sahaja
Yogini, then you can carry on very much better

299
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:03,992
by forgiving all the time.

300
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:11,177
Every time, when people tell Me, “My Mother,
You see You must help me.”

301
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:11,652
“Why?”

302
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:14,371
“Because, You know my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

303
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:18,871
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind. He
must give you money. Why doesn’t he give

304
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:19,772
you money?”

305
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:24,922
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say, “Mother,
she’s very extravagant.”

306
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:30,922
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

307
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:38,846
In sahaj dharma, the husband-wife’s relation
should be really romantic, should be really

308
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:45,321
beautiful. It is not, you know, we talk of
love and all that here, very rarely people

309
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:51,311
fall in love and carry on with it. It’s
a blessing if you really get that kind of

310
00:48:51,311 --> 00:49:02,457
a feeling. But mostly it is a curse. So to
fall in love is very good but that doesn’t

311
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:09,956
mean you forget that you are a Sahaja Yogi.
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,

312
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:17,061
in your married life. Same dharma is for your
children, that you bring up your children

313
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:25,596
not troubling them too much, but into a free
land. Let them use their wisdom. Sometimes

314
00:49:25,621 --> 00:49:31,222
I know children go astray and try to follow
wrong things. Then you must correct them,

315
00:49:31,222 --> 00:49:37,452
you must tell them, it’s your duty. They
were not born out of the trees but they were

316
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:43,242
born here, from the parents. So it’s the
duty of the parents to tell them that this

317
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:49,462
is wrong and this should not be done. It’s
a very wrong thing, you should correct them

318
00:49:49,462 --> 00:49:54,121
and that correction should be in a Sahaj way.

319
00:49:54,121 --> 00:50:08,046
I’ll tell you an example. I had a problem
once with somebody coming to Me and saying,

320
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:13,094
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

321
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:20,115
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi, because smoking Sahaja Yogi

322
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:25,506
is a funny caricature, you know, I can’t
think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking. How will I

323
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:27,615
look if I start smoking like that?”

324
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:30,420
“Ah, horrible.”

325
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:36,896
I said, “Then if you are My son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.” He gave up smoking,

326
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,920
can you imagine?

327
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:47,155
So, dealing with children, always make yourself
an example, yourself part and parcel of that

328
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:59,776
event. So the children don’t feel, you know.
This is something that I have talked many

329
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:07,885
a times. Children is one thing, I tell you,
they can give up everything but not your love.

330
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:18,691
If they know you love them they will not accept
anything that will make you not love - not

331
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:28,515
love them. This is for definite, because children
are the best people who know about love.

332
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:33,727
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that in
English language, I didn’t see many books

333
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:41,071
about children written beautiful, beautiful
things. There was one book that was published

334
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:47,357
when I was in London: The children talking
about the politicians, and they published

335
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:53,627
I think, 5000 books and that very same day
it was finished. So, talk to children, talk

336
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:59,727
to them. You’ll be amazed, they are full
of honey. They have such nice, nice things

337
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:07,388
with them and when they talk like that, then
you are amazed how they say things, how they

338
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:15,751
talk of Sahaj, how they are expressing their
spiritual strength.

339
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:30,722
Now, we have many very good children and also
they are absolutely Sahaj. One boy came and

340
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,197
he just prostrated himself before Me.

341
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:36,377
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

342
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:43,351
“No, I was getting cool vibrations, Mother
from You, so I did it.”

343
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,687
“Is it, you like it?”

344
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:46,743
“Of course!”

345
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,227
“More than chocolate?”

346
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:49,651
“Of course!”

347
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:55,045
I was surprised. “What? You eat them or
what?”

348
00:52:55,045 --> 00:53:03,169
“No need to eat, no, no, you feel so happy
inside and I feel, Mother, You are putting

349
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:06,815
Your hand on my heart and trying to console
me.”

350
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,704
Surprised. “And where is your heart?”

351
00:53:09,704 --> 00:53:17,869
He said, “Here, here is my heart, I feel
it here.” Just imagine, what love and what

352
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:23,095
understanding of Sahaja Yoga! For these little
children who are below even five years.

353
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:31,810
Now, you are all grown up children of Mine
and I want you to know all the beauties that

354
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:38,045
are within you, that you have to enjoy. First
of all, learn to laugh at yourself. That’s

355
00:53:38,045 --> 00:53:47,610
the best way to enjoy yourself, you know.
And not to spend much time on the mirror,

356
00:53:47,684 --> 00:53:52,874
in the mirror, that’s another way. You spend
too much on the mirror, then something wrong

357
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:57,555
with you. I think, personally, that it’s
a kind of a possession maybe. So, what you

358
00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:08,460
should see inside, “Are we sahaj dharmis?
Mother has established sahaj dharma, much

359
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:14,265
more than what Krishna wanted to establish.
He wanted to establish the dharma of love

360
00:54:14,265 --> 00:54:22,428
which of course we have, but apart from that
we have so many other beautiful facets and

361
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:29,839
such beautiful things within our personality
that we have forgotten to enjoy.”

362
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:40,803
So, the attention should be on your own qualities,
on your own personality, and then you’ll

363
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:48,940
be amazed how your personality is giving you
joy, giving you alladha, giving you so much

364
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:55,745
of patience with others.

365
00:54:55,745 --> 00:55:04,097
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke, because nothing so serious. It’s

366
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:10,449
not a Rama’s type that you have to be serious.
I don’t have to kill anybody. I don’t

367
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:17,826
use any weapons in this lifetime. Without
weapons if things are solved, what can you

368
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:19,088
do?

369
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:24,975
But you must try to see the beauty as Sahaja
Yogis. You should be sensitive to see how

370
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:33,962
you have been helped, how you have been guided,
how you have been blessed. This is sahaj dharma.

371
00:55:34,534 --> 00:55:40,425
If you cannot know that, then you live on
a very low level. I mean, it’s not fault

372
00:55:40,425 --> 00:55:49,512
of Sahaja Yoga, but it’s your style, you
are not sensitive. Supposing somebody is not

373
00:55:49,594 --> 00:55:59,829
- does not burn his hand. So what will you
do? He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,

374
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:07,670
he cannot feel. He can drink, he can smoke,
he can do everything and still he's existing,

375
00:56:07,774 --> 00:56:12,814
all right. Must be a rakshasa, I think or
I don’t know what to say.

376
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:21,988
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis and not from the bad ones and

377
00:56:22,305 --> 00:56:31,879
how do we proceed in enjoyment - which is
a ocean, just a ocean. For example, now, I

378
00:56:31,912 --> 00:56:38,625
came, everybody was trying to fan. But also
in the West another problem is they like to

379
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:44,495
live in hermetically-sealed rooms, hermetically-sealed
cars, they are very afraid of draft, I don’t

380
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:50,024
know, as if they’ll be blown away or what
will happen to them. They don’t want draft.

381
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:57,295
I mean draft is not coming from some iceberg.
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air

382
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:05,480
at all and that’s one other reason that
people are very suffocating sometimes, you

383
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:10,534
know, they just suffocate. They are used to
a suffocating life.

384
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:17,970
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so somebody
was driving Me, but the person who was there

385
00:57:17,995 --> 00:57:24,171
was from Western country. He said, “Don’t
open - don’t open the window.”

386
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:25,476
I said, “Why?”

387
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,756
“There’s a draft.”

388
00:57:26,756 --> 00:57:33,667
I said, “In this country, in India people
live in the open - what is a draft? What draft

389
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:38,647
you are talking about?” You can’t open
the door, you can’t open the window, you

390
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:44,627
can’t open anything, if you open anything,
they’ll be all dead, you see – as if.

391
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,936
So open yourself!

392
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:58,025
As it is about the nature, also it is in their
private lives. They don’t want to open.

393
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:03,751
If somebody comes to their house, “Oh my
God, now we’ll have to share the wines,

394
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:17,421
we’ll have to share the foods” They cannot
share. They cannot share. That is most uncollective.

395
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,201
But in India, I must say, people have a good
sharing capacity because they are still primitive,

396
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:39,374
they are still primordial, yet not gone out
of the way to satisfy their own ego. But I

397
00:58:39,399 --> 00:58:55,256
think somehow or other in India, people like
to share. If you want to please any Indian,

398
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,825
you tell them, tomorrow I’ll come and have
food with you. His wife will jump. She’ll

399
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:08,616
say, “Now what do you like, tell me, what
food do you like?” She will jump. But otherwise,

400
00:59:08,787 --> 00:59:14,348
what happens, as soon as you say he’s coming
for food, the wife will say, “No, no, I

401
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:27,707
am going to my mother.” Immediately she’ll
have a program. I just don’t understand.

402
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:34,183
They’ll have beautiful houses, very clean,
very beautiful, everything, but if somebody

403
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:43,371
comes to their house, they get a shock as
if electricity has entered. So, for whom is

404
00:59:43,472 --> 00:59:45,343
all this?

405
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:52,343
To show off, they will borrow money from the
banks. Even Indians in America they do. They

406
00:59:52,787 --> 01:00:02,168
want to have three Mercedes, four houses - for
what? Borrowing money with borrowing money

407
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:12,158
they live. Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow
any money. There’s no need, you can do away

408
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:20,477
with things. Why to have so many cars? Nowadays,
people don’t even walk at all. We used to

409
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:27,957
go to our school, My father had a car in India
- nothing doing. We had to walk. We used to

410
01:00:27,982 --> 01:00:34,933
climb one mountain. It was about five miles,
the school - every morning. Then in the night,

411
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:43,808
in the evening, the car used to come, and
I would walk with My bare feet, because so

412
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:50,833
much vibrations and on the chappals, I thought
were cutting my vibrations, so I used to have

413
01:00:51,222 --> 01:00:57,843
chappals in My hand and walk. One day we had
a new driver, My father sent him. He said,

414
01:00:57,843 --> 01:01:03,292
“How will I know who is the daughter.”
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in

415
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,593
Her hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

416
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:18,598
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity. It’s very important. And

417
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:23,833
not to side with anyone. You are not identified
with anyone.

418
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:30,193
It’s much better now, I think, because since
you have taken to sahaj dharma, I’ve seen

419
01:01:30,193 --> 01:01:34,532
English will tell you what’s wrong with
English. Swiss will tell you what’s wrong

420
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:39,183
with Swiss. Indians will tell you what’s
wrong with Indians. Actually, I learned from

421
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:43,742
them. I don’t know these things are there.
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with

422
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:53,787
Russians. They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us? Where do we lack in this?”

423
01:01:53,812 --> 01:02:03,892
Because the collectivity of being in one country,
say as an Indian, we see now, what’s happening

424
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:10,772
in India, all corrupt, horrible, this, that.
So, I said, “All right, if you don’t like

425
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:15,462
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”
No, no, no, that - we will stay here, but

426
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:21,712
this is a very corrupt government they are,
it’s very bad, this, that. Anywhere you

427
01:02:21,712 --> 01:02:31,707
go, you will find immediately they see - because
you don’t know they are now chosen to change

428
01:02:31,732 --> 01:02:33,552
their country.

429
01:02:33,552 --> 01:02:43,118
I’ve taken up many questions now, of India
and I’m going to start working on that level.

430
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:51,878
We've already started, in a way, for the destitute
women, then for other type of poverty and

431
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:57,883
all that. Just by saying, remove poverty,
poverty cannot be lost. You have to have feeling

432
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:04,883
for the poor, then only - but you get with
more that feeling because you are an Indian.

433
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:13,697
You are an Indian, so what? Your own brothers,
sisters starving. You get that very deep feeling

434
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:18,113
within you if you are a sahaj dharmi.

435
01:03:18,113 --> 01:03:24,093
So, this is the new dharma we have established
now in this world. A new race, with a new

436
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:33,257
dharma, which is much above - even Shri Krishna’s
vision is coming true. He describes in the

437
01:03:33,282 --> 01:03:39,552
beginning. I think, He was not a good salesman,
because He describes the best first. You see

438
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:47,200
the salesman first will start from two rupees,
then go onward to two thousand. But He first

439
01:03:47,292 --> 01:03:54,022
told us that you have to become Sthita Pragya,
means Sahaja Yogi - and then Shri Krishna

440
01:03:54,022 --> 01:04:00,752
was asked a question by Arjuna, “What is
a Sthita Pragya?” Then He describes a Sahaja

441
01:04:00,752 --> 01:04:08,898
Yogi, that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that, now. Then the questions

442
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:12,522
start. You know, Arjuna was a great questioner,
I think.

443
01:04:12,522 --> 01:04:17,007
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this and what about that and what about

444
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:18,042
that?”

445
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:25,898
So He goes on explaining to him that “You
see, this is all just a maya, this is all

446
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:33,497
an illusion you have. Get out of this illusion.
If once you get out of this illusion,” because

447
01:04:33,522 --> 01:04:40,042
Arjuna said, “They are my relations, they
are my teachers. How can I kill them?”

448
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:45,272
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are

449
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:51,643
being killed because they are not following
the satya dharma, so it’s all right. What

450
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:55,802
is your brother, what is your sister? They
are not following the satya dharma, so you

451
01:04:55,802 --> 01:05:00,486
have nothing to do with them. If you can correct
them and help them, it’s all right, otherwise

452
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:02,454
forget them.”

453
01:05:02,479 --> 01:05:09,937
First, deal with people who are straight.
Like we should say that we must deal with

454
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:17,207
people who are simple, innocent and then you
can take to difficult people when you are

455
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:21,383
that good. Otherwise you’ll come here saying,
“Mother, I have caught this, I have caught

456
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:29,178
that.” So, in sahaj dharma, you being the
spirit, you also know about others, very well

457
01:05:29,203 --> 01:05:34,492
and you can make it out, who is who, what
chakras they are catching.

458
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:45,450
But the trouble in America, I found that Sahaja
Yogis used to, just could go and tell somebody,

459
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:49,252
“You are catching on this chakra.” Now,
he has come for the first time and you tell

460
01:05:49,252 --> 01:05:50,782
him, “You, you are very egoistical.”

461
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:52,943
He says, “How do you know?”

462
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:56,572
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

463
01:05:56,572 --> 01:06:03,818
Is this the way to receive a new person? Is
this the way to talk to a new person? See,

464
01:06:03,843 --> 01:06:09,653
on the contrary, you should say, “Come,
sit down, very nice, you are very great,”

465
01:06:09,653 --> 01:06:16,679
see? Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of buttering, as you call it,

466
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:25,358
you see, we call it chaplusi. Then, gradually,
because you are doing this just to make him

467
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:30,883
a Sahaja Yogi, because you love him. Basically
that is the reason. But as soon as somebody

468
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:36,103
comes in, if you tell him, “This is wrong
with you, that’s wrong with you.” This

469
01:06:36,103 --> 01:06:43,259
is not a pope’s business where you go on
telling people what’s wrong with them, go

470
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:50,957
and confess to all these silly people. It’s
not that. What we have to show that you have

471
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:58,004
fallen in love with that person; you are nice
to that person because you like that person.

472
01:06:58,054 --> 01:07:04,304
Then gradually you pull him up. But as soon
as he comes you give him one shock, so finished.

473
01:07:04,304 --> 01:07:07,153
How can you have good relations?

474
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:11,143
Americans have to learn this. I don’t know
why Americans think they are very superior

475
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:18,898
people. I tell you for wisdom, I would not
say they are so good. It’s completely lacking

476
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:27,769
– wisdom in them. And they misunderstand
people very fast. Start judging others, is

477
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:34,794
not the way you can have sahaj dharma. Sahaj
dharma is: you are your own. You are in your

478
01:07:34,819 --> 01:07:38,799
own, you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy. Where is the time to criticize

479
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:41,219
others?

480
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:50,199
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone. In that love you should

481
01:07:50,224 --> 01:07:58,318
not show your pity, but love which is, again,
alladhadayini. This is the message of Shri

482
01:07:58,343 --> 01:08:02,883
Krishna, but I don’t know how many understood
it. Now, what you find those who are following

483
01:08:02,883 --> 01:08:11,479
Shri Krishna like Hare Rama people, they are
really beggars on the street. He is Kubera,

484
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:17,913
and his disciples are all beggars, can you
imagine? Does it add to His glory as a Kubera?

485
01:08:17,913 --> 01:08:27,717
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that. Should
be generous, should not bother too much about

486
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:36,239
yourself. Should not all the time think about
yourself, but think of the collectivity, how

487
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:47,709
you behave. Collectivity is not to bring - force
people to come to Sahaja Yoga. Once they come

488
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:53,014
to Sahaja Yoga they will know the joy of life
and you don’t have to tell them anything.

489
01:08:53,014 --> 01:09:00,014
Nothing has to be told, just silently it will
work and they will feel your love.

490
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:10,519
You see, love is something so great. It not
only helps others but it also helps you. It’s

491
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:16,744
so joyous to give realizations to others.
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra

492
01:09:16,744 --> 01:09:20,633
is catching”, why you are giving realization?
If you don’t know how to give realization,

493
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:31,658
better not do it. So, to criticize is not
the way we can enjoy love. Ah, of course you

494
01:09:31,683 --> 01:09:38,363
can pull legs of each other sometimes, just
for fun’s sake, but not to harm, not to

495
01:09:38,363 --> 01:09:47,538
torture, not to make that person fall. You
are all sahaj dharmis, you have accepted sahaj

496
01:09:47,563 --> 01:10:00,347
dharma and in sahaj dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart, not hypocrisy - and

497
01:10:00,372 --> 01:10:03,009
sensible life.

498
01:10:03,034 --> 01:10:11,348
Now, this pope is against abortion. I’m
not. If a woman is suffering, let her have

499
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:18,949
abortion. The one who is living is more important
than who are not living. If somebody wants

500
01:10:18,974 --> 01:10:27,002
to have abortion, that child can be born again.
According to us, nobody dies permanently.

501
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:32,204
Whatever it may be.

502
01:10:32,204 --> 01:10:42,788
So, this is one way they use it for propagation
of human beings. Like they say the Muslim

503
01:10:42,813 --> 01:10:48,054
women are like a factory. They go on producing
more children, more children, more children.

504
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:55,458
So there are more voters. So the pope knows
that. That’s why he says, abortion, no.

505
01:10:55,530 --> 01:11:02,404
Christians should not abort, because then
there will be less Christians to compete with

506
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:04,649
the Muslims.

507
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:14,660
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such funny,
radical, nonsensical things. We have divorce,

508
01:11:14,756 --> 01:11:26,223
and we have also abortion, which is important
to understand that these are all taboos which

509
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:36,725
are there. But not for people who have to
get out of the troubles - you have to have

510
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:43,986
it. And that’s how it works. But to be very
frank, we don’t have to do abortions, it

511
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:54,124
is achieved by Paramchaitanya. Paramchaitanya
does for Me. I don’t have to. I don’t

512
01:11:54,296 --> 01:11:58,670
have to do anything. It’s Paramchaitanya.
It’s nice, because it knows what is to be

513
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:04,845
done, how to achieve it. And sometimes you
are in trouble, then know that you are not

514
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:10,019
leaving things into the hands of the Paramchaitanya.
If you leave into the hands of Paramchaitanya

515
01:12:10,044 --> 01:12:13,872
things will work out very well.

516
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:20,193
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and foremost
thing is, how much you are enjoying yourself.

517
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:28,497
How much enjoyment you are giving to others?
For that you have music, you have this, that.

518
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:44,367
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna
you can’t keep quiet. He played murli, basuri,

519
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:56,285
flute. Look at Him. I talked to Him, but He
just played murli. He didn’t talk so much,

520
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:02,959
except for the Gita, you won’t find Him
talking. And those who read also Gita are

521
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:08,340
horrible people, I tell you, I have met - those
who read Gita. They don’t understand what

522
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:13,080
is Shri Krishna’s dharma is. If they don’t
understand Shri Krishna, how will they understand

523
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:29,633
Sahaja Yoga? So, for all of you is to practice
on love, on forgiveness, on appreciating others,

524
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:33,759
on giving joy to others.

525
01:13:33,759 --> 01:13:39,929
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind
to Me also. Once I went to the shop to buy

526
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:49,972
a sari for Myself and the sari was very expensive
for My purpose. So, I didn’t buy. Said,

527
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:56,130
“Let it be. This color suits Me, all right,
but doesn’t matter.” I didn’t have so

528
01:13:56,369 --> 01:14:03,341
much money to buy. So, that Sahaja Yogi bought
that sari and on My birthday gave Me - and

529
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:09,217
really, I could not see it, because My eyes
were filled with tears. Just a small thing

530
01:14:09,242 --> 01:14:18,279
like that. Normally I don’t expect you to
do anything for Me, no. But small, small things

531
01:14:18,331 --> 01:14:24,322
make you so happy. But even if you do this
to somebody, may not understand, may not realize,

532
01:14:24,347 --> 01:14:28,968
may not feel it. But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,
you will.

533
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:40,030
So thank you very much for all this that I
have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and

534
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:41,792
make others enjoy you.

535
01:14:41,817 --> 01:14:43,803
May God bless you!
