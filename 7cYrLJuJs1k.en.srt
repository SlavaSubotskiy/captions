1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:19,860
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It gives 
me immense pleasure to come to Cardiff again

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:30,530
for this programme of Sahaja Yoga. They must 
have explained to you what is Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:38,690
That is, ‘Saha’ is ‘with’ and ‘Ja’ 
is ‘born’–it is born with you and all

4
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:46,940
of us have a birth right to get this spontaneous 
yoga, that is the union with the Divine. Ascent

5
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:55,630
to the Divine is our birth right. Only thing 
we must reach that state of awareness where

6
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:10,569
we become aware of higher seeking within us. 
First as a human being we seek food, then

7
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:20,380
protection, house, possessions, money, power-and 
then we find that all these things even if

8
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,770
you have achieved you have not been able to 
achieve what you wanted-that is the state

9
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:38,490
of joy, and thus you start seeking furthermore 
to find out what should be that state in which

10
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,139
you remain in complete joy.

11
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:51,209
Many people have no idea as to what to expect 
and also they are quite naive about the structure

12
00:01:51,209 --> 00:02:00,409
or the nature of this tree of life which is 
built within us. Now what I’m going to tell

13
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:09,789
you is the Knowledge of the Roots. So far 
with our developments we only know the Knowledge

14
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:17,890
of the Tree, but we have to know the Knowledge 
of the Roots which sustains this tree. If

15
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:24,360
we do not know that Knowledge, it may be one 
day this great tree that we see which seems

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,410
to be quite secure, may completely be destroyed. 
So it is important for everyone to have that

17
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:40,760
Knowledge of the Roots within ourselves and 
within our society, within human beings as

18
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,670
a whole.

19
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,570
Now we have to realise that we have come to 
this state of human awareness up to a point

20
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:56,750
where we find we are lost. These days in the 
modern times, we are very much confused because

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,050
there are so many ideas afloat. All these 
ideas confuse us and we don’t know where

22
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,160
to look, what to see, the value systems have 
changed rapidly so drastically that it is

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,810
difficult for us to keep up and cope with 
it. Despite all that, it seems that there

24
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:25,010
must be some hope for us: after all God, God 
who has created this Universe must be worried

25
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,130
about this creation. After all, He has to 
do something about it. It’s no use only

26
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,850
our worrying about it, or being aware of the 
shocks, the future shocks that we may receive

27
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:50,610
because of the mistakes we have committed 
before. It is He who has made us and it is

28
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,660
He who works out everything for us. For example, 
we believe that we do this and we do that.

29
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:07,380
What we do is the work of the dead to the 
dead. We do not do any living work. We cannot

30
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:16,180
transform one flower into a fruit. But you 
see in different seasons we find different

31
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,020
types of flowers, different types of fruits 
coming in, we find every child that is born

32
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,210
has something to do with the society, with 
the parents, with the country where it is

33
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:37,529
born, it is such a big selection that it is 
impossible to find out who could have done

34
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:47,289
it with such tremendous powers of accuracy. 
A child is conceived in a Mother’s womb,

35
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:52,699
is a very big miracle itself to all the medical 
science because normally everything that is

36
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:59,580
foreign is thrown out of the body–but when 
the foetus is formed in the body, it is not

37
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,960
thrown out, on the contrary it is preserved, 
looked after, nourished and thrown out at

38
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,330
the time when it is fully matured. This is 
such a remarkable thing that we see everyday,

39
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,990
but somehow or other we take everything for 
granted.

40
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,689
Human beings if they look at themselves, they’ll 
be amazed how beautifully we are made. This

41
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:29,199
is something special about us. We know so 
many things more than the animals do. An animal

42
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,360
can pass through a dirty lane, he cannot understand 
any architecture, he cannot understand any

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:45,039
colours, any beauty, but we human beings have 
so many ideas and also abstract ideas. But

44
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,659
beyond this is a state where you reach into 
an absolute state-so far still we live in

45
00:05:53,659 --> 00:06:00,279
a relative world. Whatever we know is so relative 
that it is difficult to decide really what

46
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,529
is right and what is wrong. Relatively we 
can say alright, this is little right and

47
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:12,789
this is little wrong. But we cannot absolutely 
say that this is right and this is wrong.

48
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:20,879
Here then we start thinking-ate we really 
fully evolved? We are not. We are not evolved.

49
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,469
And when I say this you should take it as 
an hypothesis with a very open mind of a scientist.

50
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:33,029
And then if it is proved you have to accept 
it as a law, not before that.

51
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:42,289
It is very hard to believe that we can become 
the Spirit. This is one of the big myths of

52
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:49,729
modern times and many a times when I speak 
about becoming the Spirit people say that

53
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:58,199
-how can you say like that, how can it be 
that easy-but it is a living process of our

54
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,129
evolution and if it is done by the power. 
of a living God, then it has to be very simple,

55
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:12,499
has to be very easy-like if you have to sprout 
a seed You just Put it in the Mother Earth,

56
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:17,279
and the seed has a capacity to become the 
plant and the Mother Earth has a capacity

57
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:24,490
to sprout it. In the same way, this happening 
has to take place. Today that time has come.

58
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:31,770
That time has come, the time of judgement 
has come and at this time we have to see that

59
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,080
we’ll be judging ourselves, but not by some 
sort of a weight or some sort of an authority,

60
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,270
but by something which is within us which 
we call as the Kundalini:, is placed in the

61
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,289
triangular bone called as sacrum. Just see, 
Greeks knew about it, that’s why they called

62
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:55,419
this bone as sacrum. But what is this bone 
in the biblical understanding-it is the reflection

63
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:02,009
of the Holy Ghost. We have to understand that 
if there is a Father God and a Son-there has

64
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:07,909
to be a Mother. So this is the primordial 
Mother who is the Holy Ghost and She is reflected

65
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:17,089
within us as the Kundalini. In our heart is 
reflected the God Almighty. It is He who is

66
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:23,779
the witness of whatever we are doing. This 
power manifests everything within us and then

67
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:31,580
resides in a sleeping state in that triangular 
bone and is said to be residual because it

68
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:40,100
has not yet manifested itself. This is the 
power of our desire which is true and the

69
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:47,790
only desire we have which is pure. Because 
all other desires are not true. If they were

70
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,890
true, any one of them when satisfied, we would 
not have desired for anything else. But it

71
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,580
is not so as you know in economics that wants 
in general are not satiable. So you want to

72
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:07,820
have something today, then we want to have 
another thing tomorrow. But once the desire

73
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,390
of becoming one with the Divine manifests 
then you don’t want anything-you want to

74
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:22,930
give. Like you want to be the light and then 
you become the light that emits light and

75
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,230
emancipates others -raises them to the level 
of their Spirit by giving them peace and bliss.

76
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,180
Today we talk of peace. But how can we have 
peace with the people who are so disturbed.

77
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,560
We have to have transformation of human beings, 
who should feel peaceful within themselves

78
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,270
and should feel that they are the ones who 
are part and parcel of the whole. But this

79
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,350
should not be a conception or a mental projection. 
Because mental projection can disappear in

80
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,490
no time. Like you would believe that this 
particular person is my friend but you discover

81
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,570
that he is not and the whole mental projection 
drops out.

82
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,370
So all mental projections are artificial, 
they last for a short time and disappear.

83
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,860
But this is a happening that has to take place 
within us when we become the Spirit. It is

84
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,060
the question of you feeling that Spirit on 
your central nervous system. So in our evolutionary

85
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:25,300
process whatever happened to us has happened 
to our central nervous system, and that is

86
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,180
what Christ has exactly said when he said 
you are to be born again. He didn’t say

87
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,680
that you just ask somebody to do an exercise 
of putting some water on top of your head

88
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,480
and then say now you are baptised. No. There 
is a true baptism of the real awakening of

89
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,520
this Kundalini passing through these six centres 
above, piercing through your fontanel bone

90
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,040
area and giving you the true experience of 
the breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of

91
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,950
your own head and this cannot be by just putting 
water by somebody. It has to happen within

92
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,080
yourself and you have to seek the truth, and 
not something that just satisfies you for

93
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,800
the time being.

94
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,790
That’s why even if you profess any religion 
we find we don’t have much transformation

95
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:17,090
within. But here you become the Spirit, the 
fight of the Spirit we can say, on our central

96
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,910
nervous system just guides you. Like first 
of all when this Kundalini rises She passes

97
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:29,160
through these centres on the physical level 
and you get physical health. Some people say,

98
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,730
Mother, you heal us or cure us-is not true. 
It is your own Kundalini. It’s your own

99
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,930
Mother within you.

100
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:43,880
Everybody has an individual Mother, when She 
rises, She actually fulfils the need of every

101
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,840
subtle centre that supplies to your gross 
centres, because these are the abstract or

102
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,330
we can say are the subtle centres which are 
first fulfilled and they look after your plexuses,

103
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,350
that’s how you get heated automatically. 
It is you who heal yourself, not me. I’m

104
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,600
just a catalyst you can say, like one enlightened 
light can enlighten another one , and once

105
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,380
you are enlightened, you can enlighten another 
person. That is how it is. So there is no

106
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,340
obligation. There is no give and take. It’s 
like we are part and parcel of the whole.

107
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:27,350
Now we have, say, a problem on a finger. What 
do we do? We just rub that finger and find

108
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,180
that we feel better. But have we any way obliged 
this finger? Because it is part and parcel

109
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,500
of you it just spontaneously has happened 
and has worked out. In the same way it happens

110
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,760
to you also that you get this Realisation 
automatically.

111
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,310
Now the mass evolution has started and there 
are many who have got Realisation like that.

112
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:58,000
I’m happy to know in England also we have 
at least two to three thousand people who

113
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,040
are realised very well, who are established, 
but there may be much more who have got Realisation,

114
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,130
but then you have to establish yourself like 
a tree. Once you establish like a tree you

115
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,010
can give Realisation to others and you can 
give them peace and the whole thing is such

116
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,660
a transformed personality-because the second 
thing that happens to you when you become

117
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:26,570
the Spirit that you become so powerful that 
nothing dominates you. Nothing dominates you.

118
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,740
There is no habit that can dominate you. No 
temptation can dominate you and you become

119
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,360
very powerful, But at the same time you are 
extremely compassionate, you are extremely

120
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,880
kind, so it is a very compassionate power 
that you develop of the Spirit and you become

121
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,300
a new personality, a wonderful personality. 
We know when we have Christmas, when we have

122
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:57,360
Easter, we give eggs to people. This denotes 
the Resurrection of Christ as our own Resurrection,

123
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:05,010
that an egg has to become the bird. It is 
symbolic of that. That we are like eggs when

124
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,770
we are closed, when we have this ‘I ness 
within us, and then suddenly when this happens

125
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:17,840
to us, this egg becomes the bird and you become 
completely free and you know what freedom

126
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:27,700
is. Freedom is no licence but freedom which 
, is absolutely not curbing anybody’s freedom

127
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:35,100
nor is giving you any bondages. It is something 
so great it should happen to all of us.

128
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,560
We have had many great saints in this country, 
I would like to mention William Blake who

129
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,690
was a great saint and who saw all this happening 
Ion ‘time back, two hundred years back-and

130
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,740
He wrote about it that such and such time 
will come when men of God will become prophets

131
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,170
and these prophets will have powers to make 
others prophets. He has said so many things

132
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:09,340
that time has come today for England to rise 
as He has desired and described. That time

133
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:15,930
is here today now at this time you should 
get your Realisation-you’ll realise that

134
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:22,500
now you have entered into that Kingdom of 
God. We have also many people, we can say

135
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,280
even Mohammed Sahib has said that “At the 
time of Resurrection your hands will speak.”

136
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,460
Exactly this happens, that when you get your 
Realisation, when the Kundalini comes up,

137
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:41,550
and She touches the seat of God here immediately 
in your heart the reflection of God starts

138
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:49,900
emitting cool vibrations from your hands also. 
When it starts happening you are amazed that

139
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,560
all around you feel the subtle power. of God, 
the power of His love, what we call the all-pervading

140
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,750
Brahma, what we call the Chaitanya, that’s 
how you start feeling it and once you start

141
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:09,830
feeling it you are amazed that how you can 
find about anything. You become like a computer.

142
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,490
As soon as you want to find out whether it 
is right or wrong, say you want to ask a question,”

143
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,080
Is there God?”-Immediately you’ll find 
there will be cool breeze coming out. But

144
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,200
if You want to find about Hitler, you might 
get a blister or a heat on your hands and

145
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,600
you’ll feel horrible about it. So that is 
how you start working it out and gradually

146
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,990
you become absolutely wise in the sense you 
become absolute and you understand.

147
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,590
Just now if you look at a person how will 
you find out who is right and who is wrong?

148
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,279
But when this happens to you, you don’t 
have to know about him. On his centres you

149
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,610
know because you become collectively conscious. 
You become, again I say, it is a becoming,

150
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,460
You become collectively conscious, you can 
know about your own centres and you can know

151
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,730
about the centres of others. And when you 
feel the centres of others, you know what

152
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,770
the problem is, you don’t talk like other 
people talk, but you talk in the language

153
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,530
of centres. This is exactly what happened 
to the disciples of Christ when they were

154
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,370
blessed by the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze 
came on them, they started speaking in strange

155
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:22,370
languages. And the same thing you’ll find 
with Sahaja Yogis that they speak in a strange

156
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,660
language in the sense that they talk in the 
language of the centres, and they start using

157
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,190
their hands in a way because the hand has 
got the power flowing, and they use it to

158
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,930
bind it up and that looks very strange and 
at that time also it looked very strange so

159
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:42,160
people started saying that they are mad people, 
they are doing some sort of funny actions.

160
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,630
So all this happens, it’s very simple, has 
to happen, the time has come, it is the blossom

161
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:57,860
time; at that time I would say, in the early 
days, it was not the blossom time but it was

162
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,870
the time when there were hardly one or two 
flowers on the tree of life, but today is

163
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,380
different-there are so many seekers all over 
the world though misled by all kinds of things,

164
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:16,800
because as soon as they come to know, the 
negatives, that God has decided to work it

165
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,740
out, they have come in the market and they 
are selling their goods. One must know that

166
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:28,620
you cannot sell God in the market. Secondly 
you cannot organise God. But we are so much

167
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,680
used to it, paying for everything that we 
can’t understand that we can get something

168
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,309
without paying.

169
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:42,809
But think of a seed which we sow in the Mother 
Earth. What do we do? Do we pay anything?

170
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:48,300
Does it understand money? Do living processes 
understand money? Do you think God understands

171
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:56,820
money? You can’t pay for it. If you put 
this one small little test,-99 per cent of

172
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,809
these bogus people will disappear from the 
scene. But we don’t think, we don’t use

173
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,740
our brains, we go headlong into it. On the 
contrary they will ask thousands of questions

174
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,610
to me but to these people who have taken thousands 
of pounds and have finished them off they

175
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,840
don’t ask any question. They just go headlong 
into it, ruin their lives, get into epilepsies

176
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,840
and all kinds of diseases, then they come 
to me and I find that they are in a very bad

177
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,780
shape. But doesn’t matter, whatever has 
happened has happened. Nobody should feel

178
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,010
guilty about it. That’s one condition of 
Sahaja Yoga is that we should not feel guilty.

179
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,750
We have to be in the present.

180
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,330
Forget the past. We are not to think about 
the past. And at this present moment this

181
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,570
should happen to all of us.

182
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,420
Now the subject matter is so great and the 
knowledge is like an ocean, I cannot in this

183
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,510
short time tell you all about it, I would 
say there must be at least two thousand lectures

184
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:56,390
in English language which I have given all 
over the places, and I would request you first

185
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,400
of all to get the light within you.

186
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,550
Like this room when it is not lighted and 
if I tell you about this room it will be a

187
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,750
headache, and if I tell you about the electricity, 
the history of the electricity, the connections

188
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,309
of electricity, the sources of electricity, 
you’ll be fed up. First of all, let us have

189
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,440
the light. Once we have the fight it’s much 
easier to understand, and you’ll have much

190
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,140
patience. So I would request you first to 
have the light We can try it, I cannot guarantee,

191
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,520
I must say, I cannot guarantee to everyone-is 
something that works out but may not work

192
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,730
out also. As far as possible, we should try 
and let us see what happens to us and if it

193
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:49,330
works out that would be really a very great pleasure for me. May God bless you all.
