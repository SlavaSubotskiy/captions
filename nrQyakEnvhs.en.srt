1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:10,620
On this occasion when you are all leaving
me, is rather hard to listen to these qualities

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,850
described in your beautiful song.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:39,860
My words are so loaded with a feeling of extreme
sadness, plus the exuberance of new ventures,

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:54,350
some ideas that I have to do much more to
establish whatever you are describing me.

5
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,060
So many rakshasa are to be killed as you have
described Me.

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,191
All the disparities are to be removed from
this world.

7
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:11,630
All the ignorance, the darkness, the chimera
has to be removed, as you have described me.

8
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:25,341
It is very easy to destroy this world and
it was easier to destroy the demons and the

9
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:37,270
devils, but today the time is so precarious
that all these have entered into the brains,

10
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,329
the Sahastrara of many seekers.

11
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:54,889
So, it’s a very delicate task to remove
those horrible influences to save the seekers

12
00:01:54,889 --> 00:02:00,200
from the clutches of these devils.

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:11,970
You have been very kind to understand that
it is a very delicate thing and we cannot

14
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,740
do it with harshness, with bluntness, with
straightforward statements.

15
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:28,110
We have to take them round because there are
hard rocks and make them understand through

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,610
compassion, love and complete concern.

17
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,000
Discretion is the only way we can manage and
one has to use all kinds of methods of discretion

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,210
to save these people.

19
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,510
Once a maximum number is saved, the rakshasas
can be destroyed.

20
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:58,340
As it is they are so much exposed now, they
are getting destroyed by themselves, by their

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
own behavior.

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,310
That’s the best about the falsehood, that
it shows itself.

23
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,280
The effects are shown.

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:20,180
In the process we also find that the effects
of these devils are still in our behavior

25
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,720
sometimes lingering.

26
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,040
So all the Sahaja Yogis who have been to other
false gurus should be careful so that they

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,620
should not be any more dominated when they
are ascending.

28
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:40,470
Also there are other effects of our past,
our aggressiveness, our incompatibility, our

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,530
anti-collective activities.

30
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,260
All this comes from the grossness of personality.

31
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,120
As soon as your grossness becomes subtler
and subtler you’ll merge, dissolve into

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,650
the collective understanding, very easily.

33
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:08,270
Now, the 
things that I have to do sometimes looks like

34
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:18,220
mountainous and I seek your help in every
way.

35
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:27,070
I cannot do it alone, so I seek your help
and I ask for your guidance in many ways,

36
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,950
because human beings are not easy to understand.

37
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,180
You have to ask human beings what they are
up to.

38
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,950
Now, the first task is ahead of you is to
save yourself from negativity from within,

39
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,340
from within.

40
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,440
You might find one or two murmuring souls
here and there talking nonsense about the

41
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,650
program we had, the tour we had, the way we
went round, about nonsensical thing, which

42
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,120
has no meaning to the spiritual life.

43
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,060
Or maybe some people who would be grudging
about something else, whose attentions have

44
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,770
been on some other things.

45
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,380
So forget about them, because you should worry
about your ascent.

46
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,260
The negativity can also come from your own
understanding of things.

47
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:22,100
My only effort was to see that you forget
the rest of the world and start ascending

48
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,940
in collectivity, as well as in your own spiritual
growth.

49
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,090
These are so simultaneous that I cannot differentiate
between the two.

50
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,760
Like the sun when it rises the sunshine comes.

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,410
It’s like that.

52
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,210
So, one has to be very careful about this
point, that when you go from here, anybody

53
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:49,400
who starts talking in the anti way, just put
your hands on your ears and say that, “This

54
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
is not…

55
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
We don’t want to hear.

56
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,950
Please don’t make us pull down”.

57
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,370
Because they’ll pull you down and some who
are half-baked Sahaja Yogis will fall down.

58
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,280
I hope all those who have come will stick
to what they have achieved, what they have

59
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,750
felt, what they have understood and go further
with it.

60
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:17,570
The wholesomeness, the wholesomeness of the
experience is to be envisaged, to be felt

61
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,710
when you are gone from here.

62
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,830
Just to think of it, the memory of that, the
Mahakali Shakti of that will give you all

63
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:33,811
the beautiful experiences, the shiver, which
we call the shiver of the experiences and

64
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:41,180
you will enjoy the thrills that you had in
India, again back when you are in that country.

65
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,300
And those thrills will fill the atmosphere.

66
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,150
The atmosphere changes tremendously.

67
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:53,520
When the Sahaja Yogis increase in sizes, the
atmosphere changes and the climate changes.

68
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,090
Not only that, but human beings also start
changing.

69
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,750
So it is necessary for us to have more and
more people coming to India.

70
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,580
So now, first your own negativity is to be
seen.

71
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,160
Then, you must see among Sahaja Yogis, we
are one.

72
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,250
Never criticize another Sahaja Yogi.

73
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,870
Never talk to other Sahaja Yogi harshly.

74
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,330
We are very kind to other people, because
we know that if we talk like this to another

75
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,500
person that person will not accept it and
he will react.

76
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,350
But with Sahaja Yoga many people try, I have
seen, to talk to each other in a very rough

77
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,620
manner and sometimes in the organization also
they try to aggress.

78
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,600
Like some arrangement is there so they’ll
say, “Why not this?”

79
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,180
Try to give up most of the things that you
want to say.

80
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,390
Is very simple, like that.

81
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,680
That, now supposing say to have this color.

82
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,930
Just keep quiet, see what happens.

83
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,270
Because you think you can give a suggestion
you just give a suggestion, because you must

84
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,370
say something.

85
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,940
Not necessary.

86
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Not necessary.

87
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,720
Because you have seen in Japan, only one person
speaks.

88
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,520
You see, if there is necessary to say something,
then you should say.

89
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,530
Otherwise, unnecessarily, just to create a
new idea, a new theme, a new stuff, is not

90
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,210
proper.

91
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:21,760
Now, the main thing about Sahaja Yoga is this,
that it does not belong to any country.

92
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,740
It belongs to the country that is God’s
kingdom.

93
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,730
So it’s a very different thing into which
you have landed.

94
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,060
Once you realize this, once you accept this
situation that you have now entered into the

95
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:42,210
kingdom of God, your sense of security will
be built up, your style will be built up,

96
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,980
your behavior will improve, your attitude
towards yourself will improve and you will

97
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,060
really feel you have jumped into the sea,
the ocean of joy.

98
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,210
Just assume the power.

99
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,840
Assumption is very difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

100
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,650
Reality people assume with difficulties.

101
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,390
If it is unreal, if somebody can mesmerize,
you believe it.

102
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,110
So just believe that you are in the heaven
now.

103
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,870
This is the kingdom of God and this is where
you have to be and enjoy that.

104
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,240
You will be amazed.

105
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,480
Once it happens, all your seeking will end,
all your frustrations will end and now you

106
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,670
will know that you have reached that situation
where now you have to give.

107
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,870
Now you have become the light and light has
to give.

108
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,980
That’s the job of the light and you will
not be any more bothered about how to keep

109
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,970
light going, because once you start giving
it that way it freely moves.

110
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,850
The collectivity cannot come with mediocre
efforts.

111
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,540
Like many people think that if you invite
people for tea or something like that then

112
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,160
the some more people will come.

113
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,210
Such people never stay or those people who
like very sweet words to be said to them and

114
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,830
all that, they just come for a picnic sort
of a thing, have a very sweet sitting down,

115
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,640
some sort of a group, and then they disappear.

116
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,020
So, we have to have people who are of quality.

117
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,310
To begin with we have to have people of quality,
to end with also we have to have people with

118
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,310
quality.

119
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,920
The people who are peripheral are headaches
for Sahaja Yoga.

120
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,120
They come, trouble us from the sides.

121
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,010
Like you see these skirmishes we have from
the outside, that’s how they come and just

122
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,810
hit some people on the outside and [unclear:
sounds like won’t go out].

123
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,010
So the people who are on the periphery are
of no use to us.

124
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,930
So try to have people of quality as far as
possible, as many as can.

125
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,080
The popularity is not the point in Sahaja
Yoga.

126
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,770
Is the quality, what you achieve and where
you reach.

127
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,820
If the quality of the people is poor, just
give them up.

128
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,230
Forget it, don’t argue with them, don’t
try to persuade them, don’t try to bring

129
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,230
them.

130
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,700
This is one of the understandings we should
have.

131
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,520
We should not go on fighting for the whole
world.

132
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,240
Where is the place in God’s heaven to fit
all these nonsensical people?

133
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,030
There’s no room there.

134
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,370
There’s no room.

135
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,330
So better have it, because they don’t deserve
it.

136
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,740
So don’t try to push such people into it.

137
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,460
We are trying some experiments with some people
who are very difficult and useless.

138
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,560
We are trying to push them here and there.

139
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,310
If they do not work out, we’ll have to throw
them out.

140
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,310
And you must accept it.

141
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,620
There should be no compassion for such people,
but compassion for other Sahaja Yogis who

142
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,980
are suffering from them.

143
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,900
That’s the best way to have compassion is
to understand these are saints and they are

144
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,560
suffering because of the negative people,
so why push them into Sahaja Yoga and trouble

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
everyone.

146
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,430
That’s not the way it should be.

147
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,020
Now, so this is one of the things one should
understand when you are organizing, that have

148
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,640
people of quality.

149
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,410
If you have ten people of quality will create
ten thousand tomorrow.

150
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,160
But, if you have even one hopeless fellow,
it will kill even the rest of the nine.

151
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,090
So be careful that you don’t allow people
who are not of quality to come to puja.

152
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,160
Outsiders should not come to puja.

153
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,410
Only the people who are of quality should
come, and those who have been now traveling,

154
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,330
we have been noting how they have been behaving,
how their behavior has been, how they have

155
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,330
been progressing.

156
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,890
We know all about every one of them.

157
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,930
So, we’ll see them, how they are progressing
further when I visit your countries and I’ll

158
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,930
see for it.

159
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,190
And then, I’ll be able to tell you that
such and such person has not progressed at

160
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,190
all.

161
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,589
So, this should be the attitude that we all
should individually progress and once we progress

162
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,000
individually it shows in collective enjoyment.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,060
A person who cannot enjoy collectivity is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

164
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,920
Now Leader can be only one; there cannot be
three leaders.

165
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,360
Now for all purposes I have appointed Danny
as the Leader of United Nations, United … ah,

166
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,900
that’s the word … that’s the word … that’s
the word…ah, we should say United States,

167
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:11,740
but then we have to have United Nations later
on.

168
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:23,140
Because I find in Danny those qualities which
are required for a good Sahaja Yogi.

169
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,260
He’s very congenial.

170
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
He knows how to go round people.

171
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,990
He is very steadfast in his own ascent and
he is a person who doesn’t shout at people,

172
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,100
who doesn’t get angry with people too much,
and I haven’t seen him getting angry with

173
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,269
anyone whatsoever, so far.

174
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,470
I have been with him for so many days.

175
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,440
And, he manages people very well and he knows
how to control them.

176
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,910
But, he is extremely strong as far as Sahaja
Yoga is concerned.

177
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,920
Extremely strong and he understands it.

178
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,840
So, all these qualities can help you people
very much to understand how a leader should

179
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
be.

180
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Moreover, he is selfless.

181
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,000
He has no selfish aims for anything whatsoever,
for his name, for his position, for anything

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have seen.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,430
He doesn’t mind anybody becoming a leader,
he doesn’t mind anything whatsoever.

184
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,080
That sort of a thing should be that anybody
becomes a leader is just a joke.

185
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,430
Otherwise, I have seen people, you make them
the trustees they just ride on the horse.

186
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,060
You make them something, leader, they ride
on the horse.

187
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,250
All sorts of things happen.

188
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,460
That should not happen any more, and the leaders
must see to the point that they have to become

189
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,529
really great evolved avadhutas.

190
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,120
Otherwise they cannot impress people.

191
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,800
Avadhutas are the people who are extremely
compassionate, extremely kind and for you

192
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,490
I would say you should follow the example,
Tukarama, because he was such a kind and a

193
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:51,930
sweet person, but he said things which were
very, very deep and very straightforward.

194
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,950
So the forthright behavior need not be so
sharp as to cut everybody through.

195
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,310
Forthright could be such that it guides the
person in the proper way and the plying of

196
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,110
a person in this ocean of maya becomes easier.

197
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,329
That is what is called the leadership.

198
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,050
Now leadership should not be challenged.

199
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,230
Some people have too much ideas from outside,
because they think they are something, you

200
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,400
see, they know.

201
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,320
They are administrators or they are journalists
or they have worked as some sort of a politicians

202
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,690
or this and that, and they try to control
the leaders, is a wrong thing.

203
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,190
So now do not try to control the leaders.

204
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,270
If there’s something wrong I’ll correct
them.

205
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,820
This is very important, because again and
again I tell you that once you start challenging

206
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,480
the leader I get the pangs of it.

207
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,529
So, please do not do it.

208
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,130
If you do not want to hurt me, do not challenge
the leader as he is.

209
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:55,510
Now, as you are going away, you are taking
all the sweet memories from here of the Indians.

210
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:06,480
You have to take their last, I should say,
the glimpse and also give them a promise that

211
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,240
you will write to them, thanking them, keep
contact, have friends, write letters to them,

212
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
they will write to you.

213
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,139
Let us have contacts and know what’s happening,
where what is happening and thus we can have

214
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:27,670
a nice circulation and communication with
each other and we can establish a better understanding

215
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,350
of different countries through this method.

216
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,570
Also, those who have come from other countries,
like say Australians have come, should write

217
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,149
to English or they can write to French or
the French could write to Australians.

218
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,420
Like that there should be a big movement.

219
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,889
The circulation has to be good.

220
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:53,149
If the circulation is not good the body gets
sick, so the circulation has to be good and

221
00:16:53,149 --> 00:17:01,300
all of you have to do that circulation in
a way that is good, compassionate and in a

222
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,769
Sahaj manner.

223
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:08,439
My own work does not finish.

224
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,640
I am moving on now, as you know, to another
areas.

225
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Then I’ll be going to Calcutta.

226
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,679
For the first time we’ll be having program
in Calcutta in this way.

227
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:26,560
And then I am going to Australia and again
back, New Zealand and back to India and then

228
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,160
again back to London and I go on moving.

229
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,000
You see mine is such a circuitous, complicated
roundabout ways.

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,030
The sun has to do only one way.

231
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,570
I’m going this way, that way.

232
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,290
All sorts of movements are there, nothing
regular.

233
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,240
Absolutely it is regularly irregular.

234
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,710
It is like that, and, it’s, still it’s
working out.

235
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,040
It works out with some sort of a rhythm in
it, I think.

236
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,280
It pulsates and I feel quite happy with that
rhythmic movement.

237
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:11,200
So, I have to pray that you look after your
health, look after your spiritual wealth and

238
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,450
look after your Sahaja Yoga family in your
own countries.

239
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,540
So may God bless you all.

240
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:27,660
Section in Marathi language

241
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:36,250
I’m thanking them for looking after you
very much.

242
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:50,770
They have, I mean, gone all the way out in
the villages and in very far-fetched places,

243
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:58,490
and whatever I ask them for they arrange the
programs in the actual jungles and along the

244
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,970
riversides, and all kinds of things they have
done, just to make you feel happy and away

245
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,090
from the madding crowd.

246
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:14,799
All this has worked out, only because of their
cooperation, without any reward, without anything.

247
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,120
They have to take leave, giving up their jobs
and coming down.

248
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,330
Everything they have done so well that we
can see that how in a place like Brahmapuri

249
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,320
which is such a far-fetched place, or in a
place like Sangli where we had no rooms or

250
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,010
anything, they arranged all these tents, and
all that overnight for you people to stay

251
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,980
and to enjoy your stay there.

252
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,630
So, if there was some sort of a problem you
must understand that we don’t have tents

253
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,360
easily available in India.

254
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,380
We have to make them.

255
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,220
We haven’t got all these facilities as you
have for camping, because you are so fond

256
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,059
of camping there that if you go to a shop
you can get everything for camping.

257
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,720
Here, you have to make everything.

258
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,390
You just cannot get things for camping because
somehow Indians have no time for camping at

259
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,480
all and they have no part time for partaking
a holiday, and neither they go for a holiday,

260
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,020
and I was the other day surprised.

261
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Somebody told me that he took a taxi and went
to south of India for a trip.

262
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,970
I was really surprised.

263
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,110
How could he do it, because normally this
is seldom done, and is a good idea to go down

264
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,130
like that, meet other Sahaja Yogis and have
a little travel.

265
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,580
But they just don’t move.

266
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
They’re like Ganeshas.

267
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,960
Once set in one place they have set till they
are put in the sea.

268
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:39,220
So, it was very remarkable how so many people
have come from Delhi, all the way, and I thank

269
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:46,059
them for coming down and making this occasion
so auspicious and so good.

270
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:55,640
[unclear: may be Especially or Specially],
I have to thank Madras Sahaja Yogis who have

271
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:07,640
come all the way from Madras, it’s so far
away, to come here and to join us.

272
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,010
Of course, the Maharashtra Sahaja Yogis are
to be thanked again and again for looking

273
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:21,550
after us so well.

274
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:29,270
I hope one day we’ll be able to invite them
to your different countries and can have some

275
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,040
seminars like this.

276
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
One day, might be.

277
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,240
Such a day might come such a time when we
will be able to do it, when we’ll have our

278
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,330
own ship and people can travel on the ship.

279
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,530
And, I have such ideas.

280
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,190
You see, I’m too enthusiastic.

281
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,290
I have tremendous ideas.

282
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,590
If I tell you, you’ll be all jumping in
the air, so I don’t want to tell you about

283
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,590
that.

284
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,120
But it materializes.

285
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,240
Somehow or other, my ideas materialize, and
we should have such a seminar that we can

286
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,039
celebrate it on a ship, where the ship moves
throughout the world, and we meet every corner

287
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,309
and the shores of the world.

288
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,890
That would be a nice idea.

289
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,650
For a month, if you travel, you can do it,
the whole world, I think.

290
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:28,130
It’s not so difficult if you have a good,
nice ship, given us to us by IMO.

291
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:35,280
So, this is hoping for the best.

292
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,240
Now as it is, people are very helpful in this
country.

293
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,750
The government is very helpful.

294
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,350
We have seen the central government was very
helpful.

295
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,760
The Customs were very helpful.

296
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,970
All this has happened because one person gets
realization in the Customs, she talks to another

297
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,930
person, he gets all the Custom people to [unclear].

298
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,130
[unclear: may be One other or Another] person,
a policeman, talks to another policeman, all

299
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,330
the policemen are there.

300
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,860
But you see, the rapport in this country is
much more than it is otherwise because the

301
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,360
climate of this country is such that we are
open, our houses are open, we have a open

302
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
home.

303
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,070
We live in an open way.

304
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,240
In a village everybody knows everyone.

305
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,150
Say, in a city, now, in [unclear: sounds like
Nepal] if you tell my father’s name everybody

306
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,150
knows him.

307
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,420
I mean, everybody knows me, everybody knows
my father, and I know them, so it’s like

308
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,730
a big rapport, and that’s an advantage we
have which we can create there with the sunshine

309
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,990
of our love.

310
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,720
So, even those who are not Sahaja Yogis, try
to be kind to them, try to be nice to them.

311
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,190
Don’t show that you are fanatics or anything,
but try to be sweet and nice.

312
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,190
Try.

313
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,100
If they can come, well and good, but do not
insist, do not force them.

314
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
That’s the worst thing.

315
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,740
Never force such people to come in because
such people, if they come, they are very great

316
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
troublesome people.

317
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,840
They are of no gain to us, so just do not
force anybody to come.

318
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,460
There are your relations, brothers, sisters,
husband, wife, just forget them.

319
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,620
If they want to come, let them come.

320
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,059
Otherwise, just forget them.

321
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,860
Don’t bother your heads about them.

322
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,350
Now, regarding next tour, I don’t know how
we could manage it next year but I’ll let

323
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,370
you know about it in time so that we can arrange
it in a better way than this time.

324
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,140
Maybe we might have again two tours, I don’t
know, or maybe fifteen days’ tours, or something

325
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:24,850
like that, so that we do two sides of tour
in fifteen days, something like that.

326
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,590
So, we’ll try to evolve new ideas as you
have seen that realization giving is becoming

327
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:38,400
simpler and simpler, and maybe that just attending
the program, people might get realized.

328
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,780
It may happen like that, one day in India.

329
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,010
I would like to have sensible, proper, constructive
ideas from you for your country.

330
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,580
That’s a very good idea, but do not condemn
somebody else and say that that fellow’s

331
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,600
like this and that.

332
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,830
That I don’t like at all because I know
who is who.

333
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,360
So, just tell me if you have any constructive
ideas about this, about propagating, going

334
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,120
to some new countries.

335
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,830
Like, Gregoire wanted to start something in
Greece, and there are some people who want

336
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,299
to do it in Greece also.

337
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:18,691
So, we have to see how we can work it out
in Greece and we have to find out people who

338
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:22,600
will work it out in other places, wherever
you think you can do it.

339
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,590
Like Tunisia, some people said it would be
a good idea to enter into.

340
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,400
But you just work it out and let me know whatever
countries you think we can do this.

341
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,700
Maybe Brazil, maybe another place, one could
go.

342
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,780
But now I think, before I go there, some of
you should go, work it out, establish a centre,

343
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,460
have a proper centre running, and then I should
go.

344
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Is better.

345
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,520
Otherwise it is quite wasted.

346
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,680
That’s how we are going to propagate in
the west.

347
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,080
In the same way in India, also we have to
do the same.

348
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,429
I used to propagate it in such a manner that
we ourselves travel a lot.

349
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:07,780
Say we are living in a place like Delhi, we
can go along, meet people of different organizations,

350
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,110
talk to them and organize that we’ll come
and talk.

351
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,210
It’s not necessary for me to go there.

352
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,190
You can all talk and give lectures, in different
organizations, in different institutions and

353
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,730
in different municipalities and all that.

354
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,970
In India it is much easier to organize these
lectures.

355
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,530
Indians are very fond of listening to lectures.

356
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,210
So that would be a good idea.

357
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,420
But for westerners also, like in universities
you can handle professors and talk to them.

358
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,120
On your own you can think of so many things
that you can do.

359
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,440
And, I’m sure one day will come that all
these efforts will work out.

360
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,110
As I told you about Buddha’s disciples used
to do.

361
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,460
And, I need not go to all these various places.

362
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,360
You can manage it and seeing you only, people
will get to Sahaja Yoga much faster, because

363
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,380
they’ll think, the one who has given them
this, if they are so great, then that the

364
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,140
person who has given must be greater and I
need not see them, because sometimes they

365
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,270
get disappointed to see me also.

366
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:15,120
They think that a person who was talking to
us was very brilliant and this and that, andin

367
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:27,270
my own swabhava of Mahamaya I 
try to fumble and sometimes make mistakes

368
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:36,760
and try to become a simple housewife, and
then people don’t understand that this little

369
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,250
housewife, a government servant’s wife,
you see, that’s another gone case, and then

370
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,320
an Indian Christian and all that thing, then
she’s must be hopeless.

371
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:57,720
So all these things, you see, make up for
the mind and that’s how the, one can go

372
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,370
into the final decision of the last judgment.

373
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,400
You see, Mahamaya is the only way one can
judge people.

374
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,820
There’s no other way out.

375
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:14,070
Those who can see through the Maya, only such
people will be redeemed.

376
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:19,790
Those who cannot see through the Maya cannot
be redeemed.

377
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:29,430
So Maya is important.

378
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:50,299
Now the last, but not the least, remember
that your Mother loves you very much.

379
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:54,980
Thank you very much.
