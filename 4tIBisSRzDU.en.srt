1
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,717
I have to tell

2
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:20,463
you thank you very much for this celebration,
for all these beautiful balloons; but, looking

3
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:24,907
at these balloons, we have to
also see some of them who have lost their

4
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,813
air completely.

5
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:36,320
This is another problem we face in the West
because to have ego itself, according to the

6
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:40,095
Western culture, is a very great achievement.

7
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:48,693
And when we start living with our ego I know
how one looks like.

8
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:53,767
He really looks like a stupid fellow.

9
00:36:53,767 --> 00:37:02,897
When he talks, when he describes himself,
you don't know where to look because just

10
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:06,375
feel like laughing at his stupidity.

11
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:12,940
Ego is the outcome of stupidity.

12
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:21,720
I don't know what to say; how to give a simile
to ego, because it's just bloated and makes

13
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:30,411
you float in the air, and when it bursts you
are down on the earth.

14
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:35,960
But you are not down on the earth the way
Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but

15
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,280
you are completely finished.

16
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,360
All your arrogance goes to waste.

17
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,390
You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you
have this ego in your head.

18
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,650
I have known people who have this ego.

19
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,690
They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they
want to think that they know more than anybody

20
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,760
else.

21
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:10,620
To know about yourself you have to go deep
down, and to go deep down you have to give

22
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,580
up all this idea which makes you float in
the air.

23
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,390
Imagine if you have a big balloon attached
to you.

24
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,380
How can you go deep down into the sea?

25
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,980
You cannot.

26
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:41,390
That kind of a air which makes you float in
the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity,

27
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:49,620
what else -I mean English you will think there
are no words- stupidity means everything.

28
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,320
Then you may think no end of yourself.

29
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,810
You may think whatever you like, you can behave
the way you like and all that but what do

30
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,570
you achieve?

31
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,860
You achieve nothing out of it.

32
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,079
Whatever you achieve people are jealous of
you.

33
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,080
They want to harm you.

34
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,130
You have no friends.

35
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:21,419
Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people
know who has got this problem.

36
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:28,889
So, I've seen people when they start talking
they say, “Ah!

37
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:31,409
We know, we know him.”

38
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:38,840
Once I had an experience, long, long time
back in Pune where the people who were owning

39
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:47,859
that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's
program because She is not a Brahmin.

40
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:51,210
So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll
give it in the newspaper because She is not

41
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,320
a Brahmin we cannot have a program.

42
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:04,449
So, these people came to My program and the
owner of that was sitting on the gallery on

43
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,449
top.

44
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:06,479
He couldn't even walk.

45
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:12,199
He was suffering from some sort of a funny
disease.

46
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,600
So these people suddenly start.

47
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I didn't know.

48
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
They didn't tell Me anything.

49
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,479
They didn't tell Me that these people have
protested or whatever it is.

50
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:26,780
So they all started shaking like this, like
this, like this.

51
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,639
I said, “What is this?”

52
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,930
So I said, “What is it?”

53
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,430
They said “Mother, stop it.

54
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,870
We know You are Shakti but stop it.

55
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,550
It's too much, too much.”

56
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,229
“But what did you do?”

57
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:45,240
They said, “We didn't do anything.

58
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,240
We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and
a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly

59
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,879
resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You
cannot have your program.”

60
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:00,160
I said, “Really, that's all ?”

61
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,690
“Yes, yes, that's all.

62
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,000
But it's, you see on the other side, you see
those people?

63
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,600
They are also shaking with Your power.”

64
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,650
So I asked them, “Who are you?

65
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,879
Are you also Brahmins ?”

66
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,120
They said, "No, no.

67
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,319
We are certified mad people from Thana.”

68
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,160
“And how are you here?”

69
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,840
They said, “There was one fellow who was
mad was cured by You.”

70
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
“Really?”

71
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,810
“So our superintendent is here.

72
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,120
He has brought us here.

73
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,770
We are certified mad.

74
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,770
Certified.”

75
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,219
My goodness, these people looked at Me.

76
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,300
I said, “See now, you tally.

77
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
You are shaking and they are shaking.

78
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,520
Now you tally.

79
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,350
Where are you?”

80
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,350
And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

81
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:58,699
Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs
I told him, "You get up and come down."

82
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:01,150
He came
and since that day he has surrendered his

83
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,560
life and did a lot of work in Pune.

84
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,410
So what I'm saying that anybody who talks
like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja

85
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:18,419
Yoga, this should not happen, we should not
have paid so much, or this leader is not good”;

86
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:27,270
should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand,
and put it before the photograph.

87
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:32,139
If you can stop the shaking then you are all
right.

88
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:40,650
All of you can try this.

89
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,650
Then try on the right hand.

90
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,650
Very practical.

91
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:51,790
If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego
is shaking, and you know how to treat your

92
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,220
ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib.

93
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,289
He has told us how to treat it.

94
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,039
Now these two problems are within us.

95
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:12,349
One of them is our conditioning and another
is this ego business, and we make our mind

96
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:19,719
out of that and we are playing under the governance
of these two things which we have used to

97
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,190
make this mind.

98
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,430
Now you have to be careful.

99
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,579
You find out with left hand.

100
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:26,579
Now let's see.

101
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,050
If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned.

102
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,040
If the right hand is shaking then you are
egoistical.

103
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,850
So now you treat it.

104
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,100
You treat these two things.

105
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,230
Before Me you'll get vibrations all right
because you see I am your Mother.

106
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,390
All right.

107
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,320
But that doesn't mean you are all right.

108
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,290
You try on My photograph; that's much more
sharp.

109
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,330
So being Mother you know I play around.

110
00:43:54,330 --> 00:44:00,500
I think, I don't know what I should say, but
maybe you may not feel that way.

111
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,589
But before the photograph you put on the left
hand side a newspaper or a little paper or

112
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:07,699
a thin paper.

113
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:10,560
On the right hand side another paper.

114
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,570
One by one you try and judge yourself, what
are you?

115
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:22,110
After all you have not come here in Sahaja
Yoga to emancipate Me.

116
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:29,350
You have come here to evolve yourself and
because of that you have to face yourself

117
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:37,170
and see for yourself what is within you which
is very strong, which is troublesome, which

118
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,910
is dragging you down, which is killing.

119
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:49,490
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

120
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,949
I thought that in My absence you'll be all
enjoying it all right; you do.

121
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:03,130
Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because
of the plane, about four hours, five hours,

122
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:07,209
and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early
in the morning.

123
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,209
I said, “What's happened ?”

124
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:11,199
“The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.”

125
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:18,009
So what you enjoy in that is collectivity:
Sangat That collectivity you should enjoy

126
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:24,700
only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries
that you have built, and then you see the

127
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
joy.

128
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:33,389
All the time you'll be floating in joy.

129
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:40,300
There is a sense which people have which you
may not have before realization.

130
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,880
Some of the people, I was amazed how deep
they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Supposed to be very great men.

132
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,440
Supposed to be people of very great principles
but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people,

133
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:07,490
and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this
because inside there's a big depth, so that

134
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,759
everything is absorbed without any problem.

135
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:18,259
Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful
as to the two wheels of our mind.

136
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:23,710
One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

137
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,370
All kinds of conditionings are there, especially
in India.

138
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:31,199
In the West it is all kinds of egos you know,
different, different types.

139
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:39,694
I have seen so many types and varieties of
egos, I was surprised; to face that.

140
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:41,399
I didn't know what to say.

141
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:48,779
It's a very, very subtle thing which people
have carved out of their minds.

142
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:57,640
So for you today it is to be decided that
you are only still small children, and like

143
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:09,259
small children you must have a very clean
heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace

144
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:16,370
that is within you; and also the beauty of
purity.

145
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,800
Without purity you cannot enjoy anything.

146
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:30,839
So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people
I must say the purity of these few saints,

147
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:37,860
who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve.

148
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,920
For example, yesterday they were singing about
Ali.

149
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,370
I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

150
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,110
And His purity people are singing now; not
at that time.

151
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,850
He was killed at that time, He was tortured.

152
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,700
That always they do.

153
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,180
Then we have many others.

154
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,260
We have here Dam Dam Sahib.

155
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,060
See what a great thing to come to.

156
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,580
We have here Nizamuddin Auliya.

157
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:14,370
We have so many people in our country itself
that nobody, no other country can claim.

158
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:19,100
They have one, say in England they have William
Blake or this and that.

159
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,279
We had so many people.

160
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,279
Why?

161
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:29,819
Not because we were very good people, but
because we were to be improved.

162
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,639
Things had to be done.

163
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:33,639
So they were born.

164
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:41,899
Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you
go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so

165
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:48,060
many great saints lived there.

166
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,350
But they were all tortured, troubled, never
understood.

167
00:48:51,350 --> 00:49:00,469
It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid,
ignorant, blind people tortured them.

168
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:07,920
So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to,
first of all, find out who is a saint.

169
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,480
Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in
Hindi language, there are people who try to

170
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,230
trouble, trouble others.

171
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:27,560
If you have no recognition and understanding
of what is the truth, what is love, what is

172
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,649
pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

173
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:36,560
It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have.

174
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:44,310
You look at a person with an obtuse angle
you don't see anything, one-sided.

175
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:53,910
Now, at this juncture when I am so very old
now; I have to request that you turn your

176
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,380
eyes to yourself.

177
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,380
Introspect.

178
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:04,670
Because among you there are some people who
will try to divert your attention, will try

179
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,329
to say things.

180
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:11,800
Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest,
he is very immoral”; very easy to say.

181
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,430
What are you?

182
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:24,410
We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga
is to be consolidated through synthesis.

183
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,920
We are believers of synthesis.

184
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,529
Any divisive thing that comes into your mind
you should just throw it away.

185
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:37,900
This is a request on this day I make you - that
you please introspect.

186
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,580
Unless and until you introspect you cannot
even respect yourself.

187
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,130
You cannot even love yourself.

188
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:49,219
If you love yourself you will introspect and
find out what's wrong.

189
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:58,680
Supposing I love this sari, then if I find
any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere

190
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,209
or something I'll get it cleaned.

191
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:05,759
I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round
saying, “Ah!

192
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:09,689
See I've got so many spots.”

193
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:19,980
In the same way, you should be not proud of
whatever asahaj temperaments you have within

194
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,050
yourself.

195
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,339
And don't talk like that.

196
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:26,389
Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'.

197
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:31,100
He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

198
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,800
I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring
souls".

199
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,360
That's the only way.

200
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:44,220
In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name
is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter,

201
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,920
chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about
others.

202
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,519
He doesn't know what he is.

203
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,139
It is much more in India, I must confess.

204
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,229
I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian.

205
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:06,400
It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting
down just chit-chatting.

206
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,869
They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga.

207
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:13,890
How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper
way?

208
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,420
I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees
I should give to you?

209
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,520
Tell Me.

210
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,460
You don't know even about your vibrations.

211
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:30,380
Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you
have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution.

212
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,859
But how many are really grown up into it?

213
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,050
You can.

214
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:42,310
So I have to again and again tell you, to
make Me happy, you have to give up all these

215
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:51,180
nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand
from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:52:51,180 --> 00:53:03,570
Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge
by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga.

217
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,010
There are many who do it.

218
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,869
I am not saying they don't do.

219
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:12,800
But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil
all of them; like one bad apple can spoil

220
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,260
all the apples.

221
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,810
So what do we do -throw away the apple out
of the basket.

222
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:32,020
It is important see, even I feel all this,
standing like a witness to you, silent witness.

223
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:46,390
When I see big, big mountains, and I think
they are like great saints who are watching,

224
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:55,940
and they are trying to record what is happening
in this world because they also understand.

225
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,150
They also know.

226
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:08,330
I have to again, and again, tell you that
today is the day to see your own self, your

227
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:13,510
own chakras, your own - I should say - defects.

228
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:21,880
That will give you permanently the joy that
is promised.

229
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,270
You will get thoughtless awareness.

230
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,660
Also you'll get doubtless awareness.

231
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:38,460
But never get into the trap of your conditioning
and of your ego.

232
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,989
This is what I have to tell you today, on
this day where you are celebrating, that you

233
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:47,150
celebrate your own birthday.

234
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,010
Celebrate it.

235
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,040
See for yourself what you have achieved and
what you are going to achieve.

236
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,719
It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate
My birthday.

237
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:03,064
I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday
than to celebrate Mine.

238
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:05,439
So may God bless you.
