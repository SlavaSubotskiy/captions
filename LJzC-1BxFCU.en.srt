00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,046
Shri Ganesha Puja Berlin, Germany July 21, 1993

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:10,690
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

3
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:19,049
As you know in the whole of Europe, America, England

4
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:26,285
they have lost faith in Shri Ganesha.

5
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:34,097
Nor do they care for His powers and for His blessings.

6
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:46,108
As a result all His blessings are not on these countries.

7
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:51,211
The first blessing of Shri Ganesha

8
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:56,342
which is, I think is the highest is the wisdom

9
00:00:56,463 --> 00:01:05,063
that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us;

10
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:09,462
what is constructive and what is destructive;

11
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:17,173
what should we do to achieve our Self-Realization.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:28,165
Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.

13
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:39,675
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life.

14
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:48,331
When a person starts thinking, “Why am I doing such and such thing?

15
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:54,225
What is the effect of my doing?

16
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:59,675
What is the result of my behavior?

17
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:09,322
Is it good for me or bad for me?” then wisdom comes.

18
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:13,962
Even if some people know that this is bad for them,

19
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:18,886
still they do not have power to control themselves.

20
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,605
Still they do lots of bad things which they should not do.

21
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,612
The reason is the power of wisdom is not there.

22
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,438
A person is wise who does not only know what is right and wrong

23
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:44,177
but also he knows very well his own power not to do something wrong.

24
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:46,465
He just does not do it.

25
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:54,353
Wisdom is a complete power within ourselves by which we try nothing,

26
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:58,572
it just spontaneously works through us

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,330
and we do things which are proper and right.

28
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:14,740
In this wisdom many people have risen very high in life.

29
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:21,339
For example, we’ll take the example of Kabir.

30
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:28,103
Kabir was born to a weaver.

31
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,754
They say they don’t think he was born to him

32
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,188
but he was found by a weaver, whatever it is.

33
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,303
And he belonged to Muslim family.

34
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:47,408
But he realized that the Muslims

35
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:55,267
as they are practicing their Islam is not going to give him what he wants.

36
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,885
He has to seek his self, he has to know himself.

37
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:09,850
So what did he do, is to go on the bank of river Ganges in Benares

38
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,673
and he stayed there waiting for a great Realized soul

39
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:18,023
called as Ramananda, Swami Ramananda.

40
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:22,511
When this Swami Ramananda came back after his bath,

41
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:25,625
immediately he caught hold of his feet.

42
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:30,074
After bath if somebody catches the feet of any Brahmin,

43
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,885
he would shout at him.

44
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,492
But he was a saint, he was not a Brahmin.

45
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,765
He said, “My son what do you want?”

46
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:43,515
He said, “Sir, give me initiation.

47
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,282
I want Self-Realization.”

48
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:51,697
And Swami Ramananda immediately agreed.

49
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:55,720
All the other people said, “Sir, he is a Muslim,

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,628
he is an orphan, brought up in a Muslim family.

51
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,282
How can you give Realization?

52
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,841
He’ll not accept any of the principles

53
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:11,298
which look like coming from Hindu religion.”

54
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:18,348
Ramananda looked at Kabir; he could see a great seeker there.

55
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,683
He said, “You don’t know him, I know him.”

56
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:29,015
And he took him with him and Kabira became a great saint after that.

57
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:34,079
He’s accepted by Hindus and Muslims

58
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,280
because he had that power of wisdom,

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:47,006
he went to a man who was not belonging to his religion,

60
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:49,601
who may not have accepted him,

61
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:54,786
who might have just thrown him in the river, also possibly.

62
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,852
But he knew also through his wisdom

63
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:01,980
that, “This man is the one who will love me,

64
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:05,581
because I am a seeker of Truth.”

65
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,921
So this power of truth works

66
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,603
in not only that you know what is right and wrong,

67
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:17,818
again I say, but that you just don’t do something that is wrong.

68
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,655
Now one may say, “Mother what is the source again, of this wisdom?”

69
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:26,620
The source is Shri Ganesha.

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,230
The source is Shri Ganesha, which is the Giver of wisdom.

71
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:40,955
Once Shri Ganesha is insulted

72
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:49,306
and He disappears behind the clouds of ignorance,

73
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:54,020
then people start doing things which are unwise.

74
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,260
This happens with many things.

75
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,733
Supposing these days in the democratic countries,

76
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:08,221
they are not supposed to say anything about the morality,

77
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:13,298
about how people should behave, what should be their relationships.

78
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:15,999
They don’t try to look after the society

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,259
because they think looking after the society is not our job,

80
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,804
it’s a private affair, it’s a private thing.

81
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:27,118
As a result, people take freedom into their hands

82
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,763
and start insulting Shri Ganesha.

83
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:37,437
When Shri Ganesha is insulted,

84
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:43,593
complete blockage takes place in a human being, I think.

85
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,602
He becomes an idiot.

86
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:48,004
He becomes a stupid fellow.

87
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:56,953
He doesn’t understand how to go further with wisdom.

88
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:05,001
Without wisdom whatever steps one takes is destructive.

89
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:10,045
So this is the first quality of Shri Ganesha

90
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:15,309
that He gives us, bestows upon us wisdom.

91
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:20,937
So we have to respect Shri Ganesha within us,

92
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:25,726
is very important specially for all these democratic countries

93
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,954
which are now going to dogs, their families are destroyed

94
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,689
because their lifestyle is so horrible,

95
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:40,617
their children are ruined, in every way they are in a big jeopardy.

96
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:47,956
This wisdom can be easily brought back if we awaken their Kundalini.

97
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:54,381
If the Kundalini is awakened this Ganesha can be awakened,

98
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,380
because without His help Kundalini cannot be awakened.

99
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,932
And if Shri Ganesha knows that Kundalini is to be awakened

100
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:09,339
He forgives everything, forgets everything

101
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,146
and comes to assist you, to support the Kundalini’s ascent.

102
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,681
At every chakra He is there to support you,

103
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:22,720
till you get Realization He is there to help you.

104
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,377
In all these countries the missing point is their wisdom

105
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:34,681
and that’s why you find so much of destruction,

106
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,122
so much of nonsense going on

107
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,721
and you can’t understand why people are so stupid.

108
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:48,420
The another power that Shri Ganesha has

109
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,208
is He generates innocence within us.

110
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,155
We respect our innocence.

111
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,174
We respect our chastity.

112
00:09:56,294 --> 00:10:03,378
We respect a lifestyle which is decent and decorous.

113
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,256
In every scripture is written

114
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:11,588
that we should dress up in a way that we are decent and decorous

115
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,875
and that our body should not

116
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:27,695
in any way express a indecent feeling or indecent behavior on our part.

117
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:32,192
This is the reason why in Sahaja Yoga

118
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:36,037
we have to be particular about how we dress up.

119
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,722
I think Sahaja Yogis have realized it

120
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:43,303
that our dress should be decent, should be dignified

121
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:53,576
and that we should in no way try to show our vulgarity.

122
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:59,125
Because if innocence is the most important thing a human being should have,

123
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:05,973
if that is the complete decoration of a human being,

124
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:14,344
then one should look after one’s own chastity and one’s own morality.

125
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:17,040
In some countries, of course,

126
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,733
they think that chastity is only meant for women

127
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,727
and not for men.

128
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,306
But it's not true.

129
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:26,650
That’s what the Islamic people believe. It's very wrong.

130
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,522
It is meant for both of them.

131
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:41,612
Like a person who is trying to force the other side,

132
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:46,610
like the men trying to force the women to be chaste

133
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:51,344
and themselves are not chaste, the women will not be chaste.

134
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:54,662
They may look, appear, they may try to be out of fear,

135
00:11:54,782 --> 00:12:00,168
but if they get a chance they will take to life which is wrong.

136
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,171
Because they see the other party,

137
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,786
the men trying to dominate them,

138
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:08,577
then they think, “What’s wrong, if they can do it why not we do it?”

139
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:13,416
So the whole society has to take to very decent life

140
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:23,695
and to a very, very decorous, dignified lifestyle.

141
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:29,663
It's not only in dress but even day-to-day life it is important.

142
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:39,118
Otherwise a kind of a insecurity start working among men and women

143
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:45,251
and too much complications, too much complicated life starts.

144
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,854
The third quality which I am saying today

145
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:55,128
is that a person who is innocent

146
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:01,576
should not fear because God looks after innocent people.

147
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,868
They are always protected.

148
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:09,441
If anybody tries to harm the innocent God protects them,

149
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:14,513
and that’s how you have seen many children who fall from high stories

150
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,357
they are saved and so many things happen.

151
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:22,317
But also we see many children are being killed

152
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:25,656
by people who are extremely aggressive.

153
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:31,218
Of course that is very, very cruel and wrong to do,

154
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,121
to kill the innocent children but when these children are killed,

155
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:39,331
actually nobody is killed as you know very well,

156
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,192
the whole world gets shaken up;

157
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:47,317
anything happens to children the whole world gets shaken up

158
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:52,060
and then the whole world start protecting the innocent.

159
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,790
If some people, men are killed or something happens to them

160
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,839
nobody is so much bothered, but even one child is in difficulty

161
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,667
all the people combine together to save that child.

162
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,869
It’s so important,

163
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:09,079
it's not the child, but the innocence of the child

164
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,697
that generates that feeling that we have to save

165
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:19,397
that innocent, little thing which is having a problem.

166
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:22,810
That’s why in the whole history you find

167
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:30,267
wherever there have been description of children being killed

168
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:34,512
or where innocence has been attacked,

169
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,480
the whole society, historically also, has revolted against it.

170
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:44,528
And this revolt comes from Shri Ganesha’s power,

171
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:51,547
that He can definitely create a feeling of detest

172
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:55,001
for people who try to be unkind to children.

173
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,018
If you see in the newspaper also

174
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,241
they will show how the children are suffering.

175
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,305
What is the problem of the children, what they suffer?

176
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:11,191
It’s a very, very touching thing to hurt the children.

177
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:16,968
In Sahaja Yoga we have now children who are born-realized

178
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,910
and we understand their innocence.

179
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,230
We try to keep them out of bounds

180
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,712
from all these horrible things that are happening today in the world.

181
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,802
And we are trying to look after them

182
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:35,221
so that they grow up into children who are not only born realized,

183
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:43,050
but who will save others from the dilemma of getting themselves ruined

184
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:47,740
and by not respecting their innocence.

185
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,813
This respect of innocence once it’s developed,

186
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,363
through such happenings, through their own children,

187
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:06,108
through their own relationships, then the whole nation can be saved.

188
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:09,395
Another way is to worship Shri Ganesha

189
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:14,738
which comes from the Mother Earth, the principle of innocence.

190
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:19,281
The Mother Earth is so innocent, whether you are good or bad,

191
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,825
She gives you fruits, She gives you trees, She looks after you.

192
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:29,473
Whether you are telling lies

193
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:33,240
or you are deceiving people, still She does it.

194
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,441
Of course up to a point

195
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:41,230
and after that She may bring forth some sort of a calamity

196
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,555
like an earthquake, or something like that.

197
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:48,596
Now the earthquake mostly suspected always

198
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:52,331
in the Los Angeles area, very much.

199
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:57,974
And they have practically every year there is a shake-up there.

200
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:03,764
The reason is the media of cinema is in Los Angeles

201
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:09,167
and they are generating all these funny ideas

202
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:14,896
about insulting Shri Ganesha within us.

203
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:20,117
This is the reason why all the time

204
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:24,327
there is a complete danger for these people

205
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:28,028
who are living in that area who support that.

206
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:34,114
Also America seems to be quite in danger as far as the nature is concerned.

207
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:39,601
The reason is from America all these ideas ooze out

208
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,662
and people accept them blindfolded.

209
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,445
I don’t know why they accept these ideas.

210
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,337
These ideas have come to us, say, we can say that Freud has brought it.

211
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:53,015
Now Freud could not prosper in Germany.

212
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,582
He was here, he was in Austria,

213
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:59,071
he could not prosper here; people didn’t listen to him

214
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:02,458
but when he went to America, he got all the support

215
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:07,360
and with that support he prospered.

216
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:11,093
He got that support because

217
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:18,921
he opposed completely the idea of leading a chaste life.

218
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,393
And he said, “This is all absurd, this is all nonsensical

219
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,874
and one should not listen to all these things.”

220
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,556
And he started the whole theory

221
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:37,194
on a very, very demeaning principles and people accepted.

222
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:42,372
Then same Germans, same Austrians, same Europeans

223
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:45,789
accepted Freud blindfolded.

224
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:53,156
Because somehow when it comes from America it becomes collective.

225
00:18:53,276 --> 00:19:03,070
Because as you know America is the country of Shri Krishna

226
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:10,792
who is for the people, who is for collective

227
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:15,456
and that’s how whatever comes from America becomes collective.

228
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:18,419
And if it is poison it spreads very fast

229
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:23,266
and it really paralyzes the whole world.

230
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,280
So now we have to be wise

231
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,575
to see what is destroying us and what is destroying our inner being.

232
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:37,765
For Sahaja Yogis it is very important

233
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:43,031
because if say there’s a cloth or a sari

234
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:46,578
which is blown off by the wind,

235
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:51,152
even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it.

236
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:55,012
And after some time the whole thing can subside.

237
00:19:55,132 --> 00:20:00,865
And this is what has to happen actually to the world,

238
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:09,621
when Sahaja yogis will hold the sari, we can call,

239
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:19,031
or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.

240
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:25,741
Otherwise they can be blown off also if they are not rightly placed,

241
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,880
if they are not grounded,

242
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:35,187
if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga

243
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,617
they can be blown off with this wind

244
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:43,969
which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.

245
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:47,448
So the responsibility of Sahaja yogis is very important

246
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,160
that their Ganesha principle should be all right.

247
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:54,188
If it is not all right then

248
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:59,486
the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.

249
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:04,458
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request

250
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:08,482
that they should try to put their Shri Ganesha

251
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:15,081
in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.

252
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:19,462
That should be the highest, the most important

253
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:26,204
and also every day to be remembered.

254
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:35,055
That we are very much blessed by Shri Ganesha to get our Self-realization.

255
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:39,681
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha which I have described.

256
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:44,294
One of them is that He is a child.

257
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:47,618
And He is very humble, He is very playful,

258
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:51,469
He is very interesting and He is extremely humble

259
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,254
and despite His weight, He is very lightweight

260
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:58,179
because He can sit on a small little mouse.

261
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,055
He doesn’t try to show off,

262
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:06,271
He doesn’t have His vahanas as great as Vishnu’s or anything.

263
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:10,197
His vahana is very simple, the simplest,

264
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:19,052
or we can say the smallest creature which can really crawl is a mouse

265
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:23,186
and He uses this mouse. With this mouse

266
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:30,510
He expresses His own power that He doesn’t need any other vehicle.

267
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,739
It’s His vehicle, is His simplicity.

268
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:40,762
He moves, He penetrates and He affects the lives of people

269
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:46,608
through very, very simple, sweet methods.

270
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:51,232
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize how do we impress others?

271
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:54,236
For example, nobody will be impressed in Sahaja Yoga

272
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:58,533
if you have a very great car or anything

273
00:22:58,653 --> 00:23:06,554
or if you have very wealthy expression of your life.

274
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:09,099
Nobody feels impressed, I have seen that.

275
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:16,620
What impresses people is the simple expression of your love

276
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:19,682
through certain gestures,

277
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:25,503
through certain presents, through certain behaviors.

278
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:28,397
And I have seen people who are very sweet,

279
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:34,648
who just express themselves in such an innocent simple childlike manner

280
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:38,684
that goes into the heart of the people.

281
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:42,648
I mean they describe to Me sometimes the Sahaja yogis,

282
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:46,961
other Sahaja yogis, it is very surprising how they express

283
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:54,094
their appreciation of other Sahaja yogis,

284
00:23:54,214 --> 00:24:03,536
is very, very sweet and extremely loving, delicate,

285
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:07,135
all that is like a child.

286
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:12,165
How a child plays around and how he amuses you,

287
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:21,942
how the child tries to do things for you.

288
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:26,447
Like I know My grandchildren,

289
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,162
they would be sitting outside when I was having My bath.

290
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,065
They were all born-realized.

291
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:34,146
So when I came out what I find, they are sitting there

292
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,163
with the powder to be put on My feet,

293
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,652
with the scent to be put on My hands,

294
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:41,678
I mean all such things they would be there.

295
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,907
And I never told them, nobody told them but they would be sitting there.

296
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,934
If I am lying down

297
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:55,359
then they would come and cover Me up and all the time trying to see

298
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,197
how they can look after Me,

299
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:03,490
like, as if they are My parents or they are bigger than Me

300
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:08,556
and also to guide Me, in a way.

301
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:12,765
For example if I am walking then if they see a stone or something,

302
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,557
then they would put their hands, “Nana, You don’t come here,

303
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:18,013
there is a stone here. You be careful, go that way.”

304
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,543
As if I have no eyes to see,

305
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:22,645
they are the ones who are My eyes who are telling Me to do all.

306
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:27,233
So sweet, I have seen in their childhood how careful they were

307
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:33,007
and they knew what I like, what I don’t like.

308
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:37,317
So sweet and so assuring

309
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:45,155
that they were all the time trying just to understand Me.

310
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,394
That is what is the other quality of Shri Ganesha is

311
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:55,034
that He always tries to please His Mother.

312
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:59,593
He doesn’t want to do anything that will make Her unhappy.

313
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,787
He doesn’t say, “No.”

314
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,710
With some Sahaja yogis have a bad habit.

315
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,321
If I tell them something they’ll say, “No, not that.”

316
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,902
This is not to be done.

317
00:26:09,022 --> 00:26:13,093
The respect of the Mother one has to learn from Shri Ganesha.

318
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:21,292
In that I find people are little over-smart.

319
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,015
Say if I say something, immediately they'll correct Me, “No, not that.”

320
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,619
This smartness is not very helpful, I think.

321
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:37,739
Because if I say something, if I may say also that today just now,

322
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:44,383
“It is morning time,” supposing I say.

323
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:48,494
Now you will immediately go, “No, no, no, it is not morning time.

324
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:51,057
Can’t You see - this is evening time?”

325
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:54,660
So what have you achieved?

326
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:57,687
I know it is evening time.

327
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:04,740
But why did I say, “It is morning time?” Just to see.

328
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:09,126
You don’t achieve anything by that.

329
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:14,513
By saying “No, not that, this was not so, this is so,” this is smartness.

330
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:18,852
But with this smartness, you outsmart yourself.

331
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:22,337
So what did you achieve it? You see, what you have to show?

332
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,614
See, what did you achieve?

333
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:29,980
By doing these comments or saying like this or talking like this,

334
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:33,250
what did you achieve? Nothing.

335
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,695
But you are tested all the time.

336
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:45,973
And in that testing you find out what’s wrong with you.

337
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:50,345
It's very important for people who are more close to Me

338
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:53,800
to understand that if I say something,

339
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,821
do not take it very literally, you see, because I am Mahamaya also.

340
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:02,709
If I say something it may be just to test you.

341
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:06,094
Then you go on, “No, not this, not that.”

342
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:13,592
It’s the mind which is just absorbing

343
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:17,941
even the testing, it's taking the testing.

344
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:26,859
Then only you will know that you are being tested

345
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:31,619
and that your testing is just to see

346
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:36,376
how far deeply you understand Me.

347
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:43,417
But there are also some other people who misinterpret Me.

348
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,290
I’ve seen, it is very wrong to do that

349
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:50,163
but it comes because they are not wise enough.

350
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,641
They misinterpret, they want to say,

351
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:57,826
“This Mother said, that Mother said, this is not good, that is not.”

352
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:06,146
They try to show off themselves

353
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:09,811
by saying that “We have understood Mother very well.”

354
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:13,654
It’s not easy to understand Me, I must tell you very frankly.

355
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,687
You cannot understand Me very well,

356
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:18,435
only thing try to understand yourself.

357
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,314
I am like a mirror for you.

358
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,784
So when you look into the mirror, what do you see,

359
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:30,092
you cannot understand mirror, but you can understand yourself.

360
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:38,434
So whenever you look into the mirror you try to understand yourself.

361
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,590
You don’t look into the mirror to understand the mirror.

362
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,729
Once you try to understand the mirror, the mirror will be broken and finished.

363
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,740
And your image will be also finished.

364
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:57,470
So this is a very simple thing, but quite subtle.

365
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,049
And that’s what is the quality of Shri Ganesha.

366
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:06,316
That He knows what His Mother will like, each and everything,

367
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:13,144
and He does everything that is good for Him,

368
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:17,046
because by that He is pleasing His Mother.

369
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:21,490
His complete dedication is to the Mother,

370
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:26,452
is not to any other thing, not to any other deities,

371
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,368
He fought with all of them.

372
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:32,846
He is not bothered about who others are.

373
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:36,619
He goes to all of them through the understanding of the Mother

374
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,641
and respects them through the understanding of the Mother.

375
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:43,216
But some people, I have seen, still cannot do that.

376
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:48,099
They still stick on to some sort of a deity they have been worshiping,

377
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,081
some sort of an ideology they have been having.

378
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:57,222
Then they are not fully in connection with Me.

379
00:30:57,343 --> 00:31:03,616
And that is what is that He is, just in connection with His Mother.

380
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,742
To Him She is everything.

381
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,397
She is the source of knowledge, She is the source of Joy,

382
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:12,094
She is the source of Truth.

383
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:16,111
He doesn’t have to look to anybody else.

384
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:24,061
Now it looks very egoistical to say these things in modern times,

385
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:29,491
a Woman saying like that. That, “You all behave in that manner.”

386
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:37,157
But you can understand that if you have to gain anything,

387
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:43,919
if you have to achieve any knowledge within,

388
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:53,178
if you have to ascend higher, then you have to learn from Shri Ganesha.

389
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:58,935
What He does and what is His relationship with His Mother

390
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:05,943
- which is purifying, nourishing and result oriented,

391
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:09,786
that the result is that you ascend gradually.

392
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:14,029
As I was telling yesterday to some people

393
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,497
that I have not said everything from the very beginning,

394
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,766
all the subtle things.

395
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:25,674
Gradually you have grown and accordingly I have talked.

396
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:29,252
If you were like Shri Ganesha, all of you, from the very beginning

397
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,034
I would have told you everything

398
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:34,418
but Shri Ganesha doesn’t require even to know anything.

399
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:38,380
He already knows, He is a very matured person.

400
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,786
Or we can say the most matured deity is Shri Ganesha.

401
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:48,524
Now what you have done is that with wisdom

402
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:52,381
you have grown and gradually I have told you of many things.

403
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:56,913
But I didn’t talk of many things, like the Genesis,

404
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,563
like the beginning of our life. How we came.

405
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:04,974
I have said it in a way, in a very, very gross way

406
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:08,463
but all in subtleties I have not said much.

407
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:15,336
Because I don’t want you to get to any discussion

408
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:22,016
or to any point which cannot be verified by your vibrations.

409
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:27,696
Whatever you can verify by your vibrations becomes your knowledge.

410
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:31,748
That is what gradually is told to you.

411
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:33,958
You should not interfere.

412
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:38,877
Or you should not indulge into those books and things

413
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:45,160
which talk of the origin of the Earth
and the origin of this and that.

414
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,325
You should not get into these things
because your mind will be diverted,

415
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,646
you will take to knowledge which may not be knowledge

416
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:56,405
and then you will start thinking,

417
00:33:56,526 --> 00:34:00,724
“Oh I don’t know this part, I don’t know that part.”

418
00:34:00,844 --> 00:34:05,444
What you have to know is very simple is - what are you?

419
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:09,092
You are the spirit and the light of the spirit

420
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:14,114
will tell you everything gradually as much as you can bear it.

421
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:18,721
It will not tell you something that you cannot bear.

422
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:25,245
It’s a very good analogy when we say that “You are the light,”

423
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:31,192
but the light which you are carrying is
very different from this ordinary light.

424
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:35,850
This light doesn’t understand, it doesn’t think.

425
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:42,027
Now the light which you are carrying is a light which understands, thinks

426
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:47,747
and it gives you that much of light whatever you can bear.

427
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:51,839
It won’t flash, if it will flash you’ll be shocked.

428
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,482
It won’t dim down.

429
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:59,143
It will be absolutely in relation to what you can understand.

430
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:03,320
Sometimes the deities emit too much of vibrations in pujas, I have seen.

431
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,992
But if you cannot bear it they don’t enter into you.

432
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:11,132
They trouble Me but they won’t enter into you.

433
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:15,116
So one must understand that what is important is not

434
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:18,346
what you know about this and know about that, and know about that

435
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:19,758
- is not so important.

436
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:23,254
What is important is what stage you have reached.

437
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:27,187
At what maturity you are in Sahaja Yoga.

438
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,149
Now there are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha as I told you

439
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:35,465
which I think there is no time
today to talk about it.

440
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:38,731
But gradually I have been talking about all His qualities

441
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:43,640
and all of them can be expressed and manifested in your being

442
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:49,513
if you are really respecting Him, absolutely.

443
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:54,032
That's the only way one can manifest His qualities.

444
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:55,261
May God bless you.
