1
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Today's Puja is a very great Puja for Me,

2
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:26,083
because I suddenly find that My granddaughter is missing,

3
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,125
and I got upset with it very much.

4
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:36,250
Look at Me, supposed to be Adi Shakti,

5
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,125
and why should I get so upset
about My granddaughter missing?

6
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,500
It was just a human nature,

7
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:55,667
which I realized all of us have.

8
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:02,250
If we have some responsibility

9
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:09,458
and we are not there, we get upset.

10
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,625
Thank God there are very few children here,

11
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,458
most of them have gone.

12
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,959
But we are all children

13
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,500
the way we worry, the way we are anxious.

14
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:36,125
Today I would like all of you to say

15
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,542
that a New Year has come.

16
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:48,458
And in this New Year we all should have

17
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,333
a new proposal about ourselves.

18
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:58,667
And that proposal is very difficult for people to make out

19
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:03,375
- that we are not responsible for anyone.

20
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,917
We are our own, and we live with ourselves.

21
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,417
It's very difficult.

22
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,083
Of course those who have no children

23
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,000
are very happy people that way.

24
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,083
But those who have,

25
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:27,709
those who have certain responsibilities

26
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,208
and commitments they are still hanging in the air.

27
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:41,041
They are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga, I must say.

28
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,542
Our main responsibility is ourselves,

29
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,291
is to know ourselves

30
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,166
and to depend on ourselves.

31
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,667
It is a very big responsibility,

32
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,250
because now as we will be having big functions

33
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,917
and we might feel that we are lost in it.

34
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,458
Please, try to remember

35
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,500
that  you have to remember your Self.

36
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,667
You have to know that you are there.

37
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,208
That's the message I wanted to give you.

38
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,417
I hope you'll think it over.

39
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:36,041
May God bless you all!
