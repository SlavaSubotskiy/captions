1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:08,689
I 

2
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,850
bow to all the seekers of truth.
I bow to them because they are a special category

3
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:44,539
of human beings which is described by William
Blake as the men of God who will become prophets

4
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:56,359
and they will have powers to make others prophets.
This is what is described by many other seers

5
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,699
in India also.

6
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:08,699
All over the world people have talked about
the resurrection time. Mohammed Sahib in His

7
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:17,190
Koran has described that at the time of resurrection
your hands will speak. Like when the disciples

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:28,830
of Christ got their blessings of Self realization
from the Holy Ghost which came as a cool breeze

9
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,820
upon Him they started using their hands because
they felt the power flowing through them and

10
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:48,210
they started speaking the language which was
strange. That was the language of the chakras

11
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,770
and that's why people thought they were off
their minds, they didn't understand. But today

12
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,590
we are in a special time which I call as the
blossom time. We do not have only twelve people

13
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:18,009
who are seeking, twelve hundred who are seeking,
but thousands and thousands, millions and

14
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,950
millions. This seeking has come to us from
ages, we have been seekers from ages, though

15
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:36,010
in the western contries the tradition of seeking
has lost its meaning very much because of

16
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,580
industralisation. It has grown like a tree
which does not know about its roots. In India

17
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,370
the climate was very gentle, I think, and
it's a very old country. Since long people

18
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,540
have been seeking why we are on this earth,
why God has made us human beings, why should

19
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:12,770
we be in such incomplete state.

20
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:19,770
Still we are living in a relative world if
you understand. We do not what is right and

21
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,910
wrong is. Shri Krishna has said that there
are three types of people in this world which

22
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,520
create problems. The first type is the type
which always takes to something wrong, destructive,

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,069
and run after it and destroys oneself, emotional
things. He gets emotional attachments to wrong

24
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:56,069
things, he doesn't value his life much relatively,
and he destroys himself. Then the second type

25
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,310
of people who are which he calls as the rajasikas
who are futuristic, the first are the ones

26
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,819
who live in the past, are the rajasikas, are
the people who are futuristic, as we are in

27
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,410
the West, very much futuristic. We are planning
all the time what we are going to do next

28
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:30,410
moment, but this moment, when we are here,
we are not there. They are not capable of

29
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,970
knowing what is right and wrong. Sometimes
they may do right but mostly they go towards

30
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,250
wrong because they do not know what is right
and what is wrong.

31
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,150
The reason why we go towards wrong much more
is this: that we have come from carbon, say

32
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,150
earlier, from matter. Matter always fights
the spirit. Say for example, we get used to

33
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,340
anything that is material, a chair, we cannot
sit on the ground. If you are used to a bed

34
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,940
we cannot sleep on the ground. So the matter
is always trying to give us habits. It is

35
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,940
trying to overpower us, and that's how we
start getting into a comfortable understanding

36
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,710
that we have to be dominated by matter. So
such people who are on the rajasic side, we

37
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,360
call them the rightsided people, are guided
by the ego that developed because they convert

38
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,699
matter into some form and they think they
achieved a lot. As I said, a tree dies and

39
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,620
they create a chair and that chair sits on
your head and you think you have achieved

40
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,160
a lot. So this is what happens that the ego,
as you see on the right hand side, starts

41
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,160
developing and when it develops it guides
you. It can misguide you many a times, because

42
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,820
when there is ego pampering we feel happy
and when there is no ego pampering we feel

43
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,820
unhappy. Like if you tell somebody, "Oh I
like that". Even a person, whom I met, who

44
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,040
was trying to hijack some plane. So I said,
"Why are you doing it, why do you want to

45
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,900
hijack a plane?" He said, "For the heck of
it, for the heck of it." I said, "But don't

46
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,900
you think you'll be putting so many people
into trouble this?" He said, "But I'll appear

47
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,530
in the newspapers as a great hero."

48
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:53,509
So the concept of the goodness is not there.
Benevolence is not there, but the concept

49
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,509
of something standing out, something out of
the blue, they want to show off that they

50
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,620
are something greater. And in London we have
a kind of funny people, I don't know you might

51
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:16,139
be having them here also. They call themselves
punks and they came to Me, to My program with

52
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,660
pins here and pins there. All pins actually,
in the noses, all over pins, and with the

53
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:30,300
hair dyed. I asked them, "Why do you do it?"
They said, "What's wrong?" There's no answer

54
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,410
to it, what's wrong? But what's so good about
it? Why to waste your energy on this nonsenical

55
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:43,410
thing? "I like it." If you like it then that's
the last word, "I like it." That's how we

56
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:50,789
live and thats how we grow with it. But one
must understand we are neither our conditionings,

57
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:57,770
which is the superego which is the psyche
as described by this horrible fellow Freud,

58
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,770
or we are the ego as described by other people,
say, Sartre, and all this. When he denied

59
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,889
that you should not get into any conditioning,
he had no discretion of any kind. Because

60
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,889
if you have no conditioning what do you have?
Is nothing but pure ego, pure ego. There's

61
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:32,500
something like good conditioning also and
that good condition makes us to stay in the

62
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,500
center, binds us to that central path which
is described by Buddha. You have to keep to

63
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,040
the central path.

64
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
That is, you keep with your ten valencies.
Carbon has got four, you've got ten valencies.

65
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,640
These ten valencies of balance are very important.
Once you go into imbalances because of your

66
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:05,060
superego, of your conditioning, or because
of your too much of ego, you land up first

67
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:12,410
of all into physical problems, then into mental
problems, then into spiritual problems, and

68
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,110
lastly it's finished, it's complete destruction.
Now the problems we are facing in the West

69
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,660
are coming more from the right side than from
the left side. To overcome this I thought

70
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Christ was the solution because He came as
an antidote for that. On the contrary, in

71
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,880
all the Christian nations if you find, people
have been extremely aggressive on other races.

72
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Can you believe it, they are supposed to be
Christians taking Bible in one hand and pistol

73
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:02,910
in another hand. That was really so misguiding
that in India those who were great people,

74
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,870
sages, they never understood Christ because
is described that such and such a personality

75
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,740
is going to be born. He is the one who's the
support of the universe. He is the one who

76
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,740
will die and establish the principle of eternal
life. All being described very nicely in the

77
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,310
Devi Mahatmayan, a book written about fourteen
thousand years back, you'll be surprised.

78
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,720
But when they saw these people with the bible
in the hand and the revolver in another hand,

79
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,880
or a gun, or sometimes a cannon, they said,
"This cannot be because He is supposed to

80
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,880
be saumya: means mild, mildness. That's why
they gave up the hope. We too must understand

81
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:08,930
the knowledge of the tree is not sufficient,
we have to have knowledge of the roots, and

82
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:17,490
that's why I say the seekers are a special
category of human beings who feel that they

83
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:27,250
have to still know about the roots, about
the region from where they are going to be

84
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,680
nourished.

85
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,680
The third type of people are the seekers,
the sattva gunis. They try to avoid extremes,

86
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,980
they try to keep in the center, they are the
ones who are best seekers. Of course in seeking

87
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,980
also people go astray. They go astray in so
many ways. Like, they may like a person because

88
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:03,329
he is giving them some sort of a workshop
to work out, they like to work, they want

89
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:11,070
to achieve something through work. They don't
like something that is easily available. Sahaja

90
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Yoga, saha means 'with' and ja is 'born' with
you. Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous, living

91
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,930
happening of the evolutionary process within
you, of the living God, is the living energy

92
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:35,529
within you, which is this kundalini, which
is the true desire within you to become the

93
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:42,670
Divine. How can you pay for this kundalini,
she doesn't understand money, like the Mother

94
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:52,410
Earth [the sound drops out where Shri Mataji
is telling the story of how Mother Earth germinates

95
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,480
the seed]. In the same way, the kundalini
in her own nature awakens because she is your

96
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,320
own mother. She is like a tape recorder which
has taped everything that was your past. She's

97
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,240
the one who is waiting for a chance to give
you your second birth. This is what you have

98
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,120
within yourself.

99
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,300
Now when I'm telling you about these things
you need not also believe in Me with blind

100
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,500
faith, not necessary at all. You may not deny,
but you should understand that whatever I'm

101
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:52,500
saying is like a hypothesis a scientist can
put before you. But keep your minds open like

102
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,920
a scientist has. Supposing a scientist already
knows about everything then what's the use

103
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,829
of telling anything to the scientist but as
he keeps his mind open, in the same way you

104
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:11,860
keep your minds open you'll understand this
is a hypothesis and this hypothesis if it

105
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,779
is proved, then you have to believe in it.
But we believe into things about, in nothing

106
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,180
is known to us, any kind of a mental projection
comes in, we just believe in. I'm surprised

107
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,620
how people have changed so many of their habits
suddenly because some sort of a mental projection

108
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,459
has come forward, that you must wear this
kind of dresses, that is good for you, you

109
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:43,029
must eat this kind of food, that is good for
you. Like, I went to Switzerland I was surprised

110
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,740
they were eating cottonseed. I was shocked,
cottonseeds, how can human beings consume,

111
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,790
only in India buffaloes eat. How can you eat
cottonseed?

112
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,889
They said, "This is a special now diet created
for our health."

113
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,060
I said, "I tell you will end up very fast
with this because your intestines are not

114
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,529
that sturdy as the buffalo has, you are a
delicate human being, how can you eat this?"

115
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,740
They said, "No, this is what it is said."

116
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,370
But I said, "Whenever somebody has said it,
why do you accept it readily like that? See

117
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,730
some people who are eating it first of all,
what happens to them. If they give it to say

118
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,260
some sort of animals and if they can digest
it that doesn't mean you can digest also."

119
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,820
Any sort of a fad, any sort of a new mental
idea comes to a rajasic's personality, he

120
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,820
accepts. He likes to have change all the time.
Change that what it wants to such an extent

121
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,320
that they'll change their hairstyles and everybody
will be wearing the same hairstyles. Then

122
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,860
again a second time you will see them having
another style and that is a fashion goes on.

123
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,769
They don't know by doing this they are really
creating not an individualistic taste at all,

124
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:02,769
but quite a common stuff goes on. The problem
is that we are looking at ourselves as something

125
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:11,660
superficial, something very outside. If you
dress up like this, like some people dressed

126
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,790
up just like a primitive people came to Me.
I asked them, "Why are you like this, why

127
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:26,300
do you dress up like this primitive people
like this, and all your dress is so dirty."

128
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,730
He said, "We want to be primitive."

129
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:35,310
Now by dressing up like that can you become
primitive? Your brain is so modern how can

130
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:41,300
you become primitive by dressing up like that?
This is the problem with us, we think by doing

131
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,000
something superficial we will get something
within ourselves and this is one of the biggest

132
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,750
hurdles in your seeking. You have to know
that by changing your name, by chanting something,

133
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,149
by doing all this madness that people are
doing, some people start jumping, screaming,

134
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,100
shouting, this all you can do otherwise also.

135
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Also this is not the way it's going to happen.
It is antar yoga, the inner yoga. The inner

136
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:16,559
yoga has to take place, kundalini has to rise,
you have to get your realization as an experience

137
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,529
on your central nervous system. Like as on
your central nervous system you have got the

138
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:30,019
rest of your evolution. You are a human being,
now with your own eyes you can see things,

139
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:37,019
more than the animals can see. You can feel
the dirt and filth much more than an animal

140
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:47,070
can feel. If you want a dog to pass through
a dirty lane he passes through. But not you.

141
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,129
You cannot do it because you are a human being,
you have developed a new "experiencer" within

142
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:56,830
you, a new "experiencer", which knows the
experience of the dirt and filth, and of cleanliness.

143
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,109
So you are so clean, you wash yourself, you're
keeping everything clean, you can't bear bad

144
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:09,109
smells and things like that. In some way the
evolution if it has to take place within you,

145
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:17,009
you have to develop an "experiencer" of goodness,
of righteoness, of virtue by which I don't

146
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:24,809
have to tell you, you do this, you do that,
or nobody has to tell you, but you yourself

147
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:31,809
become that. That yourself, themselves, develop
that special capacity, that special experience

148
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,090
that makes you a good person. We talk of peace,
big organisations, My husband himself is a

149
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,700
Secretary General of one of them and he says
no use because people have to be transformed.

150
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,889
Unless and until they are transformed there's
no use doing it, they are just the same. Unless

151
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:55,869
and until there's peace within yourselves
what's the use of talking about peace? We

152
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:02,869
need that transformation for which, you'll
be surprised, we are specially made. The instrument

153
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,559
is here like any instrument you can see, this
is an instrument, unless and until I put it

154
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,559
to the mains it doesn't work. Unless and until
you are put to the mains you do not work.

155
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:24,279
The energy doesn't flow through you. Let the
energy which is all-pervading, which is doing

156
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,879
all the living work.

157
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:32,879
Actually we don't do anything, but what we
do is a dead work. All the living work which

158
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:40,119
is transforming, say, of flowers in the fruits,
can we do that? For example, I say but thousand

159
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:49,139
and one, like even looking after our breathing,
pumping our hearts regularly. If you run fast,

160
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:55,919
then sympathetic goes into action, that we
control but it comes to normal, automatically.

161
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,210
How does it happen? What works it out? They
call it of course, doctors are very good at

162
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,970
giving names, our autonomic nervous system.
Now who is this auto? Auto is the spirit.

163
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,049
Auto is the spirit, they don't want to say
spirit. They don't want to use that word,

164
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:18,190
but it means that, otherwise tell us, who
is the auto. This, one has to understand,

165
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:25,190
that within us this special instrument placed.
One after another these centers were created

166
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,379
at a different stage of our evolution.

167
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:34,379
For example at the first red spot is the carbon
situation. Then as you started evolving more

168
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:43,979
and more these are the milestones within us.
Specially created within us, this kundalini

169
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:50,979
is there, which is the pure desire of becoming
one with the Divine. All other desires are

170
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:59,149
absolutely not desires, because if they were
we would have been satisfied with them. Economics

171
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:06,059
says that in general wants are not satiable.
So all our wants are something, unsatiable

172
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:13,059
stuffs. So why run after that? What is that
desire which is going to really make us satisfied

173
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,999
is this desire, is the kundalini. So this
exists within us, it is within us this all

174
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:24,220
has been made, specially.You are a special
instrument.

175
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Now this instrument must be put to the mains.
That's the only job. Then why deny it? Why

176
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,749
should we deny this? Because we have become
human beings with all these things within

177
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:45,749
us, so why not put it to the mains, and once
you put it to the mains you are amazed that

178
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,019
your own instrument what you are. You don't
know what you are, you think you're just an

179
00:21:53,019 --> 00:22:00,019
ordinary person you see hobnobbing with other
things of life? No, actually you are a special

180
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:07,999
instrument, made specially to enter into the
Kingdom of God. But only thing is, when we

181
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:15,210
are naive or when we are ignorant, we don't
understand our own value, like in the Indian

182
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:22,580
village if you take, say, a TV set and say
that you can see all kinds of dramas and plays

183
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,899
and music out of this, they'll say, "What?
This box how can it be?" Then you put it to

184
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:35,019
the mains, he's aghast, what's this magic?
To him this is a magic. For some people raising

185
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:40,859
the kundalini is magic. They always ask me
how can it be so simple. It has to be simple.

186
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:47,859
It is so vital. As when we breathe. What do
we do? Do we go to any guru or do we read

187
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,869
any book or anything? If you had to do that,
how many of us would exist. Whatever is vital

188
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:00,869
has to be simple. Whatever is living is simple.
We don't know how many things we are blessed

189
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:08,269
with. The powers of God cannot be described,
but one can say that if you see, looking at

190
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:14,619
things, see an Australian gets a child looks
like an Australian; Indian gets a child looks

191
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:20,859
like an Indian, and also the face. And if
you see to the microscopic way, how it works

192
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:27,859
out, how it develops, how the choices take
place, is something a fantastic work. You

193
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,509
cannot go into that. Is like an ocean. When
you start seeing the reality, is like an ocean.

194
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:37,320
When you start discernng it, finding it out.
It's too

195
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,099
much. So what is best to make your drop an
ocean. Just to dissolve it into the ocean.

196
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,809
Then people think that you have to surrender.
You don't have to surrender. What is there

197
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:56,309
to surrender? Only your ego, which has bound
you, only your superego which has bound you,

198
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:03,309
has to be sucked in. Let the kundalini pass
through and you become one with the Divine.

199
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:10,379
The problems of health are really shattering.
I say we'll not be destroyed by atom bomb

200
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,340
because whatever human beings create they
know what it is, like the atom bomb itself

201
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,219
has become a devil for them. They are all
worried. The Americans are worried that if

202
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:26,719
they start it the Russians will destroy them,
and the Russians are worried if they start

203
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:33,719
it American will destroy them. So let them
be busy with each other. But they are not

204
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:40,729
worried as to the real destruction which is
bubbling through. The destruction that is

205
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,960
bubbling through in America is not through
atomic bomb, but through their own mental

206
00:24:53,809 --> 00:25:00,809
disturbances, extreme behaviours, their "What's
wrong?" business. Russia same thing. Why?

207
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:07,479
The presidents are dying, what's the reason,
have you been able to find out? They are not

208
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:12,549
murdered. In America, they're murdered. The
reason, they are dealing in parapsychology,

209
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:19,450
they are dealing with all left-sided things.
Because they're dealing with these, all these

210
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,450
spirits are getting hold of them. That's why
they cannot go further. So in both ways they

211
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:32,379
are not aware so to what is going to destroy
them. But as Australia is a neutral country,

212
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:38,249
let's see a neutral point of view, that we
do not want to be destroyed by our stupidity,

213
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:44,210
nor by our foolhardiness, but let us have
our own wisdom to underdstand how we construct

214
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,009
ourselves into human beings who will be wise
people.

215
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:56,009
Now specially for Australians, I have a special
feeling for them because this first red center

216
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:03,059
is Australia, and this represents the innocence.
So whatever Australians may try to destroy

217
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:09,080
their innocence, they cannot go very far because
you have rooted into innocence. You are blessed

218
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,389
with innocence. You cannot go too far and
it's here it will start, you will see one

219
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:21,389
day, the wisdom, because this is the centre
of wisdom too. This is the centre of as we

220
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:27,049
call Shri Ganesha, the deity of innocence,
who is the giver of wisdom. So this wisdom

221
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:33,039
to give balance in this nonsensical world,
which is busy fighting and not constructing

222
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,830
themselves into better realms, will definitely
one day come through Australia, no doubt about

223
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:46,830
it. But Australians also must put down both
the feet down on the ground and don't try

224
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:54,759
to follow others, not try to copy others.
If you have faith in yourself try to develop

225
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:01,759
your own wisdom and understand that you could
one day do such a great thing that none of

226
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:06,989
these so called successful and great countries
have been able to. It's all right to have

227
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:13,989
dollar in a collapsable state, you can have
something else, but to have people who are

228
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:19,200
wise, who are not going to be deterred by
nonsense, to create such people is possible

229
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,169
in Australia.

230
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,669
Though my visits to Australia have been few,
I should say only three times, this the third

231
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:31,669
time here I am here. I wish I could come many
more times, but My own opinion is this, that

232
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,799
I have been laboring in that England, which
is the heart of universe, for the last twelve

233
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,799
years. I haven't achieved much as I have done
it here in only four years, is surprising.

234
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:53,820
You must know your own nature, you must know
what you are. You are Australians and you

235
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,820
have a special wisdom about it. Take to that
wisdom, understand that, respect it, and work

236
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,489
it out. I'm sure that will take no time for
you to understand that in your wisdom, you

237
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:14,080
must become that instrument that you are.
You have to become the spirit, that's what

238
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,080
are. You are not this temporary phase in which
you are indulging, you are not to destroy

239
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:27,659
yourself. You're not to destroy your own progenies,
but you have to save the whole world out of

240
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:34,659
this island of great people. So may God bless
you.

241
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:42,339
We take out our shoes to respect the Mother
Earth in a way, but also you must know that

242
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,940
all these centers are made of different elements,
and specially the kundalini rests in the sacrum

243
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:53,679
bone which is a sacred bone which means that
the Greeks knew about it, that it is a sacred

244
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,649
bone and is made specially of the earth element.
So one has to understand that we have to take

245
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:03,379
a special help from the Mother Earth and that's
why I said Australia is something special

246
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:03,629
for us.

247
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,399
Regarding questions also, just now we are
in a mood, you see, to get our realization,

248
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,989
is better to keep the mood on. Questions,
whatever you think, you can ask Me tomorrow;

249
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:19,989
but ask sensible questions, because you have
to be constructive and wise and there's no

250
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:28,029
need to be aggressive with Me. The other day
there was somebody who just for nothing at

251
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:37,379
all just got in a mood of shouting at Me,
for what I don't know, I didn't even hear

252
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:09,249
him what he was talking. This is not 

253
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:49,109
the way to behave. After all you all have
this instrument. Now I 
have come here to give you what you have,

254
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:43,669
your own properties. I'm just to hand over
your own keys to you. What is there to fight

255
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:16,889
with Me for that? Is it something sensible
to do? But it happens. I don't know why it

256
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:22,219
happens like that: with some people go off
their heads, they can't see things properly.

257
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:28,609
Whatever it is you please write down all your
questions and hand them over and I'll answer

258
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:35,609
them tomorrow if specifically possible, otherwise
in My lectures. I'm here only for two days,

259
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:41,950
that is today and tomorrow, so you must take
full advantage of Me, I think, whatever is

260
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,049
possible than to waste your time here and
there.

261
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:53,049
Now we have a very simple method of raising
our kundalini. So what do we do first day

262
00:32:54,149 --> 00:33:01,149
is to raise our own kundalini. We put the
left hand on the lap like this, which is the

263
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:11,129
side which we call is the power of desire,
on the lap just like this, towards Me, just

264
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:18,409
like, simple, like that on the lap very comfortably.
Sit comfortably, there's no need to push back

265
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:24,109
your head much or bend down, nothing keep
it absolutely normal. Actually you have to

266
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:28,950
lead a very normal life. Somebody asked Me,
"You have to be celibate and all that?" Nothing

267
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,049
of the kind. You have to be married, very
happily married, you have to have children,

268
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:39,019
and you will know how to lead a very sane,
sensible married life, and how to look after

269
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:46,019
your children, and you will have children
who are great sages. So I would suggest that

270
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,959
you shouldn't have all these ideas that you
have to do this or anything, as you are sitting

271
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:57,529
you will get your realization and then you
will have just to find out what problems you

272
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:03,570
have, what exercise you may have to do if
you have a very bad problem of some physical

273
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,570
side. If you have any problem, say of mental
side, or any other problem of family life

274
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:17,779
or anything, they will tell you the method,
the technique, how through your spiritual

275
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:24,619
powers you can solve them. So we have to have
our own kundalini awakened.

276
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,619
Put left hand towards Me. Now the right hand
has to go on different centers on the left

277
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,329
hand side of your body, on the left hand side.
Now the right hand is the power of action.

278
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:43,990
This is our hand we have to use because I
said you are fantastic and the fact is, the

279
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:50,109
greatest thing is that you can get your kundalini
awakened this way. So put your left hand towards

280
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:57,109
Me on the lap, very comfortably you sit down,
and the right hand you have to use for the

281
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,970
different centers.
I show you which ones, and then I'll tell

282
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:08,970
you later on when you close your eyes. So
I want to tell you first, on the heart, then

283
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:15,970
on the upper part of the stomach, then in
the lower part of the stomach, then again

284
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,730
back on the upper part of the stomach, all
on the left hand side, then on the heart,

285
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,980
then on the neck, here, little on the back
side, goes here, is very important just now

286
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,980
this is the worst of all, because when you
feel guilty this catches. Now one here [front

287
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:43,970
agnya], then here [back agnya], and then here
[fontanelle], but I'll tell you every time

288
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:50,970
where you have to put it. At the very outset
I have to request you that you should tell

289
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,119
yourself very clearly that "I'm not guilty
at all of anything." Forgive yourself, that's

290
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,119
very important. I said you are the temple
of God, you are a special category. Why do

291
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:14,490
you want to debase yourself by feeling guilty?
In My lecture if I've said something, forget

292
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:23,539
it. Just tell yourself that "I'm not at all
guilty" very clearly with all confidence,

293
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that's one of the things you have to do. All
right.

294
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:39,910
Now, we close our eyes and we don't open our
eyes till I tell you. Don't open your eyes

295
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:50,519
till I tell you because the kundalini has
to rise. Everyone must do it. Those who don't

296
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,930
want to do it should please go away. Please
be civil, don't do it, please go away. Nobody

297
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:03,930
can force this on you and this is no show
on, so please go away. Secondly, those who

298
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,990
are doing meditation should sit till you get
your realization. It will not take much time,

299
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,200
about fifteen minutes at the most. But some
people have a habit of suddenly shooting off

300
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,200
like jack-in-the-box and disturbing others.
So you have to be pleasant about it. You have

301
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,980
to be pleasant, it's nothing serious. You
are going to enter into the kingdom of God,

302
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:33,980
you are invited. There is an invitation, so
be pleasant about it and I'm sure it will

303
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:41,109
work out. Now, please close your eyes and
the doubting Thomas, you put him outside for

304
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,950
the time being. The doubting Thomas is not
going to help you. Just don't doubt yourself.

305
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:55,950
You are quite capable of getting realization,
all of you are quite capable of getting realization,

306
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:01,900
believe Me, there. Now please put your right
[hand], with all your respect to your person,

307
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,900
on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit.
So you ask Me a question, without feeling

308
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:20,940
guilty, with full confidence, a question to
be asked in your heart, you can call Me Shri

309
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,609
Mataji, or Mother, whatever suits you, "Mother,
am I the spirit?". Ask the question three

310
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:33,410
times because you are like a computer and
the answer comes to you as vibrations. Ask

311
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:40,410
the question three times. Believing in yourself.
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

312
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:48,309
Regarding feet I must tell you, you must sit
in a way the feet are parallel but not touching

313
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:54,109
each other, but touching the Mother Earth.
They should be parallel to each other, sit

314
00:38:54,109 --> 00:39:01,109
in such a way that they are parallel, touching
the Mother Earth. Not touching each other.

315
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:11,089
Ask a question, please ask a question three
times, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

316
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:24,539
Please don't feel guilty. This question is
followed by another question that if you are

317
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:46,930
the spirit, you are your own guide, you are
your own guru, you are your own master. So

318
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:55,019
now, please take this right hand down on the
left hand side on the upper part of your stomach.

319
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:04,029
Now slowly press it there. Don't say any mantras,
don't chant anything, nothing of the kind,

320
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:12,529
just don't force your mind to do anything,
it will happen automatically. Now at this

321
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,960
point, you have to ask another question to
Me three times, "Mother, am I my own guru?

322
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:27,369
Mother, am I my own master. Mother, am I my
own guide?"

323
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,920
All right. Now you take down your hand on
the lower part of your abdomen, your stomach,

324
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:15,390
in the left hand side, and push it there.
This center is very important, because this

325
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:23,779
is the beginning of asking for the true knowledge,
for the technique, how to maneuver this power

326
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,240
of God's love. So here I cannot cross your
freedom. You have to say that you want the

327
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:43,730
true knowledge, the pure knowledge. So please
say six times, because there are six petals

328
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:50,730
to this chakra, "Mother, may I have the true
knowledge?" or "Mother, please give me the

329
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:59,950
pure knowledge." Six times please. Please
don't get up halfway. It's not proper to disturb

330
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:34,690
others. Please be seated, please be seated.

331
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Now take this hand again back to the center
of the guru principle, that is in the upper

332
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:53,980
part of your abdomen. On the left hand side,
in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left

333
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:02,089
hand side. Now as you have asked for your
true technique, the kundalini has started

334
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:09,089
moving. To give her a proper cooperation,
now you have to say, with full confidence,

335
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,599
with full assertion, "Mother, I am my own
master. Mother, I am my own guide. Mother

336
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:31,519
I am my own guru." Please say this. When you
say this, the kundalini will rise higher.

337
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:41,470
At this point you have to say ten times. As
I said there are ten valencies, ten guru principles,

338
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:08,750
within us. You shouldn't have any fear, any
fear whatsoever, about kundalini. This kundalini

339
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:17,549
is your mother and she is going to bear all
the brunt upon herself to give you this realization,

340
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:21,369
because this she has been waiting for ages.
You are not going to be troubled at all. There

341
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,250
is not going to be any trouble whatsoever.

342
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:32,250
So now what we have, please close your eyes,
now what we have to do is to put this hand

343
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,519
on the heart again, back on the heart, left
hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

344
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:49,420
Take out your shoes please. Put your left
hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

345
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Take out your spectacles, please. Now keep
your eyes shut. At this point you have to

346
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:05,809
say, assert with full confidence in you, "Mother,
"I am the spirit", you are the spirit. All

347
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,380
right. Say twelve times "Mother, I am the
spirit."

348
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:46,609
Now you have to know that God is the ocean
of compassion, ocean of Divine love, ocean

349
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,720
of grace, bliss, joy, everything. Apart from
that He is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever

350
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:11,759
you might have done He is the ocean, everything
engulfs, dissolves into His ocean of forgiveness.

351
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:24,779
So please forgive yourself first of all, and
now raise your right hand in the corner of

352
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:34,779
your neck and the shoulder. Little backwards.
This is the center you catch. This is the

353
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,740
center you catch when you feel guilty. So
now please say with full understanding about

354
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:51,359
yourself. Please put the hand from the front
on the chest you put it, not backwards, put

355
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,130
it from the, on the chest, the hand on the
chest and then put it down, otherwise it will

356
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:06,130
pain. Yes. Now press it hard, press it hard,
and here you say sixteen times, with all faith

357
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:17,329
in yourself, "Mother, I am not guilty." Say
it sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty."

358
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:24,049
You have to be pleasant, you have to be happy,
you have to be joyous. Not to feel guilty

359
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:31,049
and miserable. Please say, "Mother, I am not
guilty at all." That will really help. This

360
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,400
the worst center you have today, worst, is
very painful, please say, "Mother, I'm not

361
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,400
guilty." If you still believe that you are
guilty of doing something wrong for nothing

362
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,869
at all, I would say better get a punishment
of saying hundred and eight times. That will

363
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:55,990
release you of your worries, of feeling guilty.
What do you do about it, it's a myth to feel

364
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:02,990
that way, isn't it? Ah, better. So now please
say it sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty."

365
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:43,690
Now raise this hand on your forehead across,
across and hold it tight and press it hard,

366
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:54,130
as if when you have headache, you press it
the same way. At this point you have to say,

367
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:05,410
is the mantra for this center, is, that "Mother,
I forgive everyone, Mother, I forgive everyone."

368
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,349
Now many people think that is very diffiult
to say, actually it's a myth, it's a myth

369
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:19,349
because we do not do anything whether we forgive
or we do not forgive. But if we do not forgive

370
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:28,680
others we play into the hand of others. So
please say, "Mother, I forgive everyone",

371
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:36,559
from your heart. How many times is not the
point. From your heart please say, "Mother,

372
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:50,220
I forgive everyone." From your heart.

373
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:59,230
Now take your hand on the backside of your
head, backside, on the optic lobe, hold it

374
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:12,190
tight. Here because you feel so guilty please
say, once and for all, "Oh Lord, if I have

375
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:20,779
done anything in the glory of Divine which
is wrong, please forgive me." Just once with

376
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:31,460
full understanding and heart, please say that,
"Forgive me. If I have done anything wrong,

377
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:48,190
please forgive me." All right. Now take this
hand on top of your head, and put your palm

378
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:07,990
on top of your head and press it hard and
move it clockwise, on the area that was soft

379
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:16,819
in your childhood. Press it hard and move
it. Your palm, palm, not fingers, and move

380
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:38,799
it clockwise. [Shri Mataji gives the cool
breeze through the microphone.]

381
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,660
Now please take down your hand, slowly, take
down your hand on your lap, right hand. Now

382
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:42,789
open your eyes. Slowly, very slowly. Now watch
Me without thinking, watch Me without thinking.

383
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:52,509
Though there is air conditioning, you'll find
the cool breeze coming out of your head. If

384
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:59,509
you put your right hand towards Me and left
hand on top of your head. See, now is there

385
00:53:00,819 --> 00:53:07,819
cool breeze coming? Little higher. It's a
very very subtle thing, don't doubt it, little

386
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:17,670
here, little here, please take. Put right
hand towards Me, little raise the right hand

387
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:29,390
maybe, hmm, good. Move it like that and see,
just see for yourself. Move it little bit,

388
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:39,259
see now. There is the cool breeze, not the
breeze from top. Don't doubt it, because this

389
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,640
is the breeze which will enpower you to cure
others, to cure yourself, so it's not the

390
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:52,640
airconditioner, just see this. Now, all right,
quite a blast. Now you put back the other

391
00:53:54,130 --> 00:54:01,130
hand toward Me, now, again see the 
right hand, left hand towards Me. With the
right hand you see, right hand you see, left

392
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,930
hand towards Me and with the right hand you
see. Enjoying so much, just see it's a miracle,

393
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:16,529
that's the real thing that you can't do. You
can jump, you can change your clothes, cut

394
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:21,990
your hair, cut your nose, do everything, but
you cannot get this cool breeze out of your

395
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,390
head.

396
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,289
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.
Holy Ghost is within us, reflected as the

397
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:34,289
kundalini. See now, raise it higher, it's
good. It's there, it's there. Now put both

398
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,940
the hands towards Me. See if the cool breeze
is coming in the hand. Should, but if it is

399
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:49,940
not, we'll try something else, and don't think.
It did not happen with thinking. Now put your

400
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:57,430
hands like that. Now you can push both your
hands like this towards the sky. Push back

401
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:06,069
your neck also like this and ask a question,
"Mother, is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?

402
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:13,069
Mother, is this the all-pervading power of
God? Mother is this the Brahma?" Ask a question,

403
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:22,099
push back your head. Push back your head,
and just ask. Now you're feeling the air conditioner,

404
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:28,499
but actually also you are feeling this breeze.
Put your hands towards Me. Now see, you'll

405
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:35,499
feel the breeze coming from Me. All right?
Now take it down, see in your hands, are you

406
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:45,150
feeling the cool breeze?

407
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:52,150
Yes, there it is. One more thing we have to
do now we have got our realization. Most of

408
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,279
us have felt it. Those who have not felt it,
doesn't matter, because of this center sometimes

409
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:06,430
you do not feel it, doesn't matter, but tomorrow
again you have to come and I'll establish

410
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:13,430
it. The one thing we have to do is protect
ourselves. Before we go out. Tomorrow also

411
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:18,470
before going out of the house you protect
yourself, in the night you protect yourself,

412
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,480
very simple, because now the power is flowing
through your hands. Now what you do is to

413
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,579
put left hand towards Me like this, or when
in the house just like this. Now with the

414
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:32,789
right hand you have to protect your auras
so no negative forces can trouble you. So

415
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:38,480
what you do is to raise from here to the top
of your head. Let's do seven times to seven

416
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:45,480
chakras. One, everybody should do it. I don't
want you to be caught up again, is two, and

417
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:55,039
everybody, whether you got realization or
not, is, three, again, is, four, five, six,

418
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,779
and is seven.

419
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:09,369
Now the last thing I have to tell you is how
to raise your own kundalini. You have to put

420
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:14,950
this hand, I am showing now only, before your
kundalini and move your hand in such a way

421
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:21,950
that it is first above, front, lower and back,
it's like that. Put the left hand straight,

422
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,039
moving like that, and this has to move like
that, clockwise. Now let's put it nearer the

423
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:34,039
kundalini, lower, lower, now start moving
it, that's how it moves, the hand, one hand,

424
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:42,440
moves straight, another goes round it. Now
the kundalini is up. Now make your shoulders

425
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,569
loose, put your head back, and give it a twist,
now you have tying the kundalini up there.

426
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:55,380
Let's do second time again. This is how you
do it. Three times, again you raise it. Now

427
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:01,190
you see it. The left hand will move much faster,
now you push back your head, push back your

428
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:07,579
shoulders, and just give it a second twist.
Third time you have to give it three knots,

429
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:14,579
so again please raise it higher, push back
your head, give it one twist, then the second

430
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:26,329
twist, and the third one with a big knot.
Now feel it in your hands. See now, the instrument

431
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:33,380
will work better. Like you see we have made
our connections better. Right, that's it.

432
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:41,200
Now feel this experience. This is the experience
of the spirit. Now what to do about it. How

433
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,269
to work it out, all those things...
May God bless you.
