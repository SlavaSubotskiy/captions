1
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:12,260
Today we have assembled here to do the Kundalini Puja

2
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,420
Once we had done it in India long, long time back

3
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:26,851
and this is the first time we are doing this puja here in Austria

4
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:39,989
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini, is the Primordial Kundalini

5
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:52,580
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,

6
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,826
who is the Primordial Mother,

7
00:03:56,026 --> 00:04:05,780
there is a power which is a snake in the left hand.

8
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:33,035
And the Primordial Mother has one of Her powers,

9
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,300
which we can say, as the Primordial Kundalini,

10
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,740
is a part of Her.

11
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,020
Of course, She's beyond that,

12
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,278
but She is reflected in human beings

13
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,452
as the Kundalini.

14
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,275
Now one has to know that to create an Incarnation,

15
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,322
a lot of work has gone into.

16
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,740
So many things had to be envisaged.

17
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,657
One had to have the vision that,

18
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,555
when a human being is created,

19
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:37,109
how an Incarnation can help him.

20
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,283
At different levels, we had Incarnations on this Earth

21
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,540
and they were sent with a particular idea

22
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,580
that they should achieve a particular type of ascent

23
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:02,100
in that particular time.

24
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,580
They were all part and parcel of the Primordial Mother.

25
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:20,740
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini built within them.

26
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:33,709
But the Incarnation of this Kali Yuga is very complicated.

27
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:41,460
First it had to be worked out what will be the situation

28
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,029
in which this Incarnation would be born

29
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:55,546
and what sort of encounters this Incarnation would have.

30
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:11,210
So, the major propelling force, you can say,

31
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:18,540
the major work had to be done in the Incarnation

32
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:26,300
to create a very strong spinal cord,

33
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:34,180
so that it could bear the Primordial Kundalini,

34
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:46,025
which is responsible for doing this great work of transformation.

35
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,030
Now, this Kundalini, which is the Primordial One,

36
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:09,420
has all the powers built in:

37
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,386
of redemption, of ascent.

38
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,250
But apart from that, to be born in this Kali Yuga,

39
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:41,954
one had to know what sort of people one has to face

40
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:49,220
and then how to bring them round

41
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,300
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

42
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,745
and to the understanding that they have to have their ascent.

43
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:16,809
So, there are many sources of energies and knowledge,

44
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:26,459
which are to be used because it's a very complicated world

45
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:30,724
in which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

46
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,620
It was not a simple thing like people coming to Himalayas.

47
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,649
They were already clean people,

48
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:43,289
very desirous of getting realization.

49
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,500
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions and conditions and ego.

50
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,180
They were completely surrendered

51
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,740
and after a great amount of penance, they would arrive.

52
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:05,619
So to raise their Kundalini was not such a complicated thing.

53
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:12,469
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini

54
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,914
had to give ascent to people,

55
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:20,354
but She had to also understand

56
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,900
what sort of people are there.

57
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,820
Why don't she take out the child? What's the matter?

58
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:42,531
I think, open the windows, perhaps the children are feeling hot.

59
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,140
Normally children don't cry unless and until there is some problem,

60
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,260
You have to be careful.

61
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,012
So, all the aspects of human beings on the random

62
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,935
movement of human beings,

63
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,551
all their adventures and enterprises,

64
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,116
were to be understood

65
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,940
by the Incarnation,

66
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,180
to communicate with the Primordial Kundalini.

67
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,820
And also such a person had to be a Mahamaya

68
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,900
so that She or He, whatever it is,

69
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,000
has to behave in such a manner

70
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,520
that nobody should feel frightened

71
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:50,780
or should feel something disturbed.

72
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,700
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

73
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,596
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double-fold.

74
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,053
First is to know about the present:

75
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,707
the way the people are,

76
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:18,420
their cultures, their styles, their conditionings, their egos, everything,

77
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,980
how they behave.

78
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:23,891
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all these things

79
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:28,450
because She doesn't know. This is human adventure.

80
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,650
She doesn't know how far they have gone

81
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,860
and what do they see, what do they dream, what are their ideas.

82
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:41,220
And the another work is of the Kundalini.

83
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,620
So She's divided into two parts:

84
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,377
one is the Kundalini and another is the Sahasrara.

85
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,820
So, Sahasrara has to supply all the material,

86
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,234
all the information to the Kundalini

87
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,260
and then the Kundalini has to work out.

88
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,980
Of course, as you know very well,

89
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
there are Deities who are built in

90
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:13,795
everywhere in the Sahasrara, also the whole body

91
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,500
and they are the Ones who communicate

92
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,140
whatever has to be communicated properly.

93
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,065
But it's a very complicated work, extremely complicated.

94
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,404
So this Primordial Kundalini

95
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:33,004
acts for

96
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,179
the collective,  Samashti, as well as for the individual.

97
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,180
 Now, supposing you go to

98
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,620
a place like, say, an airport.

99
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,140
So you start absorbing the heat of the people.

100
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,820
Then the perspiration starts and you

101
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,340
have to see that all this work is done through your body.

102
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,100
Or, at the same time, if there's somebody, individual

103
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,660
who has some problem also can be absorbed

104
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,940
and can be corrected.

105
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,780
So, it acts on both levels

106
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,140
one on the individual and one on the collective, as they say

107
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,952
Samashti and Vyashti.

108
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,444
 And simultaneously this can act.

109
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:44,860
Now the attention, which is the power of the sahasrara,

110
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:52,660
  also has to be extremely deep, alert

111
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,620
and intelligible.

112
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,140
All this work had to be done to create

113
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,746
this Incarnation of Primordial Kundalini and the Sahasrara.

114
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:26,933
so many mechanism were used,

115
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:31,700
so many types of wiring was done, as you do it,

116
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,820
like as you try to fix your computer to make it the most efficient one,

117
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,540
in the same way, lot of work was to be put in.

118
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:57,780
And first you had to watch human beings for two thousand years,

119
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,540
how they have been behaving, what they have been doing

120
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,020
and now what sort of human beings are there.

121
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,159
Every nation had different conditionings.

122
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,802
Every individual had different conditioning. It's a very difficult work

123
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,091
and One had to have really the ocean of patience,

124
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,860
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

125
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,220
And that's how

126
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,980
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage was set in.

127
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,260
As you have put the stage here, you have done a marvellous work

128
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,700
and it looks very nice, beautiful, everything is there,

129
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,340
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very complicated one,

130
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,140
extremely complicated.

131
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,700
Because the work was so dynamic,

132
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:22,124
so subtle, at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

133
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:38,676
All the intelligence of the Divine was used

134
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,780
to manufacture this Incarnation.

135
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:58,180
And to get a human realization was also very difficult.

136
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,900
You had to be born like an ordinary human being,

137
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,489
to live in your family like an ordinary person.

138
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,380
You had to find out through entering into everybody's Kundalini

139
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,650
what was wrong with them,

140
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,420
what was the mistake,

141
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,620
how you could use the permutations and combinations

142
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,740
of their chakras to give them en-masse realization.

143
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,511
 It was a tremendous task

144
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:34,446
and that had to be done with the Sahasrara.

145
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,786
But it has been achieved.

146
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:50,740
All these great plans of the Divine

147
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,658
and everybody's detailed working

148
00:19:57,555 --> 00:20:06,020
and bringing everything to a par-excellence level

149
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,139
was really tremendous.

150
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,284
I'm Myself surprised at Myself

151
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,774
and amazed

152
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:23,891
how I could really get so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,780
I didn't expect it,

154
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
but it has worked tremendously,

155
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,140
because of the co-operation of human beings also,

156
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,140
otherwise it would not have been possible.

157
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,820
Now, when you do these pujas and all those things,

158
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,460
you please those Deities, make them happy,

159
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,740
because they have done so much work.

160
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,340
Is your gratitude for them

161
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,940
that they have worked so hard with such diligence,

162
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,700
with such precisions

163
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,340
that today we have been able to achieve this great drama

164
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,780
of Sahaja Yoga.

165
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,240
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps do not realize

166
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,020
what is the great work done in the background

167
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,980
and how much time it took to build up the wholething,

168
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,980
to bring it to this level of perfection.

169
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,460
So the Primordial Kundalini,

170
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,859
which is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

171
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,399
also is of the same nature

172
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,620
and it works in the same way.

173
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:06,860
It rises, gives you Self Realization,

174
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,020
gives you the powers,

175
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,349
but after all one has to know it is a reflection

176
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:28,932
and a reflection to make it truthful, real.

177
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:35,231
You have to look at reality first,

178
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,380
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

179
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,500
the real Primordial One,

180
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,527
how it acts, how it works.

181
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,235
If you start thinking about My Kundalini only,

182
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:58,500
immediately you will become silent, no question.

183
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,060
You cannot think, just you'll become silent.

184
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,220
Just think of any one of My chakras

185
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,940
and your chakras will be all right.

186
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,501
But you have to have that depth.

187
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,852
You have to have that much protocol.

188
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:18,660
You have to have that much right.

189
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,500
Just it will act. Don't have to do anything.

190
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Just you have to think of My chakras.

191
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,020
Just think about My Kundalini. That's sufficient.

192
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,540
But you have to develop that surrendering situation.

193
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,140
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

194
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,620
They have seen the work, they have seen everything, still they doubt

195
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,980
and they yield to people who are on the periphery.

196
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,820
And there are Sahaja Yogis who still

197
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,140
sticking on to many things they cannot change. They haven't got

198
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,126
yet that courage to change themselves.

199
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,612
I don't say that you have to change anything outside,

200
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:03,980
but a time comes you might have to change also,

201
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,140
so you should be prepared.

202
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,660
How much we are courageous, that is to be weighed

203
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,492
and to be found out

204
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,300
Unless and until you have full courage,

205
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,980
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga in a quick way.

206
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,500
When you are using your own Kundalini,

207
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,620
you have to know that the Kundalini that is your own has problems.

208
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,780
She Herself has gone through various ages and stages

209
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,620
and She Herself is sometimes very much hurt,

210
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:49,060
very unhappy and very weak and then She cannot rise.

211
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,300
So, if you want that this Kundalini

212
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,980
that is your own,that is your own Mother

213
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,340
has to give you all the nourishment and everything,

214
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,618
you must learn, first of all,

215
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:05,720
foremost thing, how to surrender to Reality.

216
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,420
So, if you learn how to surrender to the Primordial Kundalini,

217
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,993
then your Kundalini's immediately strengthened.

218
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,140
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

219
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:29,340
and you try to put anything on it, it won't reflect.

220
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:35,060
Then you improve with the wood, still nothing will be reflected.

221
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,300
Then you paint it, some reflection will come.

222
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,700
Then you have the glass. The glass won't reflect.

223
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,140
But if you use some mercury and make it a mirror, it will reflect,

224
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,060
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

225
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,660
So this is how the kind of a reflector you are,

226
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,100
on that depends the kind of a reflection you get

227
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,980
and the kind of personality you develop.

228
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,065
So, there should be no aim as such, but

229
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:15,380
to be dissolved into the Reality,

230
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,619
should be the desire within you.

231
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,180
Start dissolving into it.

232
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,340
Then one does not have to talk about detachment.

233
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,780
One does not have to talk about anything, about any virtues.

234
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,700
They automatically come because now you have become the Divine.

235
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,420
Once you become the Divine, even your Kundalini becomes absolutely,

236
00:26:39,642 --> 00:26:45,122
beautifully, completely reflecting the Primordial One.

237
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,380
So, today I have decided to have this puja

238
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,300
and to tell you about this Primordial Kundalini how

239
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,108
it has been worked out, it has been built in and it has

240
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:04,308
been given so many powers

241
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,660
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

242
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,060
people had to cleanse their chakras, cleanse their

243
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,140
body, cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,

244
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,820
tapas and then they would think of having realization.

245
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,140
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

246
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,580
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done any tapas, nothing.

247
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,820
From the very first day you have been blessed

248
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,684
and you have had blessings

249
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:38,260
and you have been enjoying your blessings throughout.

250
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,380
So that is a temptation. Remember it's a temptation.

251
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,700
Don't get lost with the blessings that you are having.

252
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,620
You have to go further and further and further.

253
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,420
So, it's not a difficult life in Sahaja Yoga at all.

254
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,180
On the contrary, it's very much easier,

255
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,460
but then people start using Sahaja Yoga for certain purposes

256
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,140
which secretly they know

257
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,580
that they are using Sahaja Yoga for this purpose and that purpose.

258
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,780
If you start using Sahaja Yoga for any such purpose,

259
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,834
then again you have a fall,

260
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,660
then again you have to understand that this was a wrong thing

261
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,260
and then again you rise.

262
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,500
So people go like this, up and down, up and down, up and down.

263
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,907
But still, I must say, this realization that is given to you

264
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:27,180
has been given without cleansing you,

265
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,700
without telling you anything, without asking for anything,

266
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:39,659
without any kind  of bondage on you, burden on you

267
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,540
and you got this realization.

268
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,340
But now, immediately after Realization, you are in the bondage

269
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,900
of your Kundalini

270
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,603
and you have to look after Her and you have to look after yourself.

271
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:59,620
Now you have to identify yourself fully with your Kundalini

272
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,540
and then everything works out all right.

273
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,540
So, today is the day when we have to decide

274
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,180
that our greatest weapon as Austria is Astra,

275
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
is Kundalini.

276
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,340
And we should know how to use it,

277
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,820
what mantra's to be used,

278
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,500
what is the problem we have

279
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,060
and we should not be shy of our problem. If we have a problem,

280
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,100
we should know this is our problem, it must be corrected.

281
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:34,804
Also we should know the technique fully.

282
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:38,940
I find that some people knows lot of techniques

283
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,660
and also they know how to give big speeches,

284
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,370
but they are not good in their hearts.

285
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,140
The hearts are not clean.

286
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,811
They want to use their power of speech just to show off

287
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:53,780
their knowledge.

288
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,539
Then there are some people who are, who are such

289
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:03,300
that they are good in vibrations and they want to give vibrations,

290
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,540
but they are afraid and they don't know much about the technique.

291
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,060
So, you have to know all these three things properly,

292
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,020
f you really want to achieve full results of your ascent

293
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,235
and if you want to really transform the world,

294
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:22,140
then you must know you have to be ideal people.

295
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,140
You cannot be problematic people. Now see, yesterday I was surprised

296
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,067
how many people there were sick,

297
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:33,387
how many people were suffering from this or that.

298
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,020
While you should thank your stars that none of you have any sickness,

299
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,835
you are perfectly all right, you don't have bad habits,

300
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,700
you don't have anything. You've just come out of it.

301
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,140
But to go further, you have to have full determination

302
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,660
and understanding that this is a tremendous work

303
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,588
and a tremendous task.

304
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:54,595
And all your powers to be awakened within yourself,

305
00:30:54,795 --> 00:30:57,060
you have to be first of all

306
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,820
fully equipped with readiness,

307
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,739
readiness to serve the Divine.

308
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:08,699
Unless and until you have that readiness,

309
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:13,140
that: "I don't want anything. I don't want. I just want to serve the Divine.”

310
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,483
As long as

311
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:19,700
you are striving for it and asking for it

312
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,740
with full heart, with full sincerity,

313
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,980
then I'm sure this Kundalini will be strengthened

314
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,220
and She'll cleanse you completely

315
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,620
and you'll be one day Mahayogis.

316
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:35,401
May God bless you all.
