1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,400
you

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:33,340
I wonder if he understand the meaning of

3
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:37,909
innocence or not innocence is a quality

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:42,350
which is innate which is which cannot be

5
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:47,269
forced which cannot be trained into it's

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:53,449
just a quality innate quality within a

7
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:57,559
human being maybe you say that innocent

8
00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:02,170
persons are attacked by the cunning by

9
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,619
the accuracy but innocence is such a

10
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,380
great thing that it cannot be distracted

11
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:12,830
with the quality of the Spirit in a

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,490
sense is the quality of the spirit and

13
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:22,210
when they spirit within you is awakened

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:26,509
you get the power of innocence by which

15
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:31,039
you overcome all that is negative all

16
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:35,649
that is wrong all that is detrimental to

17
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:38,780
your growth spiritual understanding

18
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,560
whatever is mine is not all means that's

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,149
not so

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,229
my body my head my everything my but I -

21
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:49,819
give me the same I

22
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:51,890
what is I then I is separated whatever

23
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:55,190
is not mine is I so what remains it's

24
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,780
your spirit somebody gave me this our

25
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,349
limit as it is a very good argument to

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:05,860
work it out and whatever remains is us

27
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:08,599
and that I taste of our we have received

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,270
so you are reducing all these miles

29
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,610
miles miles so the fewer spirit of

30
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,330
innocence we lack

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,390
so the idea of a spirit terms of people

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,620
think that if you become spiritual I

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,770
mean I don't know what people think

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,950
about

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,930
with ten people but I about spiritual

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,650
people is that you have to be something

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:37,500
terrific like a fool or I don't know you

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:41,220
have to be sharp like a fox you have to

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,440
be lecture like Freud or something oh

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,170
it's not so my desk beautifully

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,330
no it is not spiritual person is just

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:54,660
innocent just innocent there's no

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,520
intelligence nothing just innocent the

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,520
more thing is innocence see whatever he

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,250
talks or says comes through innocence it

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,650
doesn't have been clicked as such each

47
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,890
year people are off with Rudy daily and

48
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:13,910
to understanding and realizing nothing

49
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,910
of the time it just has pure innocence

50
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:25,650
it's so clean which is the way to become

51
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:29,600
innocent in sahaja yoga we have a proper

52
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:35,250
method how we can become innocent

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:38,850
it happens through our thoughtless

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,420
awareness if you are in the state of

55
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:46,790
thoughtless awareness then what happens

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:51,330
you do not react do not get involved

57
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,190
into wrong things you do not get

58
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,180
involved into any discussion as

59
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,640
arguments but you just watch and the

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,280
innocence within you Rises beautifully

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,980
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,940
so whatever may be the circumstances

63
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,830
when you are in thoughtless awareness

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,230
you do not react that is the sign of

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,370
innocence and people who do not react

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:24,210
keep young they will never show their

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,930
age they keep young because to react is

68
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:33,820
not

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:37,780
a very good thing which makes you get

70
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:41,680
involved into another person but if you

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,900
don't react if you are just watching oh

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,300
you're a witness then you don't get

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,389
involved into anything you are away from

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:55,240
it and that's how your innocence grooves

75
00:04:49,389 --> 00:05:02,349
and you get very confident I've read a

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:08,770
story about a Chinese king who went to a

77
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:13,870
saint and asked him that he wants some

78
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:17,949
boon problems what he said I want my son

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:21,520
to be developed into a person who can

80
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:24,849
face all kinds of whatever people may do

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,870
he should be able to face them soon all

82
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:31,090
right we leave your son with me

83
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,330
so when the argument started when the

84
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,550
fighting started his son was just timing

85
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,130
straight watching everything thoughtless

86
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:46,840
of it so everybody from the arena went

87
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:51,250
back they all went away and they

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,550
couldn't stand the innocence of this boy

89
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,240
who was very young and the king was

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,659
surprised how his son could face all of

91
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,659
them all their arguments all their

92
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:07,449
aggression and all kinds of horrible

93
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:12,580
things I said if anybody says anything

94
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:14,530
to you you should just be innocent at

95
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,449
that time you have power of innocence

96
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:23,409
will show that this person who is trying

97
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:27,039
to dominate you to trouble you is very

98
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,050
much in the wrong I told you innocence

99
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,220
is the spirit and spirit is the English

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:37,780
which cannot be destroyed by the fact is

101
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:40,389
that it cannot be destroyed by anything

102
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,600
and it can be reestablished through

103
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:46,120
sahaja yoga you might have been a very

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,910
aggressive person you might have been a

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,980
very unhappy person you must have been a

106
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,520
person who is all the time disturbing

107
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,040
others maybe but after sahaja yoga you

108
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,980
can make your personality so sweet and

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:05,410
beautiful that not only you can enjoy

110
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:10,260
but others can also in this scene

111
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:16,000
essence is something which is absolute

112
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:24,280
Oreste intelligence it is not that it

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,580
works for the purpose some purpose but

114
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,330
this is purposeless it's absolutely

115
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:34,510
purposeless and thus it achieves that

116
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:38,740
height of joy because there is no

117
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:42,450
purpose in anything it sees the futility

118
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,760
of all kinds of endeavors that we have

119
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,979
it just enjoy why people are running up

120
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,950
and down why are they fighting this time

121
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:53,950
suffer sees that why should they do it

122
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,810
like that some may think they are all

123
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,680
right there's nothing wrong with them

124
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:03,940
but it's not so in a sense is something

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,710
I told you is a innate quality and you

126
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,120
should not deceive yourself by thinking

127
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,669
you are innocent on the contrary you

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,669
just put some introspection upon

129
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:19,090
yourself and see for yourself what have

130
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:23,140
you been doing so far as far as other

131
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:26,460
servants what is your attitude see

132
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,530
children how they are source of it

133
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,469
anybody who comes on the stage and runs

134
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,020
about how we enjoy why why do we enjoy a

135
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,810
child running about we don't say he's

136
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,870
gone amok or he's drunk but we enjoy the

137
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,380
child why what is the sweetness of that

138
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,350
child that makes us so happy because

139
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,580
that's innocence

140
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,730
his power is innocence at that power he

141
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,930
is just looking so sweet so beautiful

142
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,480
that it gives us the real joy within so

143
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:05,520
the second thing is that innocence is

144
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,540
jointly innocence gives joy to people

145
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,170
anything

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,470
sets innocently anything done innocently

147
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,270
is very very joy-giving

148
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:23,640
and in that you you see the person so

149
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:29,390
transparent so beautiful that you enjoy

150
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:32,220
that transparency and that sanctified

151
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,220
innocence if you want to have real joy

152
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,810
then have innocent love between yourself

153
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,550
and enjoy it

154
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,550
may God thank

155
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,090
you
