1
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,171
If you don't hear me this time please tell me.

2
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,516
I am sorry for being late,

3
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,869
for this lecture

4
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,575
but,

5
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:13,127
Dr. Warren had time to explain to you,

6
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:16,252
about this experience.

7
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:20,489
Sometimes it is easier to understand

8
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,989
this from a person,

9
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,489
who has achieved it,

10
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,121
than to understand from a person

11
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,712
who is talking from some tenth storey.

12
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,462
That's what my father told me,

13
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:38,370
that if somebody's born on the tenth storey,

14
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,860
and the rest of them are on the first floor,

15
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,909
if you start telling them from there they will first of all not listen,

16
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,735
nor will they understand what you see.

17
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,688
It's not proper,

18
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:57,081
that we should try to tell them something from a level,

19
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,374
to a level, which is still there static,

20
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,615
in their mind.

21
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:07,341
So one has to, raise their, consciousness,

22
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:11,558
two three storeys so they start seeing that there's something beyond.

23
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:16,923
But, in doing so,

24
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,154
so many mistakes,

25
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:25,486
have been, there, before,

26
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,363
and some people have done it deliberately,

27
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,035
some are misguided

28
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,488
and some are doing it deliberately.

29
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,441
Net result is just the same.

30
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:40,261
Even if you give poison to someone by mistake,

31
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:45,417
or in a misguided way, the result is the same.

32
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,500
In the same way,

33
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
whether you are misguided,

34
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,255
or whether you do it deliberately, whatever is wrong

35
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:56,647
has an effect on the kundalini.

36
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:00,764
Now the Aquarian Age,

37
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,841
is the word I picked up from Dr. Warren,

38
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,255
which is so true today.

39
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,294
Aquarian means the water carrier,

40
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,383
and in Sanskrit language it is called as kumbha.

41
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:17,484
Kumbha is the one what we call the kundalini,

42
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,138
the mooladhara is the kumbha,

43
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,641
where the kundalini is there, the power of kundalini is there.

44
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,848
So to call it an Aquarian age must be some,

45
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:32,554
work of some, realized soul who could see that,

46
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,656
in this age the kundalini is going to be awakened,

47
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:42,527
and that, an age will start of people getting their kundalini awakened.

48
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:47,363
Now I have already talked to you the other day about

49
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,052
this second center, which is called as swadhisthana,

50
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:54,073
which gives us our sustenance

51
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:56,573
and also our power to create.

52
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,667
The sustenance is created inside,

53
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,515
that green part, which is,

54
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,552
represented by main ten Primordial Masters,

55
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:13,440
and these ten Primordial Masters had another

56
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,786
series of masters who were called as,

57
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,963
Disciple Principles.

58
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,478
Now about these people I have talked to you last time,

59
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,577
but today I would like to speak to you

60
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:29,310
about other centers, specially this nabhi,

61
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,829
which is the navel centre which is very important in human beings.

62
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:40,139
This is the centre by which we seek.

63
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:44,206
When in amoeba stage we seek,

64
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,855
food, at a higher level

65
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,246
we start seeking heights,

66
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:54,728
like when they became mammoth and all these

67
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,228
animals they wanted to have a height,

68
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:02,277
to go over the trees to be able to master them and to eat the leaves,

69
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:05,693
but they became so much outsized with their height,

70
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:08,519
that they had to become smaller animals,

71
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,189
like say intelligent animals,

72
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:16,194
and, like say cats and things like that, cat family.

73
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,554
And this is how the evolution has been,

74
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,369
brought forth through our seeking as amoeba,

75
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,632
then as animals and now as human beings.

76
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,856
As we have evolved higher and higher,

77
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:37,536
we have become subtler and subtler in our seeking.

78
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:42,155
For example the people who are seeking say power,

79
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:48,260
are not so evolved as people who are seeking their spirit, no doubt about it.

80
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,156
Because you have gone through that, you have had enough of it.

81
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,083
Maybe last lives you might have been kings and queens

82
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,522
and you must have seen all the jokes of it,

83
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,831
so you said now, it's had enough of it,

84
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:01,146
this power business, we don't want to have anymore,

85
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,344
such a headache we don't want to have.

86
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:06,565
The people who are seeking money also,

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,378
are the people who have had enough of it

88
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,856
and they were fed up of it so they said now we have had it.

89
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:16,645
So now you are seekers of, something beyond.

90
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:19,778
It has been always so, something beyond we seek,

91
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:23,686
but this seeking beyond is not described

92
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:27,495
to so many people and they are not able to understand

93
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,297
what is the beyond, that's why this center is very important,

94
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:33,474
of your evolutionary process.

95
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:41,196
Now, first of all as I have told you that we have to be in balance,

96
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,651
that's one thing we must have is the balance in life.

97
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,225
I mean in commonsense also we can see supposing there's

98
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,251
a car going only on one wheel,

99
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,363
how many would like to travel by that.

100
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:57,189
Anything that you do in life has to have a balance,

101
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:01,829
otherwise, anything, even catching something, holding something

102
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:07,408
or, small small things, even riding a bicycle

103
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:09,777
you know that you have to have a balance.

104
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,606
So if the kundalini has to move,

105
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:15,304
you have to be a balanced personality,

106
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,502
a personality with a temperate,

107
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:23,201
nature and must have a balanced attitude towards life.

108
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,615
That is very important, but in case it is not,

109
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:30,645
you can be sucked into the central path of the sushumna,

110
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,843
in the central path of your evolution.

111
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:36,557
Now the evolution takes place by remaining in the central path.

112
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:40,054
Those who go to the extremes fall out of this.

113
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:45,540
Now the virus that we suffer from very commonly,

114
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,595
is nothing but a kind of a vegetable

115
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,707
which is fallen out of evolution.

116
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:55,580
Now the vegetable that we call as tobacco,

117
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,516
is going to fall out of complete evolution and you'll be surprised after

118
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,189
some years you will not find

119
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,970
any tobacco growing anywhere because it will go out of evolution,

120
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:12,595
thanks to human beings that they misunderstood the role of tobacco.

121
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,022
Tobacco is an insecticide, is to be used

122
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,703
for killing the insects and not to kill yourself.

123
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,691
But, we sometimes forget, that whatever,

124
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,838
God has created for the good,

125
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:30,996
sometimes we can use it for our destruction.

126
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,458
Same is alcohol. Alcohol was created for polishing,

127
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,613
it's very good for example if you have to polish your crystal,

128
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:41,508
you should use gin is very good,

129
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,039
for diamonds or anything.

130
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:50,361
Is just a polish, it's a polish for the,

131
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,288
for anything, it gives a polish. You see alcohol is a polish and

132
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:58,533
its composition is such that it gives a polish to a thing.

133
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:02,483
Now God wanted you to have polished surfaces and polished things

134
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,805
and all the clean look of it so He gave you this polish.

135
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,674
Now you started drinking it, now what to do.

136
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:15,457
He never asked you to drink, but if you drink that,

137
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,068
then it polishes your intestines also.

138
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,940
But it has its own nature. It doesn't have any

139
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:26,427
idea of morality, poor thing what, we can't blame the alcohol,

140
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:30,917
because it is suppose to polish, wherever you put it it polishes all right,

141
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,842
so it polishes your liver also nicely.

142
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:41,892
And when the liver is nicely polished then what happens

143
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,305
that the heat from the liver,

144
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:48,091
which is for the expulsion from the body,

145
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,814
it has to pass into the bloodstream, cannot because there's a,

146
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,377
barrier and because of that barrier

147
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:56,941
poor liver does not know what to do.

148
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:00,599
It just goes on accumulating all the heat within it

149
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:05,714
and that's how your liver goes out of circulation of anything,

150
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:10,207
and you have liver problems and you feel very giddy, nauseated,

151
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:14,825
and liver is the one which really cleanses your attention.

152
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:18,148
Whatever you gather from your attention it cleanses.

153
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:23,237
So you become horrid I mean you are all the time angry,

154
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:26,783
hot-tempered, you bark at people all the time,

155
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:31,612
all that thing is typically liverish you see. We grow tall,

156
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,439
like that absolutely straight line, and

157
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:38,996
you become very hot-tempered. Sometimes you could be hawk-like you know,

158
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:42,131
people will be afraid of going nearer such a person,

159
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,474
because such a person can be very dry personality

160
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:47,251
and that's why you'll find,

161
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:50,739
drunkard people if you they're over-drunk you go near them they'll just

162
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,094
beat you for nothing at all. I mean

163
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,403
it sometimes happens that by chance

164
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,877
if you go and ask some drunkard that: 'What's the time?' in the night

165
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,062
you will have it.

166
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,083
So, because it spoils your awareness

167
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,230
and in that awareness a nice man also could be like that,

168
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:15,004
but of course there could be a case where a person might become better.

169
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:17,890
That is also another thing that can happen

170
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:20,389
when you get possessed by this

171
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:23,394
left-side movement because alcohol reduces

172
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,886
your awareness and you go to the left-side movement to the left side,

173
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:30,966
may give you, a feeling 'Oh I'm very much better now'

174
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:35,850
and sort of you get happy because your ego is subsided and everything is

175
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:39,922
alright and 'I'm really moderate now, I cannot hit anyone

176
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:42,343
and let me have little bit and sleep off'.

177
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:44,824
But next day there's a hangover

178
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,963
and you feel so horrible with it,

179
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,314
that you don't know what to do, I mean

180
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,814
it's something, then again you want to have it in the night

181
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,425
because you want to again go to the same realm into the left side.

182
00:13:55,925 --> 00:14:00,126
Now this left side realm, apparently shows that there is

183
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:05,513
reduction in the weight of the ego, but it does not, it wobbles.

184
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,203
What happens that you go to the superego on the left hand side you see there,

185
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:14,905
and the ego then thinks that it has gone down because the superego

186
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:19,671
increases in size. But when superego increases, the ego is pushed down

187
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:23,888
and then when you come to your ego condition,

188
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:26,523
then it pushes down so there's a big wobbling going on,

189
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:29,627
and such people get ultimately very much confused.

190
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:33,082
They might end up in a lunatic asylum I don't know what they do,

191
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:39,516
but, when they are even sane you can find they lose the grip over life,

192
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:43,709
for example such people can become very frivolous, and

193
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,957
cannot feel the joy of life without drinking.

194
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:52,509
It's most amazing that people can't enjoy each other unless and until

195
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:57,752
there's a glass in between. I mean human beings are so beautiful,

196
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:03,508
and they have the capacity to enjoy each other, so much,

197
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:08,420
they are the only ones who are blessed more than anybody else.

198
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,533
But if there's a glass all the time in between

199
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:14,033
then they can just bark at each other,

200
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:16,382
they cannot enjoy each other.

201
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:20,655
The enjoyment should be complete when there's nothing in between.

202
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,265
Now this is what I was telling you, this nahbi chakra.

203
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:30,135
This nahbi chakra gets, ruined also when we take to,

204
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:33,685
alcohols or serious things like that, drugs and,

205
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,336
even I've seen certain medicines can spoil this.

206
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:40,096
Then you get a problem with the other things like digestion,

207
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,674
you get constipation, all sorts of things take place,

208
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:44,983
by which you develop

209
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:48,682
gas troubles and other troubles and then your heart troubles and it

210
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,860
goes on one after another.

211
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,953
I do not say that it's only alcohol that will cause.

212
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:58,370
There are other causes also, but alcohol can never be helpful,

213
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,850
in giving you good health. Some people

214
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,300
have a feeling that if you take alcohol then only you will keep good health.

215
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,291
Is a wrong thing. Because health is not only physical health.

216
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:12,784
It's also mental health. People think that

217
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,269
physical health is the end of everything,

218
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:20,445
is absolutely wrong because we are not only the physical being.

219
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,367
We are also the mental being and the emotional being.

220
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,298
And when you play too much with your nahbi chakra

221
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:30,294
you have the biggest problem and that is that

222
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:33,943
you can never be successful in life

223
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,522
as far as enjoyment is concerned, of your achievements.

224
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,965
For example a person becomes rich,

225
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,877
unduly rich he becomes, is a blessing

226
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:46,595
I should say of nahbi chakra on the right-hand side.

227
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:52,439
Right-hand side nahbi chakra can give you a lot of wealth,

228
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:57,941
a lot of money and you'll have ten cars and fifteen people attending to you,

229
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:01,349
everything you may have but, it cannot,

230
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,618
it cannot give you the satisfaction of life.

231
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:10,424
You will go on accumulating and end up with a suicide or something like that

232
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,558
and you would not know why you are

233
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:14,388
bent upon committing suicide.

234
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,888
That's why in all affluent countries you find

235
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,194
people are planning to commit suicide

236
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,963
and the more affluent they are the worse it is.

237
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:26,116
But the left side gets completely dried.

238
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,299
Now the left side is the centre of

239
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,476
the family life, the Gruhalaxshmi,

240
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,545
the Goddess of the family,

241
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,648
the household you see.

242
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,425
A person who runs after money too much,

243
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:44,565
forgets his family. He has no time for his family.

244
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:47,115
The husband and wife may meet somewhere

245
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:48,689
on the airport

246
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:52,472
or may just wave at each other sometimes you see, crossing each other,

247
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,735
or the children suffer the most.

248
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:58,583
And in that case the women also then take up with the men,

249
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:03,502
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

250
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
and in so doing so,

251
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,770
when they compete with each other,

252
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:11,619
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

253
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,089
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

254
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:18,085
her ego is not satisfied. In olden times

255
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,262
the man used to go in the jungle,

256
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,067
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

257
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,352
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

258
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,287
There was no problem because there was barter system.

259
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,334
He could see her working in the household.

260
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,229
Now the husband earns the money

261
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:36,244
and the woman spends. I mean that also requires some work,

262
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,652
isn't it to spend the money.

263
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,998
But to man it looks like, that I'm the earning member and she's the spender.

264
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:47,374
So she said all right, I will also earn. But in this too much of competition,

265
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:50,133
too much of competition like this, between the two,

266
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,564
what happens, the family suffers, the children suffer

267
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:57,063
and such a person will have problem with the wife, the wife will have

268
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:01,755
problem with the husband and you can always feel that center on this finger,

269
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,116
if that finger is catching, that means there's something wrong

270
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,927
with your family relationship,

271
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,883
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

272
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:17,012
It's an important thing. Because you are like the flowers

273
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,059
which have to produce a fruit.

274
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,781
That's what nature wants.

275
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:23,699
Nature wants that you are there to produce the,

276
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,719
fruit, that is your children.

277
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:32,161
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

278
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,296
Now, if you think that

279
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:39,397
with that responsibility if you can do something else you should do.

280
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,035
But the main thing is that,

281
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:44,910
and if you don't do that, is to look after your children, to give them joy,

282
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,022
have a beautiful nest for them,

283
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:50,800
then I must say that you are neglecting your basic duty

284
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:53,300
and your attention is on something else.

285
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:57,348
That's why so many divorces are taking place and problems are there,

286
00:19:57,503 --> 00:20:00,145
the women ask for their rights, they go beyond their limits,

287
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:02,840
they became dominating here, the men become dominating.

288
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,932
That's not the way we are going to solve it.

289
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,282
We have to know that we are two wheels,

290
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:09,329
two wheels of one chariot,

291
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
one on the left, another in the right.

292
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Now they are not similar,

293
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,343
they're not similar they are two types one left side one right side.

294
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,692
But, they are equal.

295
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,090
In their, whatever they do it's equal,

296
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,331
they are to be respected equally in the same manner.

297
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:28,615
And it is always so for example,

298
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,527
I had a girl who came to me

299
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:33,811
and she was a private secretary,

300
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,117
and she told me: 'Mother you say this,

301
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,436
but I've seen that all these men come and flirt with their private secretaries.'

302
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,019
So I said: 'All right, maybe so, but what does that matter.'

303
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,950
You see that shows that's something wrong with the man, he

304
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:47,780
doesn't understand, he's off his head, he

305
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:50,240
cannot enjoy his wife and he's running after other things.

306
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,026
It's like having something in your house and you are

307
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:54,793
looking at other things you see.

308
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,360
Like in India if you go to some,

309
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,269
somebody comes to your house be careful about your things,

310
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,921
but in England I tell them, if somebody comes to your house

311
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,997
be careful about your wife, see.

312
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,879
Is just a little difference between,

313
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:13,020
but the second one is a dangerous thing because fundamental,

314
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,961
the wife is the fundamental thing,

315
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:18,180
because you do not know what she will do, how she will react

316
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:22,474
and you do not know how the guests because that is regarded as their freedom.

317
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:26,297
But if you take away something from somebody's house that's not freedom,

318
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,388
because we can take away anything from somebody's house

319
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,961
why should anybody arrest us?

320
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:33,376
Because there is a free will for you to do what you like,

321
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:36,642
is allowed to do what you like, but in that free will

322
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:40,384
you are harming so many people and ultimately your society.

323
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,635
Now these two wheels, as I said,

324
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,376
are very important to God,

325
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:51,511
because so many great people want to take birth on this earth.

326
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:55,658
So many great souls want to take birth on this earth,

327
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,158
and if we behave in such a manner,

328
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,459
that all the time this chariot is this way going up and that way going up,

329
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,161
I can tell you no child would be willing

330
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,586
to be born in this place who are great people.

331
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,984
Only the people who are of the worst type will be born,

332
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:16,549
they'll be hooligans, they'll be horrible people with a horrid nature

333
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,008
and they'll spoil the whole atmosphere of the countries

334
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:23,772
where husband wife have, do not have good relationship.

335
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,272
The children will be such hooligans

336
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:28,384
and such horrible things

337
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:33,117
that you'll be surprised that at the age of eight years and five years

338
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:34,989
they'll be committing murders and doing

339
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,699
all kinds of such thing that you'll be shocked.

340
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:41,406
Now between you and me,

341
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,205
because you are also husbands and wife and,

342
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,705
one thing it should be there that

343
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:50,959
we should not quarrel before our children.

344
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:55,512
We should have all decency of husband and wife, there are so many things

345
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,753
we do not do in the presence of our children.

346
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:00,443
In the same way we need not sit down and

347
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,943
quarrel and say: 'I hate you and I hate you'.

348
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:07,361
I tell you this is something you have to change little bit in our language.

349
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,823
In India if somebody says: 'I hate you'

350
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,787
it's regarded, that man regarded as a most unmannerly person.

351
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:16,454
I mean its very bad manners to say 'I hate you' how,

352
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:19,842
I mean it shows that you are very low type of person to say like that.

353
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,544
But 'I hate you' so what.

354
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,044
If you hate so what, you are not God.

355
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,716
If you hate me what does it matter, actually,

356
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,388
if somebody hates someone, so what.

357
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:34,283
That shows that person is not a good person, just to hate someone.

358
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:38,418
'I hate you' is a way of expressing something

359
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:44,177
that is I feel, is very wrong for the family system. It shocks children.

360
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:47,639
Children look upon you as ideals.

361
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:49,542
When they are born you should see them,

362
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:52,753
most of the children nowadays in Australia are born realized,

363
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:56,111
I see them around when I went to the airport and I see they're born realized.

364
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,368
And they watch you, and they're surprised

365
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,476
and they sulk and they feel very sad.

366
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,303
They don't like, they don't take sides,

367
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,935
they don't like the father to fight the mother, the mother to fight.

368
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:09,098
And one other thing which you must understand,

369
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:11,598
that a certain gradation has to be there.

370
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:14,759
A woman is the strongest point of the household.

371
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,805
Like this Mother Earth is.

372
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,658
She takes all the problems upon Herself.

373
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,916
She, because She's the strongest.

374
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:25,994
Who else can withstand this kind of, weight on Her.

375
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:27,665
It's the Mother only can do that.

376
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:30,769
In the same way a woman in the house is the mother,

377
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,490
and she has to bear.

378
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,485
You see it's nice to have a husband

379
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,762
who comes home and says whatever he likes

380
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,852
and takes out all the filth on you,

381
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:41,800
than to have a husband who is very sweet, hello, hello

382
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:45,412
and outside he goes like a bumptious tiger on everyone.

383
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:52,022
Such a man is, has to be, he has to, you see they're like children I would say,

384
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:56,377
they are like children. They have to take out their tensions on their wives only,

385
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,748
and you should be an absorber of that

386
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,349
and that's the sign of a woman.

387
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,954
A strong woman doesn't get easily disturbed by these things.

388
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,137
She's not bothered. She says all right,

389
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,526
you little baby come along,

390
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,084
now I have had four babies, now this is the fifth one

391
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:11,721
which is the smallest has come.

392
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,685
Let him shout and scream, even with the children,

393
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:17,649
you have to be patient, they'll hit you, they'll do anything.

394
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,243
I would say that way in India, children are treated

395
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,351
very kindly and they are special things.

396
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:24,648
They will do what they like when they are children,

397
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,335
but when they grow up we do not have teenage problem,

398
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,967
we do not have problem where the children don't respect.

399
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,896
In that, this is very important

400
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:36,070
aspect of our modern life

401
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:40,386
that we have to understand, what is the relationship of husband and wife is.

402
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:45,482
Husband is like say, a gentleman who

403
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:48,383
is definitely is to be respected by the wife.

404
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:51,202
But if she does not respect the husband she cannot

405
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,772
get respect from her children.

406
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,029
But the husband has to be respectable man,

407
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:58,526
that's very important. If the man is not respectable, he

408
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,128
cannot be respected easily.

409
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,259
But the more is the woman has to be very respectable,

410
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:05,983
if she doesn't give her respect,

411
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:08,184
you can handle any kind of man

412
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:12,625
if you are clever enough, drunkards, all sorts, they come round.

413
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,843
Because after all they're human beings, they're not bad people.

414
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:19,565
But because of mishandling they just get out

415
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,104
and the domination of men is just a myth.

416
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,568
See, they cannot dominate,

417
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:29,328
they're incapable of domination. They just do it because they want to

418
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
feel that they are superior, that's all.

419
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:34,658
But they cannot dominate. Whatever domination, what is their domination,

420
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,300
is little little things here and there.

421
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,427
Just like children, that's what it is.

422
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:42,113
If women understand their maturity and their,

423
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,249
their responsibility as women, because they are the shakti,

424
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,562
they are the power of the family,

425
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:53,906
and they are the potent shakti for the husband as well as for the children,

426
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,464
but if they get disturbed

427
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,312
then the husband is disturbed and children are also disturbed.

428
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:02,676
But they are potent, while the kinetics are these people.

429
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:04,766
Like here is the electricity, all right,

430
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:07,435
so we say very good, lamp and electricity and all that,

431
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:10,423
but from where does it come. The source is somewhere

432
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,569
quietly sending the source,

433
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,069
and enjoying itself by giving that source.

434
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:17,731
In the same way this is a very important centre.

435
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,183
Why I said it because today I went,

436
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,889
went to Melbourne and all the time this finger was burning up to this point.

437
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,146
So that means there's something wrong with

438
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:32,276
men and women as far as their family life is concerned.

439
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:34,214
They're all very upset I felt.

440
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,138
The husband is upset and the women.

441
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,906
Maybe the laws maybe against men, maybe here

442
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
I don't know. But in America I found

443
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:43,717
a husband and wife relationship is very queer.

444
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:47,314
For example I met a lady, very queer people they are.

445
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:52,597
I went and stayed with a lady she had a luxurious house

446
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:55,136
with a swimming pool and this and that,

447
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:59,783
a maid in coming to do everything up and five storeys and this,

448
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:04,491
and she said: 'You see my, one of my former husbands

449
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:08,662
will come and see you in Los Angeles.' I said: 'All right very good idea'.

450
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:12,560
So he came, he was like a pauper you know walking like this,

451
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:16,516
and he says: 'I have got a room on rents where I'm staying Mother,

452
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:19,586
 it's very difficult, I have to share it with someone'. I said: 'What?

453
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,291
That lady who was there,

454
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,715
she has a very big house, she's supposed to be your wife'.

455
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,701
He said: 'That's mine, I tell you, I lost it to her in a case'.

456
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,089
I said: 'How could you lose that in a case?'

457
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:35,157
'Because she asked for a divorce and because

458
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,526
she found guilty out of me something some,

459
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,060
so she got it'. And she married three husbands, all the three husbands

460
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,932
are moving like paupers, and this lady's very rich.

461
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:51,597
If you marry seven husbands, seven husbands are finished forever

462
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:55,087
but the lady is so rich, seven times more than any one of them.

463
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:58,094
So this is kind of a law I don't understand.

464
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,505
First of all why there should be a law, I don't understand,

465
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,031
between husband and wife.

466
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,809
I just don't understand. I mean we don't have such laws in India but

467
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,713
everybody cares for the wife,

468
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:11,098
because she is the nearest and the dearest person they have.

469
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,243
Who else to depend? If the woman is dedicated and devoted to husband,

470
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:19,225
do you think he'll run after any other woman, he has to come back to her.

471
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,509
You see he'll be so fed up with these

472
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,993
women who just live for money or anything

473
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,304
and he has to come back.

474
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:28,600
So you see one has to take a very wise decision,

475
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,561
because you must understand you are born at a juncture,

476
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:36,720
whether in, on which you will be destroyed completely,

477
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,608
or you'll be saved completely. Is a very important thing.

478
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,994
You have to save humanity. You are born

479
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:46,756
at a time when you have to save humanity.

480
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:49,762
It's not only kundalini awakening

481
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,115
that will help, because you might be saved,

482
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,982
but you have to save the whole society,

483
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,948
the whole family, the whole,

484
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,476
I should say the whole universe or the whole

485
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,547
creation will have no meaning if you people are destroyed.

486
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:06,434
Now you, this is one of the way of destruction,

487
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,519
 by destroying the family. The children become mad,

488
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:10,815
the husband becomes mad,

489
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,527
they all end up in orphanages, that's what I've seen,

490
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,854
they are mostly in orphanages in their old age,

491
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,528
there's nobody to bother about you.

492
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:21,703
So it's a question of giving, and giving and giving.

493
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:27,334
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

494
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,263
and the another is Raja Laxshmi centre is on the right-hand side.

495
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:36,228
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

496
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,993
and we become very, in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

497
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:45,360
 and we can become very very, sort of authoritative and we might,

498
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:50,290
sort of end up with a funeral with ten thousand people behind us,

499
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:55,939
all bought from market and put there behind you without any feelings,

500
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,393
that's all finished. With such a man finished they'll say, oh thank God he died,

501
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:02,213
he was a horrible terror for us.

502
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,846
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

503
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:09,674
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

504
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:16,476
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance,

505
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,783
lead a very balanced life,

506
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:21,283
by which we are satisfied.

507
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:24,704
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi also one

508
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:27,698
should understand this power is a Lady,

509
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:31,950
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols

510
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:34,042
which suggest that,

511
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:40,055
these symbols are carved out with such deep significance.

512
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:45,013
She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

513
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:50,013
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus.

514
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:54,866
It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.

515
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,793
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car,

516
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,214
loudly, because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

517
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:08,516
and a rich man must go in a big limousine or some sort of

518
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,907
a thing to show off that he's very rich.

519
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:13,903
If he comes to any program, or any he must sit in front,

520
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,847
he should have the front seat,

521
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:19,399
and he makes him known everywhere everybody must feel

522
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:22,536
the weight of the rich man. He can run away with ten wives,

523
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:25,998
of somebody and, he can have a big

524
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:30,019
boat for himself, and he can get any number of women there

525
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:33,115
and he can spoil any families he likes because he's rich.

526
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:38,320
This kind of thing comes in in people but Laxshmi the One who has,

527
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,434
stands on the lotus,

528
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:45,280
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

529
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:47,794
that God has given that person.

530
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:53,537
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are

531
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:58,626
lotus flowers again. Now the lotus is regarded as a very

532
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,192
holy flower in India, because it is so receptive

533
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:09,505
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

534
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:12,938
it is born in the mud. Just think of it,

535
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:17,862
in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out,

536
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,165
the lotus is born.

537
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:24,262
And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance

538
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,541
to the whole atmosphere,

539
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:28,373
and kills all that's filth and everything,

540
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,875
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

541
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,885
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

542
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:39,496
That's what is the lotus for. But this lotus

543
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:44,561
is a pink lotus, means pink, you know is the sign of love.

544
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,268
Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have

545
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:51,795
tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.

546
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:55,628
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice

547
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:01,051
and a, I don't know what do you call that, the bee, the black bee,

548
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:06,309
a very big one which has got horrible,

549
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:11,807
no, the black bee, it's like that, which has got

550
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,372
angular legs and things like that, horrible, you cannot touch it.

551
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:18,868
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

552
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:23,589
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals and takes it inside

553
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:28,577
and makes it, sleep on the corona that it has, very soft

554
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:31,010
one on the bed, and covers it nicely

555
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:34,622
and gives it a nice, you see,

556
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,510
swinging feeling, that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

557
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:43,232
and it sleeps off. Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

558
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:48,013
Now the man who is a laxshmipati the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

559
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,972
has to have a temperament like that.

560
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,106
Anybody who comes to his house,

561
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:59,129
anyone, should be very readily accepted. I've seen people like that,

562
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:02,046
I've seen in my lifetime, should be accepted and they should be

563
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:06,375
very gratified to have such people in the house

564
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,130
and should feel that oh God,

565
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:11,051
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

566
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:14,788
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

567
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:16,902
how to avoid guests,

568
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,644
guests are equal to pests.

569
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:26,715
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills and

570
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:28,687
we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

571
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:31,409
quite good bungalows I should say, there were seven bungalows.

572
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:34,436
And poor husbands were taken to tasks

573
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,584
for mowing the lawns and everything and the wife used to

574
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,267
tell them now come along do it properly

575
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:39,737
and the polishing of the,

576
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,917
brass whatever was there and everything was done very well.

577
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:46,302
But I didn't see even a rat enter those houses,

578
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:49,102
even a rat, I mean leave alone human beings.

579
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:53,358
Nothing entered those houses, only these two persons used to come out

580
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:54,362
and go in.

581
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,794
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

582
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:00,015
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

583
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:05,163
But nobody, while My house was naturally, I am like this,

584
00:36:05,234 --> 00:36:09,468
so it was open all the time, people would come in and go out and this and that

585
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:11,603
and I was just enjoying their company.

586
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:12,727
And one day they asked me,

587
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,295
what's the matter in Your house, all the time people are

588
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:18,605
coming and going and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

589
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,481
I said nothing, just they come, have tea and go, that's all, just

590
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:25,340
some talk together, some rapport of love.

591
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,324
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

592
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:30,370
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

593
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:35,198
and they are, they like to be together, there is a togetherness in them.

594
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:39,395
But with all this, if you cannot have togetherness,

595
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,486
to enjoy your wealth with others,

596
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:43,471
then what's the use of all the wealth.

597
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:45,626
If you have wealth, you'll go for horse-racing,

598
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,520
that's also your own enjoyment.

599
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:51,132
If you have wealth you will do something else which is so individualistic.

600
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,221
You cannot enjoy your wealth

601
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,291
unless and until you share it.

602
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,532
As I told you the other day that

603
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:02,200
I am, a capitalist in the sense I have all the powers within myself.

604
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:06,247
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

605
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:09,345
so I am the greatest communist, because I just cannot enjoy,

606
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,740
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

607
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:15,127
and today my husband was so insistent that I should come back soon,

608
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:18,735
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still, and then I'll come.'

609
00:37:18,955 --> 00:37:22,459
So unless and until you share this love after realization,

610
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:25,049
you do not enjoy. All isms drop out,

611
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:27,785
because you become combination of both extremes,

612
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,167
and you just start enjoying yourself.

613
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,387
Now this lotus is in the hand

614
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:37,820
and another hand that the Goddess has is like this. She has four hands,

615
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:39,114
and one hand like this.

616
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,377
Now this hand that is like this means,

617
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:48,353
you see with this we must give, we must give, we must be generous.

618
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:52,296
Miserly people cannot be the blessed ones,

619
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:56,998
they cannot be. Miserly rich is the horridest thing that you could think of.

620
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,369
Mean, if you see a miserly person,

621
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:03,502
I mean, I don't know, I get a headache with a man like that, you see, who

622
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,763
goes on counting each and every pi

623
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,994
and measuring everything, you see miserly horrible things

624
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,712
and ultimately when they die, their children

625
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,061
take out all their money and just spend it over.

626
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,269
They have, miserly people have another way of

627
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,316
getting their money looted. For example

628
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,025
a thief might come in, if not thief then,

629
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,094
their children will become very wayward

630
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:28,603
or something will happen,

631
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:32,231
they will get sick and they'll have hand brokens and

632
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:35,022
feet broken or something, and they will have to spend money.

633
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:40,039
So the miserly people are such a nuisance to the society.

634
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,458
They give nothing to the society they are

635
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:45,785
there for themselves and they are just malignant personalities.

636
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,285
The people who give,

637
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,159
not of course I don't believe into giving

638
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,199
into somebody freely because that also can spoil people.

639
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:57,856
If you give something to someone very freely,

640
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,903
they can be completely spoilt and,

641
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:03,202
they would not know how to use that money.

642
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:05,573
This is the trouble with human beings is,

643
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,707
that they cannot bear anything.

644
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,956
If you give them money,

645
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,630
either they'll become miserly or they become wayward.

646
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:15,068
If you give them power either they become dictatorial

647
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:17,439
or they become destroyers.

648
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:20,907
I mean, you cannot give anything to human beings

649
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,232
without realization.

650
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:24,820
Anything they get extreme, they become mad.

651
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:26,954
That's one word you can explain.

652
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,344
Now Krishna has said, 'yoga kshema mahatmyam'.

653
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:33,566
He has said I give you Yoga,

654
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,093
that is union with God, self-realization,

655
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,598
and then I look after your kshema,

656
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,774
and kshema means your well-being.

657
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:44,984
This well-being is brought forth with this Laxshmi,

658
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:48,032
with one hand that is giving, the another is the protection.

659
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,518
This hand which gives, should not, the other hand should not know.

660
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:55,566
It should be so done so gracefully, graciously.

661
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,261
Today only I was telling the story to some people,

662
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:00,955
about my own father,

663
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,362
who was a very generous man I've ever known.

664
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,521
And he had a habit on a Sunday afternoon he used to go,

665
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,532
he used to call all the people and say that I have to

666
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:13,903
give away lots of things, I have too many things in the house.

667
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:16,446
He'd take out all the blankets, sometimes all the

668
00:40:16,558 --> 00:40:20,736
utensils and sometimes food, anything that he felt like he used to give way.

669
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,344
So people would come and he would pass on and his head was bent like that,

670
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:27,844
and some people told him, what's the use, some people are

671
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,131
taking three blankets, some are taking two blankets,

672
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:33,291
you don't even see what's happening you are just giving away,

673
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,231
please at least raise your head.

674
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,123
So he said: 'The problem is like this,

675
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,257
because I don't give, it's God Who is giving,

676
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:40,733
I'm just standing in between.

677
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,010
And they all are saying that

678
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:44,187
you are giving you are giving, thank you, thank you.

679
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,278
So I feel very shy, first of all.

680
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,647
And secondly it is the lookout of God who is giving these things

681
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,319
to see whether one gets two or one. Why should I bother.

682
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:56,389
I'm just standing in between, I'm not supposed to see who takes two or one.'

683
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:59,730
Such generosity I've seen, in my own lifetime.

684
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:02,720
And I have seen, the more generous he was,

685
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,631
the more generosity flew into our house.

686
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:09,994
I mean, that like if you open this door from the other side it starts flowing.

687
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:13,325
But some people have sixty shirts, but still they'll go

688
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:15,070
to the market and buy shirts.

689
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:17,182
And they'll say: 'Oh I have a weakness for shirts.'

690
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:19,466
Now I don't understand this weakness

691
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:21,792
of heaping up shirts after shirts.

692
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:25,529
It is ridiculous, isn't it.

693
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:28,203
Some of these things really are ridiculous,

694
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:29,688
that I have a weakness for shoes,

695
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,299
now you go and see the shoes are from top to bottom,

696
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:35,782
you can open a shoe shop, or,

697
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:39,768
it's like that, what's the use of getting so many shoes

698
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:43,358
because your foot has got the same size for years now,

699
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,995
it's not going to change, even after realization.

700
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:50,766
So there is no need to, I mean if your shoes give way is all right

701
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:54,587
but, I too have the same problem. That

702
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:58,958
I, My disciples know that they should give me a shoe, I don't know why,

703
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,310
they give me a shoe, all the time I go there they give me

704
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:03,423
chappal or a shoe or something. I said now

705
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:04,781
I've too many now what to do?

706
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,583
They said: 'Mother return it to us we'll keep it for vibrations.'

707
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:10,152
I said: 'That's a good idea,' because I have no place

708
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,889
to keep all these shoes, I mean I am not a cobbler,

709
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,545
I cannot do anything with it.

710
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:16,183
So it is useless.

711
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:17,843
Best thing is to give flowers

712
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:22,216
so that I can again send them back to some ocean or to some river.

713
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,844
So even in there, when we go on accumulating,

714
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:28,516
and I must have this, you go to the shop the people are

715
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,976
like this like this, watching everything. What is there to watch.

716
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:36,015
You see whatever you want to buy you go in the shop see what you like, you have it.

717
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,106
But sort of I must have this, I must have that.

718
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:42,320
I have known a person who had ten ironing boards

719
00:42:42,378 --> 00:42:45,752
and twenty iron in his house. All locked up.

720
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,980
I said: 'For whom?'

721
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:50,277
So she said: 'Maybe my children.' I said: 'You have only one child,

722
00:42:50,372 --> 00:42:52,044
God has been very miserly about you,

723
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:55,657
you have only one child. And now what are you going to do with this?

724
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:58,429
You'd better throw them away.' And with the electrical

725
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:01,076
I mean appliances you know they go off and all that.

726
00:43:01,152 --> 00:43:02,017
But she would not.

727
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,672
She could not, she used show everyone: 'See now I've got it.'

728
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,539
Not antiques, all modern stuff, you see.

729
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:10,465
And this is how the things go on accumulating

730
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:13,287
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

731
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:17,188
Actually you should buy something only to give it to someone.

732
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:21,682
That's the best way of enjoying it to the maximum, you see.

733
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:23,795
And anybody likes it - have it.

734
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,835
You see, that's the best way.

735
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:29,480
It's a great thing, I mean I tell you it's rather difficult for you people

736
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,478
to understand but I am one of them Wwho does that

737
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:37,083
very often, and my children and my husband are rather worried you know,

738
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,022
God knows next time what She'll give away.

739
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:42,853
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

740
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:44,670
so many things, despite all this,

741
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,729
I mean the whole time thinking what to give to whom,

742
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:51,194
still it's so many things in the house, now that we have to take a bigger house.

743
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,508
I don't know what to do with so many things

744
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,698
and I try to thrust things on the people, Baba you take this you have liked it.

745
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:00,738
But they say: 'No no no how can you give me.'

746
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,708
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

747
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,208
and one must learn how to do.

748
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,396
But I've have seen human beings are different.

749
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:10,472
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

750
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:13,907
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

751
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:15,781
It's very common you know.

752
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,839
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

753
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:20,529
and when it is coming to giving to others they'll give artificial.

754
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,029
At least don't wear at that time the diamond,

755
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:25,234
at least that much decency should be there.

756
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:29,235
So you see when it comes to giving, give it with your full heart.

757
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,735
You just feel that love of giving

758
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:36,522
and you feel so happy, because you feel so big about yourself,

759
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:40,111
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

760
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:44,166
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, and again making it into clouds,

761
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:49,198
a sort of a circle of beautiful conversion into beauty

762
00:44:49,238 --> 00:44:51,684
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

763
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:55,120
And that's what we should try to become,

764
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:58,576
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

765
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:01,397
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

766
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:07,462
And this is what it is, and this hand is for ashraya, means for the protection.

767
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,971
You must protect the people who are your subordinates,

768
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:15,832
who are dependent on you, your children.

769
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:20,066
Like, it's a very common thing to insult your children from their childhood.

770
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:22,566
Why did you spoil that carpet?

771
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:25,866
Why did you do that? You should not have said this,

772
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:29,388
why did you? This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

773
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:33,099
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

774
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:37,485
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

775
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:41,338
is known by the way children are addressed in the family.

776
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:47,241
Like, in a good family we address the children like sa.

777
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:53,543
Little bit like that, ap, means sa. We never address the children with indignity,

778
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:56,265
and we put them on a dignified level.

779
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:02,076
And it's a very nice thing. I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

780
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:09,638
that, somebody was telling her one day that, there's a very, this boy

781
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:13,395
and why don't you marry him. She said: 'Why do you want to talk about marriage?

782
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:16,994
I'm not yet grown at all to think about marriage,

783
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:19,888
and we have to be dignified about things,

784
00:46:20,023 --> 00:46:23,069
how can we think of marriage when we are not to think,

785
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:27,858
and my grandmother will marry me and I want to live, a dignified person.'

786
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:32,060
A little girl of seven years said this to this woman who was very,

787
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:35,212
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

788
00:46:35,274 --> 00:46:39,070
to tease my granddaughter. She said: 'It's not dignified'.

789
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,689
Just think of that. At the age of seven years they have their sense of dignity.

790
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:47,633
If you tell them, you see they, you need not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

791
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,257
but give them dignity they will never spoil it. You'll be surprised.

792
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,941
Because we all the time cut them short, they become so bad.

793
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:58,023
They want to, they think we are good for nothing, we don't know

794
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,923
what to do, all the time they're telling us like this.

795
00:47:01,022 --> 00:47:03,943
Or even if you have to tell them, tell about somebody else,

796
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:06,779
like that boy, you know, he was absolutely

797
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:08,637
useless, he didn't know what to do,

798
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:11,197
he spoiled the whole carpet, I went to his house and slipped down.

799
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:13,103
The child immediately gets the thing.

800
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:15,795
But directly all the time hitting the child,

801
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:17,939
you see gives him a personality

802
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:20,144
which does not hold,

803
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:22,644
anything substantial within.

804
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:26,536
He might later on became a very arrogant person taking a cue from his parents,

805
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,446
and he may behave the same manner,

806
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,323
but he would not be that dignity

807
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:34,339
which just is silent and is expressing and manifesting.

808
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:37,421
It should be a silent dignity which just manifests,

809
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:39,505
and when people see such a person,

810
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:44,389
it happens, people see and say 'Oh what a man, what a dignity'.

811
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:48,687
You see that's what, and they become sort of ideals for society.

812
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,800
I think this, correcting the children is not the way,

813
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:56,147
it is not disciplining, but it is making them grow.

814
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:59,276
What we have to give to our children is the joy,

815
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:04,548
is happiness of the family, is the complete security,

816
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,872
a sense of complete security

817
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,440
and you will see you'll never have teenage problems,

818
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,761
never have teenage problem.

819
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,845
You'll be surprised you put them anywhere,

820
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:19,504
they'll be so dignified and so mature, that people will be amazed.

821
00:48:20,004 --> 00:48:23,002
You won't have to tell them. Even small little children I've seen,

822
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:25,415
if you keep your house very clean,

823
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:30,049
and also always look after it, children themselves will keep it clean.

824
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:32,812
They would like to do. Because children are

825
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:37,215
really the budding beauties.

826
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,799
When we cut them we cut them at the root.

827
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
They expect so much from us you see,

828
00:48:43,138 --> 00:48:44,728
they lose all their dignity

829
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,912
and I'll tell you try this with your children,

830
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,449
give them dignity, you will be amazed how they behave.

831
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:52,488
We say they are spoilt, I've never see

832
00:48:52,614 --> 00:48:54,879
children being spoilt when they are dignified.

833
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:58,857
Like my own grandson is a realized soul who's a very great person and

834
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,642
all his friends are above twenty-five years,

835
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,801
you see he's just a five six year old boy and

836
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:07,799
he doesn't like to wear any dress which has got

837
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:10,703
funny faces and all that He says:

838
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:12,858
'This is like a clown, I'm not a clown,

839
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:16,481
I don't want to wear'. I found it very difficult in Singapore to buy

840
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,798
a pant for him

841
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:19,499
which didn't have any funny faces,

842
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,299
because all of them had Mickey Mouse this that.

843
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:24,939
And I've seen my grandchildren also,

844
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:29,104
daughters, there these dolls with, you see this ducky

845
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:32,247
what you call the duck sort of a face you see.

846
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,812
They said: 'What's wrong with these dolls,

847
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,986
they should know how to put their lips. This is not good.'

848
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:41,310
I mean you see, they themselves know, that this is wrong.

849
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:45,053
'She's going to go into tantrums.' That's what they say.

850
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:48,171
This duck is going to go into tantrums

851
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,125
that's why she is behaving like this,

852
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:54,408
oh like that, you see they are great-grandmothers sometimes the way they

853
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:57,237
do some things and the way they behave.

854
00:49:57,392 --> 00:49:59,392
But we must give them

855
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:02,207
real love and joy and happiness,

856
00:50:02,535 --> 00:50:04,535
that's the thing we can give to our children

857
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:08,925
and you'll be amazed that this Australia is going to be blessed with children

858
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,256
who are very great saints,

859
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:14,528
very very great saints. I know that,

860
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:18,890
and you have to look after them with dignity.

861
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:22,857
Very great saints are going to be born in this country,

862
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:26,574
so I have to request to you, that forget your problems,

863
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:30,939
husband wife problem, is nothing. Look after your children,

864
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:34,543
give them dignity, give them a nest where they could live,

865
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,312
forget because I've seen in England I've seen

866
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,190
even an eighty-year old woman behaves like a bride

867
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:43,572
I mean she doesn't get over her feeling that she was a bride.

868
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,786
Like one of the 'Great Expectations'

869
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,743
you must have read of Charles Dickens where there was a bride

870
00:50:48,897 --> 00:50:51,044
who was sitting all the time thinking she was a bride.

871
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,820
I see that picture even today,

872
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,916
all the time they are in bridal mood.

873
00:50:55,128 --> 00:50:59,359
You see you are a mother and you have to treat your children with that dignity

874
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:02,159
and with that love that a mother should give.

875
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:05,053
It is very difficult for some people

876
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:06,974
to accept the position of a mother,

877
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:09,099
they think why women should be the mothers.

878
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:14,630
I said this is the greatest things look at me. Look at me.

879
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,915
This is the greatest thing to be the mother,

880
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,007
to love everyone, that they depend on you for

881
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,262
love and guidance, just for love.

882
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:27,197
Such a great thing to feel: 'Oh God

883
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:31,550
see how much I can give, how many cups I can fill,'

884
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:33,848
it's such a great feeling,

885
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:37,807
I wish you would know what a mother is and the,

886
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:42,112
motherhood you have to learn from your children and grandchildren and expand it

887
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,958
to the whole universe. It's such a great thing a woman has in the same way

888
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:49,872
the father has to do a lot of things about which I will tell you

889
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:51,613
when we go to the other center.

890
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:54,677
I think I've talked at length on this center because

891
00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:57,999
all the time what I find these two centers are catching

892
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:00,124
very much in Australia.

893
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:04,621
So we have to talk about the things that are catching on this and this.

894
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:08,453
And today I saw there five six children with their both the fingers in,

895
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:11,358
all realized children with those fingers they were sucking,

896
00:52:11,454 --> 00:52:13,454
and they were showing me again sucking like that.

897
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:15,637
So you can imagine how much it is,

898
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:19,140
and otherwise this one and this means that

899
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,345
you have been going to some unauthorized personality.

900
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:26,636
If you are going to some unauthorized personality this thumb will be caught up,

901
00:52:26,732 --> 00:52:30,660
that's why children put their things in their mouths and

902
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Freud has his own nonsensical theory,

903
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:37,130
but actually it is the center that is catching

904
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:39,895
with these born-realized children are showing you.

905
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,426
Now for today, I may not be able to cover other

906
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,572
centers so much, but later on,

907
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:50,580
what is the date we are having the program now?

908
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,033
Next Monday Wednesday Friday,

909
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,897
three days are there out of which I will cover all these centers

910
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,608
and specially that of Christ I would like to speak,

911
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:05,331
because I met some people, when I went to America

912
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:07,216
I was telling the people there

913
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,943
that you are to be born again,

914
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:12,129
you are to be born again and you must have your realization,

915
00:53:12,216 --> 00:53:15,307
so what I found whatever lecture I gave there were big big,

916
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:19,444
much bigger than these you see, they had brought to tape

917
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:23,533
all my speeches, and the people who organized my program told me that:

918
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:27,760
'Mother you'd better get it patented or don't allow them to tape it.'

919
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:30,955
I said: 'Why?' They said: 'They will be publishing these are all writers

920
00:53:30,993 --> 00:53:32,823
and this I said: 'Very good let them write.'

921
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:37,642
But some of them started an organization called 'born again', imagine.

922
00:53:37,704 --> 00:53:40,666
Now if I said you have to be,

923
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:44,105
then you start an organization that we are already self-certificated.

924
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:48,229
You see it's a thing one should understand you are to be born again.

925
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:53,024
Now Christ has said that you will be born through Me. Is a fact.

926
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:57,780
Where is Christ, is here. This is the gate, see the narrow gate

927
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:01,011
and your kundalini has to pass through that.

928
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:05,133
Now in case it does not pass you have to say Lord's Prayer.

929
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:07,365
You have to take the name of Christ

930
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:09,380
and you have to adore Him,

931
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:13,802
then only it passes through, shows that you have passed through Christ.

932
00:54:14,302 --> 00:54:17,464
You enter into the kingdom of God which is the,

933
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:20,620
limbic area. So, it's a fact

934
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:23,120
when He said you have to pass through Me

935
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,296
He didn't mean that people who are self-certificated

936
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:28,383
can say that: 'All right this is Christ,

937
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:31,949
this is Bible this is Christ,' as if Christ is somewhere lying there,

938
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:34,084
you just have to turn a stone and you get Him there.

939
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:38,567
Christ is here. How do you approach Him is only

940
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:42,094
through the kundalini awakening and it passes through Christ.

941
00:54:42,351 --> 00:54:43,391
This is the door.

942
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:47,490
Now say, you are all Christians or maybe you are Jews or whatever it is,

943
00:54:47,722 --> 00:54:50,196
but, in India for example

944
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:53,426
they have a very antagonistic feelings towards Christianity.

945
00:54:53,804 --> 00:54:55,926
Now even a Hindu, or a Muslim,

946
00:54:56,864 --> 00:55:01,360
if he denies he says all right I don't believe in Christ. He has to.

947
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:03,568
I have to tell him that: 'See,

948
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:06,808
if you don't believe in Christ I cannot give you realization.

949
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
You have to ask for forgiveness,

950
00:55:09,078 --> 00:55:12,277
and you have to request Christ, then only this will pass through.

951
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:15,214
Now there may be Jews or Christians,

952
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,317
any type, they have to know that all of them are here.

953
00:55:18,817 --> 00:55:21,940
For example there was a doctor who came from,

954
00:55:22,075 --> 00:55:25,360
Tehran to see me, he had cancer,

955
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,930
and he came to see me, he had this cancer of the stomach,

956
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:33,573
so I told him that: 'Do you believe that Mohammed Sahib was the same

957
00:55:33,635 --> 00:55:37,571
as Dattatreya or Nanaka?' He said: 'No I don't even believe,

958
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:39,682
when you say that He was Moses or Abraham.

959
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:42,182
I said: 'He was Moses Abraham

960
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:44,512
and they are very powerful personality.

961
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:46,647
Unless and until you accept,

962
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:49,147
that He was Moses and Abraham,

963
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,647
you are not going to get it.

964
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:55,520
He said: 'Ah, I cannot say that,' because Jews and Muslims are like this.

965
00:55:56,093 --> 00:55:59,363
I said they both are the same they are very great personalities,

966
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,450
you are just fighting for nothing at all.

967
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:06,569
I know Who is Moses and I know Who is, Abraham.

968
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:10,770
But he would not accept, for eight days, then his wife, you know

969
00:56:10,832 --> 00:56:13,845
she was wiser, she said you'd better get it, you are not well,

970
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,403
you'll die, better get it, then they came.

971
00:56:16,465 --> 00:56:19,152
You see this is what happens, they are just compelled.

972
00:56:19,214 --> 00:56:22,319
He came: 'All right Mother what ever you say I will accept.' I said: 'Not that,

973
00:56:22,357 --> 00:56:25,532
from your heart you have to say,' and he was cured,

974
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:27,594
for your information he was cured.

975
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:29,705
So do not have any extreme ideas,

976
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:32,603
They are all in there, and They are all One.

977
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:36,868
Only we are fighting saying this is mine, that is mine,

978
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,174
so this is I have just hinted that this center because I think

979
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:42,113
that's a very important center

980
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:45,655
as I have discussed with the void, about all these Abraham,

981
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,989
Moses and all the Old Testament, which is so important.

982
00:56:49,027 --> 00:56:52,711
How, and how Christ is the One, Who,

983
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,591
stays there, Who crucified Himself, to make a path

984
00:56:56,653 --> 00:57:00,145
for us to pass through, why His crucifixion was necessary.

985
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:04,245
So I'll spend more time on that later on. I hope

986
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:08,757
you'll make it convenient to come again, and I hope you'll get a better hall,

987
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:12,488
they are feeling very warm here. Thank you very much.
