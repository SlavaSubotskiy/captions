Shri Krishna Puja. New York (USA), 8 June 1997

4
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:15,800
Today we have decided to have Shri Krishna Puja

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,351
in the land of Shri Krishna.

6
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,783
Though this is the land of Shri Krishna,

7
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:38,991
people ask Me why the people are not spiritual.

8
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:46,856
How is it they get entangled into different types

9
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:51,936
of seekings which are not leading to truth?

10
00:00:52,136 --> 00:01:00,843
Why is it the people in America are not so alert as to recognize

11
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:05,986
what is the truth and what they have to find?

12
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:14,709
Shri Krishna’s time was, as you know,

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,867
at least two thousand after Shri Rama.

14
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:28,347
And Shri Rama created lots of disciplines

15
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:38,298
for human beings to follow in the path of their ascent.

16
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,912
According to the time everything works out.

17
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:51,810
So people were extremely rigid, disciplined,

18
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:05,158
and it so happened that people lost the touch with the truth.

19
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:16,016
They would leave their wives, ill-treat their wives,

20
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:22,977
do all kinds of things in the name of Shri Rama;

21
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:30,367
because always human beings take to something which is not right.

22
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,149
The another side they never saw,

23
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:39,965
how Rama went after Sitaji to find Her, and He fought

24
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:48,847
the horrible rakshasa Ravana to get back His wife.

25
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:53,152
So the other side people never see.

26
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:57,561
Only this side they saw that He was very strict with His wife,

27
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:02,351
and if the wife stayed over in some function

28
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:06,609
He got so angry, and He shouted at Her and He threw Her out,

29
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,611
and all those things.

30
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:19,074
That is how Shri Krishna came in.

31
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,439
Always incarnations come one after another

32
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,401
to correct themselves only.

33
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:34,503
When Shri Krishna found that it is on the other side, of ego

34
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:37,439
– that men thought they were very powerful people

35
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,761
and they could do whatever they liked,

36
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:43,783
and they had all the power to judge their wives –

37
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:50,662
so Shri Krishna came with a new diversion,

38
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:56,535
or I should say, from a new idea about life.

39
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:09,859
He talked of freedom, He talked of abandonment,

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,634
and He talked that life is for enjoyment.

41
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,751
Radha was the source of joy.

42
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:27,609
“Ra” is energy, “dha” means the one who sustains energy.

43
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,845
She was the source of joy,

44
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:39,658
and His idea was, to enjoy life is the best way to live.

45
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:46,889
And that’s why He said that you should play Holi,

46
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,245
you should enjoy yourselves, you must have Raas,

47
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:58,195
by which you enjoy group dancing and freedom.

48
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:05,204
So people thought that’s the way one has to live

49
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:13,450
– is to be absolutely free, live as you like, specially in America.

50
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:20,196
They thought that to enjoy life is complete abandonment:

51
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:24,916
no discipline, no bindings,

52
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,325
you can divorce your wife eight times and husbands ten times.

53
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:34,094
That sort of a life started long time back,

54
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:38,645
but it really prospered in America.

55
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:44,094
The prosperity of this kind of a culture came to such a level

56
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:49,758
that now we don’t know what’s going to happen to the family system,

57
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,229
to the joy part of it.

58
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:01,693
Again here people forgot the other side of it.

59
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:08,434
Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesh.

60
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,153
Shri Ganesh is the source of wisdom,

61
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:19,840
He’s the source of auspiciousness.

62
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,460
Through Him we understand auspiciousness.

63
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,069
And He is a child, He is an eternal child.

64
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:44,430
And this behavior of abandonment

65
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:52,770
is very destructive, if there is no wisdom.

66
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,867
First thing was to establish wisdom within ourselves.

67
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:10,516
But we start a theory or a kind of a pattern of life

68
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:15,914
without thinking have we got the wisdom or not?

69
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:23,704
Are we capable of following that pattern of life

70
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:30,474
without any development of our wisdom?

71
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:38,959
But the worst was when the freedom became the criteria of life,

72
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:46,281
people became extremely dominating and egoistical.

73
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,788
The first answer always you will get it, “What’s wrong?”

74
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,030
You ask them, “Why are you doing this?”

75
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,841
“What’s wrong?”

76
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,083
“I mean, it’s wrong because it is not auspicious.”

77
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,747
“What’s auspiciousness?” is there

78
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:12,647
– absolutely like you can call them,

79
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:20,315
people without any brains, brainless people.

80
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:25,209
“Brainless” means there is no wisdom.

81
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,563
What is the power of brain is wisdom.

82
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:41,925
So life started drifting into a destructive

83
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:50,923
bourn, we should say, of no return.

84
00:08:52,694 --> 00:09:01,002
And every kind of filth was accepted as a blessing,

85
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,283
and nobody would think that this is wrong,

86
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:13,508
this is not for human life.

87
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:17,335
Even the animals are all not like that.

88
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:29,526
Added to that came the stupidity of drinking alcohol.

89
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,284
I don’t know how they discovered alcohol

90
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,644
long time back, long, long time back, but they say

91
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:49,714
it came out of the manthana and out of the churning of the ocean

92
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:57,436
by the suras and asuras, by the rakshasas and by the devas.

93
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:03,602
Must be some trick to get these rakshasas drunk,

94
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:11,989
and to somehow or other manage to get the kumbha

95
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:20,285
of, the pitcher of amruta, ambrosia;

96
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,864
so that these rakshasas will be lost drinking

97
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:33,450
and then the devas will get their due,

98
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,336
which was amruta, which was ambrosia.

99
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,821
That might be one of the reasons

100
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,650
that it was created out of the ocean,

101
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:53,306
or among all the fourteen things that came out of the ocean.

102
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:02,746
So kind of a oppositions,

103
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:08,036
opposite quality of things were created.

104
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:13,783
Another thing they created were prostitutes.

105
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:21,195
One may ask why prostitutes came out of that manthana

106
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:26,158
– because now you have freedom.

107
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:34,532
You are given freedom to choose, and so you must have

108
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:47,368
full vision whether to choose an auspicious life, a holy life,

109
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:53,519
a divine life, or to choose destructive life.

110
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:57,320
This opposition came forward

111
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,309
because your freedom had to be respected,

112
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,248
that was very important.

113
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:10,047
In the growth of human awareness it was very important

114
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:14,402
to respect the freedom of human beings.

115
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:20,531
Because animals, if you see, they have no freedom:

116
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:26,984
a snake will be a snake, scorpion will be a scorpion,

117
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,915
lion will be a lion.

118
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:36,614
They live with their own qualities, gunas;

119
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:44,107
you cannot make them do something that other animals are doing.

120
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:50,336
We have passed through all these different animal yonis

121
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:55,847
and now we are human beings, and now we have freedom.

122
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,684
Now why freedom, one may ask –

123
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,284
because these days they ask such questions for everything you say

124
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:05,586
– why freedom needed?

125
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:10,626
Like I always told you before that in the school

126
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:13,804
they teach you two plus two is four,

127
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,650
and you have to remember it.

128
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:22,814
But when you grow and when you go to college,

129
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:29,129
you are supposed to have freedom to understand everything yourself.

130
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:40,220
In the same manner, your awareness was to be brought to that level

131
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,282
that you could use your freedom wisely.

132
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:53,147
Now, you have to have temptations.

133
00:13:53,347 --> 00:14:00,240
How can you judge a person whether he is blind or not blind?

134
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,817
Supposing you ask a blind person, “Is this a flower?”

135
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:12,190
He might feel it, say, “No, no, it’s a bee.”

136
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:17,872
So he has to have his eyes to see,

137
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:23,324
and once you give him the eyes he goes amok.

138
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,384
He doesn’t know what to do, what is good for him.

139
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:38,494
So he chose all that was not at all good for him,

140
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:44,489
auspicious for him, and detrimental for his growth.

141
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,787
So the drinking started,

142
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:55,744
and with drinking you don’t know how we get abandoned.

143
00:14:56,412 --> 00:15:02,887
I have heard people, that they lose their sense of relationship

144
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:09,261
with brothers, sisters, mothers, everything, if you get drunk.

145
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:12,740
So many drunkards have told Me this.

146
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,037
That is why in this country we have funny type of relationships

147
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:22,367
– one can’t understand, how can it be? But it is so.

148
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:25,788
By drinking, all these things have happened

149
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:29,314
that they don’t know who is your sister, who is your wife,

150
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:31,808
who is your mother.

151
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,125
In India also we have but different type of thing,

152
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,098
that they will ill-treat their mother,

153
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:45,330
they’ll ill-treat their sister, ill-treat their wives;

154
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,879
the other way round also.

155
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:53,124
But here they do not ill-treat,

156
00:15:55,203 --> 00:16:00,099
they love, but in a very perverted manner.

157
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:04,921
You see the reaction in two countries.

158
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:12,354
So this grew up very much, and today we see a country

159
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,992
that is America in a complete chaos.

160
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:35,040
So this freedom without any wisdom at all growing,

161
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:42,833
starts creating a terrible ego.

162
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:53,187
When auspiciousness is given up then Shri Ganesha sleeps

163
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:59,604
and as Christ, who is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha,

164
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:02,268
also doesn’t bother.

165
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:08,267
So the rule of Christ is finished.

166
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:16,922
So what rules is the ego, this ego which thinks it is free.

167
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:23,378
It doesn’t know it is bound by all kinds of enemies

168
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:26,697
of very horrible types.

169
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,887
At the time of Shri Krishna He said

170
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:35,587
that the worst enemy human beings have is anger,

171
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:42,254
but I think in modern times the worst enemy human beings have

172
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:45,740
is greed and jealousy.

173
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:50,398
Greed has no meaning these days. I mean,

174
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:56,579
what do you say to a person who has three thousand shoes

175
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,615
– I mean, pairs of shoes? Must be mad!

176
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,431
There are all sorts of things, you know,

177
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,598
in greed you see these days.

178
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:15,811
You don’t know how people are really behaving. No one can explain.

179
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:23,074
I know of someone who has five thousand dogs.

180
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:29,915
What is she doing with those dogs I don’t know, but she has.

181
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:39,741
Like all countries, even in America I think it’s much worse,

182
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,054
much worse.

183
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,183
Now you may call it anything, consumerism or anything like that,

184
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:51,893
or your economics which is, I think, very faulty,

185
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,340
it doesn’t understand human beings

186
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,533
– whatever it may be, it can never bring benevolence,

187
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:06,185
neither to the person who thinks he is rich,

188
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:12,851
or to the people whom he is exploiting.

189
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,494
As far as spirituality is concerned,

190
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:25,507
they are all away from the realm of divinity.

191
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,750
Now the mind starts working with ego.

192
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,689
Ego takes over like a computer,

193
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,819
and it starts suggesting ways and methods

194
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,927
by which how much money you can earn.

195
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:45,913
So when you start earning money,

196
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:51,017
then again the same Ego Mister tells you

197
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:54,799
how to destroy yourself with this money.

198
00:19:56,815 --> 00:20:00,307
They do all kinds of things when they have money.

199
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:04,794
I mean, that money is not a lakshmi prasad;

200
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,932
it is some sort of a money

201
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:12,801
that becomes like a rakshasa or a devil and which devours you.

202
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:17,729
It takes you to all kinds of wrong places.

203
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,455
It takes you to such horrible theories

204
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:28,836
that nobody would accept such theories.

205
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:35,806
This ego makes you feel that – ah, yes, you are perfect,

206
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:41,160
you know everything, whatever you are doing is the best.

207
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:45,670
But with all that doing, what happens?

208
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,879
You become restless, you cannot sleep.

209
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,537
Now with the problem here is that

210
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:58,801
people have this so-called tension, stress.

211
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:01,680
In our young age we never heard of this word,

212
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,521
what is tension, stress is.

213
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,558
Even now in India very few people know about it.

214
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:12,567
Because you yourself, you are destroying yourself.

215
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:17,696
So with this money, say, you want to entice some woman

216
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:20,311
– take a very low-level thing.

217
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:24,720
Then you’ll run after her, give her this, give her that,

218
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,867
and spend all your money till you become bankrupt.

219
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:33,817
And then you’ll start sitting and crying.

220
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,193
And this is a common story.

221
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:40,545
I don’t know why don’t they make films like this,

222
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:45,534
to show actually what happens to a person who runs after money,

223
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,072
and he goes on then spending that money.

224
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:53,423
He doesn’t know what to do, you see; money also eats him, I think.

225
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,598
On the other side we have people who are extremely miserly.

226
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:09,618
So all their – with the money only, they become so much greedy

227
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:14,302
that they keep their money in seven locks and keys.

228
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:18,876
Now, they see in the world there are people

229
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:23,731
who are suffering so much, who have so much problem.

230
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:28,450
Why not spend some money on them?

231
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:36,480
So then there are agents come up, like our Swiss bank.

232
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,781
Swiss bank is the outcome of our greed, completely our greed;

233
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:49,530
because we have so much money we don’t know what to do,

234
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,315
so we put it in the Swiss bank.

235
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:56,376
Swiss bank says, “All right, we’ll look after it.”

236
00:22:56,576 --> 00:23:01,127
Because we are greedy as well as we are miserly.

237
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:05,005
I mean, miserly people are another crackpots, I should say,

238
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:09,065
the way they live. But also the people who have money

239
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,425
are really crackpots.

240
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:19,123
They have no sense of self-respect, neither self-esteem.

241
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,723
Now imagine eighty, ninety-year-old women

242
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:27,361
going for a shake dance, as I told you.

243
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:31,200
Because they have money they think they should do this,

244
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,274
competing with the young people, because they have money.

245
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:41,827
If they have money, if they get it without any, I should say,

246
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,891
cheating or without deceiving someone,

247
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:50,512
if it’s a real good money they should give it to some good cause

248
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:55,630
and try to propagate goodness.

249
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:59,189
But money itself seems to be something very bad,

250
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,024
like poison,

251
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:07,846
because either this money makes you mad

252
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:13,567
how to spend it, or mad how to save it.

253
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:19,067
As if you become a slave of this money business,

254
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:24,835
and in that slavishness you go on drifting, drifting, drifting.

255
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:33,249
I’ve seen people when they talk,

256
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:37,063
you don’t know why they talk like that, you know.

257
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,840
Then you discover that they have a bank account,

258
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,926
that’s why they are talking like that.

259
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:49,091
If you don’t have bank account then you won’t talk like that.

260
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,373
I mean, more than that also.

261
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:57,124
This country is overflowing with money,

262
00:24:57,324 --> 00:25:01,259
with all kinds of money transactions,

263
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,236
permutations and combinations and this and that,

264
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,482
and what you can do with money

265
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:11,243
– because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

266
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:17,905
He is the Deity, or we can say He is the God of wealth.

267
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:25,055
But at the same time, He is a very mischievous God.

268
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,926
You can see clearly:

269
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,064
this is supposed to be Shri Krishna’s country

270
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:34,726
which is overflowing with money.

271
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:39,446
At the same time you find horrible things happening,

272
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:41,369
worst in the whole world.

273
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:44,594
I mean, no one can beat Americans, they say,

274
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:58,702
in stupidity, in vulgarity, indecency, exploitation.

275
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:06,454
So this is the curse of money on human beings,

276
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:12,088
which is to be understood, that freedom without wisdom

277
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:17,196
is the most dangerous thing to use.

278
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:23,621
It is better not to be free if you have no wisdom,

279
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:27,128
because God knows what you will do

280
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:30,790
if you have freedom and no wisdom.

281
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:37,639
I’ve seen here, heard about women who are killing their children.

282
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:41,961
I mean, nowhere you will find such a thing like that,

283
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:44,647
killing small children.

284
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:53,226
Now how this money makes you so dry that you have no,

285
00:26:53,901 --> 00:27:02,290
I would say, no love, no feeling.

286
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:08,286
Just for killing’s sake also, people kill here.

287
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:20,084
Now there are – there’s another thing that this money does:

288
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,170
it creates a disparity.

289
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:27,912
There are some who are very rich,

290
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:31,369
there are some who are very poor.

291
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:40,065
So those who are very poor are against those who are very rich.

292
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:43,198
They can’t understand why should these people

293
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,752
have so much money, so they think it’s a matter of right

294
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:54,155
to snatch all that money from them and use it for themselves.

295
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:58,437
But the same money can destroy them also,

296
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:05,834
so snatching that money with violence or grabbing it

297
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:10,189
is not going to give you any blessings.

298
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:18,619
So what is the purpose of wealth?

299
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:26,467
That is very important for people who worship Shri Krishna to know.

300
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:31,459
In Shri Krishna’s life, He saw

301
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:39,723
that the women who were creating buttermilk and butter

302
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:45,578
were carrying all that all the way to Mathura,

303
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,727
where in Mathura this horrible King Kamsa was reigning.

304
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:55,470
And they used to give to all the soldiers there.

305
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,737
He didn’t want them to do that.

306
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:02,272
Because they would fetch much more money,

307
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:09,928
they would be paid much more, so these women were greedy about it.

308
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,640
Instead of giving them to their own children,

309
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,270
to their own families, they used to collect all that

310
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,195
and take to Mathura.

311
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:26,972
From very childhood Shri Krishna used to throw stones

312
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:32,635
at those pitchers and break their pitchers,

313
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:39,817
because he didn’t want that to go all the way to Mathura

314
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:44,285
to feed those horrible soldiers.

315
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:50,369
This is what it is we have to learn,

316
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:57,232
that if we have, say, surplus money or something,

317
00:29:57,432 --> 00:30:00,396
you have to think what you can do with it

318
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:12,970
and what joy it can bring, by sharing with right type of people.

319
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:17,624
Not in the pubs, no, no, I don’t mean that,

320
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:24,817
but sharing it for their needs and what they want.

321
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,783
Actually a disciple of Shri Krishna

322
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:32,788
should be a self-satisfied person.

323
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:39,625
Look at His life, how self-satisfied He was.

324
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:51,685
Every episode about Him talks of His complete oneness with Himself.

325
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,670
For example, when Arjuna asked Him that

326
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,435
“Why don’t You join us Pandavas to fight with us?”

327
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:08,189
In modern times in the competitive life,

328
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:12,813
you see, if you see those races, they’re so anxious to win,

329
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,188
to have the higher position.

330
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:22,275
Then all the big, big politicians

331
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:26,416
are trying to bring down other politicians,

332
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:29,902
to have their own power.

333
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:36,958
But what did Shri Krishna say, that “I will be your charioteer.

334
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:41,541
I’ll drive your chariot, but I will not lift

335
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:46,039
My weapon against anyone.”

336
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:50,466
We can’t think of anyone like that today.

337
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:54,969
See, people will never say that, “All right,

338
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,976
I will stay down and you’ll be on the throne.”

339
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:04,742
Very difficult even to see one person

340
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:08,165
who could behave like Shri Krishna.

341
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:12,505
Because whether He is a charioteer

342
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:17,738
or He is the one who was Arjuna,

343
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:23,587
or He was the captain of the whole thing,

344
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:28,479
He knew what He was. What was the need for Him

345
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,626
to become this or that, and that?

346
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,108
But these days, you see,

347
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:38,052
to become something is such a struggle going on.

348
00:32:38,252 --> 00:32:42,426
Someone wants to be, say, the prime minister

349
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:45,270
– that’s the highest, I think, I don’t know.

350
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,727
But then some want to dislodge the prime minister.

351
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,024
Then you start from the peon upward, everybody wants

352
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:57,892
something higher, higher, higher, higher.

353
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:02,223
This is another very subtle type of greed

354
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:08,061
which is working out in our minds.

355
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:15,023
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen that the leaders

356
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,874
– now are settled down of course, much better –

357
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:22,862
but used to be such a terrible fight for leadership.

358
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:27,743
It’s all a myth, actual myth, but they used to fight.

359
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:32,095
And they would write letters after letters. There were groups:

360
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:35,657
one group would write against another group,

361
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:38,188
another group would write against this group,

362
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:46,451
and I used to just laugh, because there’s no truth in it.

363
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:50,750
Leadership is no truth, it’s just a joke.

364
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,530
But even if I told them it’s a joke,

365
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,327
they would not understand it’s a joke and not to be that serious,

366
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:59,976
and to fight about it.

367
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,314
Gradually it settled down normally

368
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:07,346
– better, much better, it’s not so much bad.

369
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,627
But that is what is there, this greed.

370
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,745
That was the mistake, I think, of Shri Krishna,

371
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:20,312
that instead of anger He should have put greed as the worst thing.

372
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:26,938
Actually, you see, these incarnations don’t know much about human beings,

373
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,512
and they would not know how far they will be going

374
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:35,456
– same happens to Me. But they are absolutely unaware

375
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:40,095
that what these human beings are, what you tell them,

376
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:44,167
what they will make out of it.

377
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:49,378
Their brains are so sharp

378
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:53,039
that they’ll pick up whatever is wrong for them,

379
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,505
and never see whatever is right for them.

380
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,265
Shri Rama tried something – it was of no use.

381
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:07,390
Shri Krishna tried something – it was of no use.

382
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,085
So we come to Shri Jesus Christ.

383
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:15,462
Nowadays the people who are something else are

384
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:19,903
ardent disciples of Christ.

385
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,637
They have no wisdom of any kind.

386
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:37,864
Like mad they are going about.

387
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:40,392
You read there about their organizations,

388
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:43,021
you read about things that they do,

389
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:48,314
you are amazed at it; you see, how can they be disciples of Christ?

390
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:56,328
In no way they have any right on Christ to begin with,

391
00:35:56,528 --> 00:36:01,629
because they don’t know anything about Christ.

392
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:06,489
First to know and then to imbibe His qualities

393
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:15,205
are something very, very, I should say, impossible thing these days.

394
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:20,735
Some would say, “Why was He born in a poor family?

395
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:26,551
He was born in a poor family – He should have been born to Mr. Ford.”

396
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:31,682
Some say – I mean, you see, finding faults and criticizing

397
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:35,380
is the only thing left to us now

398
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:40,169
because you can’t do anything else, that’s why.

399
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,974
Then they would say, “Why did He get himself crucified?”

400
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:48,110
He didn’t crucify you. He should have crucified you,

401
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,951
but actually He crucified himself, that was His mistake.

402
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,462
It is also very difficult for human beings

403
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:05,622
to understand incarnations, because they are in juxtaposition.

404
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:10,688
They are very different things, so human beings can’t understand.

405
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:16,354
Now they are there to lead them,

406
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:20,265
they are there to tell them what is to be done;

407
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:27,066
but the way they understand, you see, it’s just absurd.

408
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:35,631
For example, you know in Chicago I met the head of the Hare Rama.

409
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:41,038
Another puzzle he was to Me, really,

410
00:37:41,238 --> 00:37:44,175
because he came in a very thin dhoti

411
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:48,462
and it was so very cold, and he was shivering before Me.

412
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:53,315
So I said, “Sir, why are you wearing such a thin dhoti?

413
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:56,440
You are shivering, I am very sorry.”

414
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,324
He said, “Why? My guru has told me

415
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:02,294
that I should have a thin dhoti.”

416
00:38:02,494 --> 00:38:06,824
“Why?” “To go to heaven, to achieve my ascent.”

417
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:09,095
I said, “Really? He told you like that?

418
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:12,931
But Shri Krishna never wore a thin dhoti.”

419
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:15,418
“But I am not Shri Krishna,” he said

420
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:20,925
– see how the human mind tries to avoid.

421
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:31,824
So now, then he had shaved his head and had a big pony-tail behind.

422
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,875
I asked him, “Why have you shaved your head?”

423
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:38,726
So he said, “Because my guru told me that you have to shave your head

424
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,761
if you have to go to heaven.”

425
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:45,880
So I said, “But Shri Krishna did not shave His head.”

426
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,025
“No, no, but He was incarnation.

427
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:53,280
I have to shave my head so I have to go to heaven.”

428
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,416
So I told him, “See, Kabira has said,

429
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:10,133
‘These sheep are shaven and shorn every year twice.

430
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,794
And if they all go to heaven where will be a place left for you?’ ”

431
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,046
So he never understood Me. He got very angry with Me,

432
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:25,531
and he said to Me, “Mother, You are talking ill about my guru.”

433
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,296
I said, “I am not talking ill. I am your Mother,

434
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,915
I am just asking Me

435
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:33,850
that what’s the use of wearing this thin dhoti, that’s all.

436
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,940
A Mother has a right to ask.” He got very angry, he went away.

437
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,351
And he’s the head of these Hare Ramas!

438
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,489
So to understand the incarnation also

439
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:58,655
you have to be a realized soul, otherwise you cannot,

440
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,604
because they look very absurd.

441
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,952
Without asking any questions if you can become a realized soul

442
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:15,720
– if you ask questions it’s one degree less –

443
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,376
without questioning if you get your realization,

444
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:26,756
without any questions, then you have the highest marks.

445
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:31,521
But if you, after questioning and this thing and that thing,

446
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:37,497
then you have less marks, because your mind is very active,

447
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:41,804
and the person whose mind is active

448
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:47,316
cannot achieve something beyond the mind.

449
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:50,606
You have to achieve it beyond the mind.

450
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:55,628
This is one thing at least if you all understand,

451
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,759
I think My work is done.

452
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:03,980
All tricks tried by Shri Krishna,

453
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,355
all disciplines put by Shri Rama,

454
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:11,255
all the gurus who tried their level best to tell you

455
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:18,823
what to do, is only to make you a yogi

456
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:23,005
by taking you beyond the mind.

457
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:29,911
And then what happens?

458
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:34,845
Then you are in connection with this all-pervading Power

459
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:39,207
which is looking after you, which protects you, which helps you;

460
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:49,954
in every way you are absolutely in charge of this Paramachaitanya.

461
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,352
Now supposing I do not take the citizenship of America

462
00:41:55,552 --> 00:41:59,503
– of course I may never take, but supposing.

463
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:04,366
Then this government is not in charge of Me.

464
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:11,367
But if I take, of course they’ll tax Me, do all kinds of things,

465
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:16,355
doesn’t matter, but at least they’ll be in charge.

466
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:22,856
But this Paramchaitanya when it takes over, it is love,

467
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:26,510
is absolute love:

468
00:42:27,732 --> 00:42:35,710
love which thinks, understands, coordinates, cooperates, works,

469
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:40,557
and extremely sensitive.

470
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:49,501
It works – I’m sometimes so surprised the way it works,

471
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:57,432
without fail, without making any mistakes.

472
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:03,858
You don’t have to even tell, because you are there.

473
00:43:05,245 --> 00:43:10,666
But to believe that we are there also is a difficult task.

474
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:20,298
With all the experiences you should believe that you are there,

475
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:24,150
but that is also quite a difficult task.

476
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,324
So when we say they’re established Sahaja yogis

477
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:35,059
then what we mean is this, that they are completely one,

478
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:42,715
under complete charge of Paramachaitanya.

479
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:47,803
That’s what we have to be.

480
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:53,602
If you want to save this country, you have to be that.

481
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:56,994
No argument, no explanation, nothing;

482
00:43:57,194 --> 00:44:01,380
no fighting, no strikes, nothing.

483
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:05,764
No placards is needed.

484
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:11,876
You are the ones who will advertise Sahaja Yoga.

485
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:18,667
Every one of you should understand that your life

486
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:22,910
is very important at this juncture.

487
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:30,646
And you have to become that special person

488
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:37,640
who reflects reality through the divine love.

489
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:40,347
May God bless you.
