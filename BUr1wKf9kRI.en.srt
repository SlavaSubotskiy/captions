1982-0712 Bhoomi Devi Puja Talk, Birmingham, UK

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:07,904
Today I was telling Rustom

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,696
that we should do of course the Puja of the Bhumi,

4
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,472
because She’s angry actually,

5
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,283
because She has produced such beautiful scenic beauty

6
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:27,315
in this part of the country, and while the people who lived here

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,008
have not understood the beauty that She has given them,

8
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,679
 and have tried to take to ugly

9
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:38,735
 and very sinful methods  of invoking

10
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:41,810
the satanic and negative forces.

11
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,618
And this has made Her very angry,

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,871
 I felt it the other day when we went out.

13
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:56,371
And it is done through the ignorance of the people, no doubt,

14
00:00:56,784 --> 00:01:01,181
but still, some of them, even knowingly, are

15
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,416
indulging into things like these.

16
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,180
Is a very serious thing,

17
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,969
because you are inviting,

18
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:15,807
inviting the satanic forces to work out your destruction.

19
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:20,157
These forces are never your friends, they’re destructive,

20
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:22,173
they can never be your friends,

21
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:25,293
because you came out of the construction of God,

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,637
and they are the destructions, and they can never be your friends.

23
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:34,431
So the nature has to be annoyed about it ,

24
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:40,239
and they think that this country doesn’t deserve a puja.

25
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,626
It is their own decision about it,

26
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,297
that they are suggesting that this country doesn’t deserve…

27
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:51,288
But I am thinking I don’t know what this country has done,

28
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:57,649
 this part of the country and that what I should do about them.

29
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:01,721
 To punish someone is very easy,

30
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:06,576
and to get angry is even easier.

31
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:15,165
But to have poise, and understanding, and compassion, is difficult.

32
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:24,592
The patience of a mother they cannot have,

33
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,489
it’s alright, I can understand them –

34
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,187
but they have to obey.

35
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,249
Something has to be done, has to be done.

36
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,960
We have to work out.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,321
Even if I go to hell, I’ll have to work it out.

38
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,295
That’s my job.

39
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:50,047
That’s what all of them and you, all put together, 
have to help me.

40
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:56,994
Because all this anger, everything, will pass away.

41
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:01,547
What will remain is the achievement,

42
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:05,813
 the achievement that we have

43
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:12,247
accomplished by our perseverance and our patience.

44
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:20,272
So once we realise the achievement

45
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:23,037
and the importance of the achievement,

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,339
we do not give way to these temporary moods

47
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:33,491
we have to be absolutely tranquil and understanding about it.

48
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:42,780
Also in this way we play into the hands of the negative forces,

49
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:46,064
because they want to be disturbing,

50
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:48,330
and we play into their hands in the anger.

51
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,778
So actually, when we are angry, actually

52
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,935
we are going against ourselves.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,589
You are playing into the hands of the negative.

54
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:59,843
So what’s the use of getting angry and showing temper?

55
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:06,411
It is addressed to these angry natural things that.

56
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:12,608
Alright. Now, we should start our puja

57
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:18,427
because I think we should start it 
and it will settle down then with the puja.

58
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:24,261
As it is, when I first came to England I said there is a big

59
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,196
 curse of the Goddess on this country.

60
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,952
Really. That time the climate was just like this.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,963
And you could not even step out of your door.

62
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,861
We were staying in Alwich, I remember.

63
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:44,649
And the car was hardly about, say, ten feet,

64
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:48,454
and we didn’t know how to reach the car, it was so windy.

65
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:52,878
And we were wearing coats and everything, but everything was

66
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:57,233
 absolutely in a windy state.

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:03,301
And then I said that this country is really 
under the curse of the Goddess.

68
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:13,406
But the one who curses also can take back the curse, isn’t it?

69
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:20,562
But this is Vishnumaya, always very angry. 
Actually she’s very, very angry person.

70
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:28,591
When she gets angry, she tries to show her anger.

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,381
So as it is, you know, it is part and parcel of me,

72
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:35,847
but my own part and parcel suggests –

73
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,474
 like, supposing there’s something burning,

74
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,456
and I put my foot on that.

75
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:45,521
It suggests, my foot suggests me that this is hot,

76
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:49,045
better not put your foot. It’s like that.

77
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:53,062
So let us see how the puja works out today.

78
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,392
It’s a great challenge to all of us.

79
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:58,721
Let us do it with shraddha, don’t have ashraddha,

80
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:01,434
 then it will work out, I’m sure it will work out.

81
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,614
You are my better children

82
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,246
May God bless you.
