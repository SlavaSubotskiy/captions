1
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,750
Tonight we have
gathered here

2
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,999
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

3
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,875
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

4
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,583
or Durga.

5
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,417
So many types of
forms She has taken,

6
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,875
to kill

7
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:13,917
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

8
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,750
or to obstruct,

9
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:20,917
or even to grow

10
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:25,792
the people who were

11
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,458
gentle and good.

12
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,834
Her forms are of
different types

13
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,917
that we know about,

14
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,500
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

15
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,166
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

16
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,750
Also we do not know

17
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,625
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

18
00:05:54,875 --> 00:06:00,417
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

19
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,959
And that’s how
they all survived

20
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,999
the ill-blood plan,

21
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,250
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

22
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,542
and evil people.

23
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,834
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

24
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:26,834
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

25
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:35,041
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

26
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:39,583
When they are

27
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:45,417
born evil, you can
make them out.

28
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,709
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

29
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,291
and so vindictive

30
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,250
about things.

31
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,333
But hatred has no limit,

32
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:05,458
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

33
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,083
if they hate someone,

34
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:15,917
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

35
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:21,500
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

36
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,834
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

37
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,834
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

38
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:33,458
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

39
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:38,917
to form a joint
personality of evil,

40
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:44,333
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

41
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:49,792
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

42
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:55,417
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

43
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,834
and for such persons

44
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:06,250
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

45
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,875
These are to be
destroyed.

46
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,583
And that is the job
of the Goddess

47
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:18,000
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

48
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:23,208
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

49
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:28,834
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

50
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:36,500
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

51
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,458
But they do not.

52
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,542
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

53
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,875
go to hell for some
time, suffer

54
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,792
and, again, they come
back much more strong

55
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:54,583
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

56
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,709
It’s a common style

57
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:04,166
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

58
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,625
of a very good man,

59
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:11,500
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

60
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,834
or they can also say
that they can

61
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,625
give you Realisation.

62
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,458
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

63
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:28,250
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

64
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,542
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

65
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,500
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

66
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,208
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

67
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,208
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

68
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,625
We’ve had many of
these false people

69
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,125
and many stupid
people followed them.

70
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,417
They never talked
against each other.

71
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,667
Christ has said that,

72
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,667
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

73
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:08,166
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

74
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,250
and they cannot talk,

75
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:16,417
they cannot talk
of something

76
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,875
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

77
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,667
The fraternity is so
great that,

78
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,792
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

79
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,834
that they are together.
Just imagine.

80
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,999
all the evil people
should join together

81
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,417
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

82
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,792
That way, they are
very collective.

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,583
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

84
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,250
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

85
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,625
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

86
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,458
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

87
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,917
to destroy all the
creation of God,

88
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,166
all the good people
of the world,

89
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:12,041
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

90
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,125
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

91
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,250
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

92
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,834
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

93
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,041
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

94
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:37,291
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

95
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:41,709
while the good people
also sometimes

96
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,250
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

97
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,000
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

98
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,500
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

99
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,625
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

100
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,834
And then they go on
justifying all the time

101
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,542
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

102
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,083
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

103
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:14,083
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

104
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:19,875
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

105
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,750
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

106
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,041
who are exposed.

107
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,250
People have exposed
them so much

108
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
that nobody can expose

109
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,917
anybody without any proof.

110
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,166
But they have such courage

111
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,375
and they are so
full of confidence

112
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,917
that they can do
what they like,

113
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,583
and anybody tries
to expose them,

114
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:56,667
they will definitely
ruin that person.

115
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,125
A few things they
are doing.

116
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,834
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

117
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,125
They say that:
"We are very

118
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,667
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

119
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,667
All sorts of things they will talk.

120
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,458
But there is no proof
about it.

121
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,792
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

122
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,458
as to: “How do you say?

123
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,667
What is the proof? ”

124
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,000
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

125
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:32,291
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

126
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,458
Then you grow into it.

127
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,709
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

128
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,041
You have to mature.

129
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,458
It takes some time
for some people.

130
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,917
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

131
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,083
But you do mature.

132
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,875
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

133
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,458
then there is
no possibility,

134
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,250
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

135
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,959
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

136
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,917
If they fall,
they fall so low.

137
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,000
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

138
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,500
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

139
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,792
So, with all these
things happening,

140
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,166
what is our job

141
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,959
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

142
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,875
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

143
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,208
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

144
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,667
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

145
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,875
in whatever peril you
may be,

146
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,250
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

147
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

148
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,166
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

149
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,709
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

150
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,542
It’s this thing: that
they should know

151
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,250
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

152
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,875
She exists within you.

153
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,999
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

154
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,583
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

155
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,792
With due respect,
you must know

156
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:23,417
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

157
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,999
She is very sensitive.

158
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,834
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

159
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,875
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

160
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,417
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

161
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,417
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

162
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,792
But if you do not repent

163
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:46,375
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

164
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,458
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

165
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,834
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

166
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,500
I would say…

167
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,792
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

168
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,208
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

169
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:34,709
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

170
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:39,417
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

171
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:43,792
May do something that
is not good for you,

172
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,875
could be very dangerous
for you.

173
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,208
But She is the person
who guides

174
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,583
how to avoid all
the dangers.

175
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:57,500
Now, She protects
your life,

176
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,750
She protects your body,

177
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,999
She protects all organs
of your body,

178
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:08,250
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

179
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,625
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

180
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,667
You are never afraid
of anything.

181
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:21,625
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

182
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,917
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

183
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:29,917
But if you are under
Her beautiful

184
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,959
guidance and Her
blessings,

185
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,417
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

186
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,166
You will never do
anything wrong also.

187
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,208
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

188
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
She is really the
guiding person.

189
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,250
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

190
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:55,125
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

191
00:17:55,542 --> 00:18:02,959
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

192
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,375
She gives us so many things.
For example,

193
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:15,917
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

194
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,542
She gives you the Truth.

195
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,625
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

196
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,250
Sometimes people

197
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,875
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

198
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,750
“What I think is
the truth.”

199
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:35,041
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

200
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:39,291
a kind of a confusion,

201
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,999
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

202
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:48,625
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

203
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,083
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

204
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,875
puts you to illusions
and She

205
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,625
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

206
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,458
She is the One who
relaxes you,

207
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,041
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

208
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,500
She takes over all
your problems.

209
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,959
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

210
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:14,500
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

211
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,709
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

212
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,709
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

213
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:28,166
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

214
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,834
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

215
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:37,583
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

216
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,667
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

217
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,083
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

218
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,709
You are not accepting Her.

219
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,125
Worrying is something
very common

220
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,041
and people take great
pride in saying:

221
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,542
“Oh, I was worried.”

222
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,542
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

223
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,500
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

224
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,458
She knows how
to manage things.

225
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:06,750
And when you are like
a child before Her,

226
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,333
how can you worry
about anything?

227
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,125
So your worries
are finished.

228
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,417
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

229
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:20,333
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

230
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,709
She is so secure
Herself, that

231
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,959
She gives you all the
security that you need.

232
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,792
You can hold on
to Her feet.

233
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:35,250
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

234
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,417
You can even pray to Her.

235
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,709
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

236
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,917
Because She cures you.

237
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,083
She can cure your
diseases,

238
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,999
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

239
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:55,250
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

240
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:59,959
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

241
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,291
She likes enlightened
persons.

242
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,999
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

243
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:13,667
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

244
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:19,041
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

245
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,500
but especially in the
West they use them.

246
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,250
They have big teeth
and they

247
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,041
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

248
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,999
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

249
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:39,166
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

250
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:45,166
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

251
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:50,458
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

252
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,125
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

253
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,500
Mahakali has departed
from them.

254
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:03,709
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

255
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:08,208
And such people are
attacked by these people

256
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,125
who know they are afraid.

257
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,667
The Sun itself is
very important,

258
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,583
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

259
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:22,417
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

260
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,208
we are very hard-working

261
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:31,083
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

262
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:35,667
All this we do,
worship the Sun

263
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:39,041
and also go right-sided
very much.

264
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,875
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

265
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,458
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

266
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:50,375
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

267
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:55,999
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

268
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,667
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

269
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,500
Then we get upset

270
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,667
and we don’t know
what to do.

271
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:11,709
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

272
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:16,709
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

273
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,750
and She takes away
our problems.

274
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,959
So many things
She is doing.

275
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,709
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

276
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,291
Main thing is,

277
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:34,667
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

278
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:40,917
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

279
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,792
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

280
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:49,999
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

281
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,542
from all the evil.

282
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,041
But it has to be
understood, those who are

283
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:02,208
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

284
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:08,709
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

285
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,917
can be attacked.

286
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:17,667
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

287
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,417
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

288
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,875
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

289
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:30,834
in very dangerous times.

290
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,166
Whence anything
can happen.

291
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,208
So we have to be
very careful.

292
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,750
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

293
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,458
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

294
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,291
Try to understand

295
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:52,542
what is the plan of
this evil person,

296
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:56,000
that you are playing
into his hands?

297
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,500
How can you play
into his hands

298
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:02,959
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

299
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,709
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

300
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,458
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

301
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,792
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

302
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:17,458
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

303
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,667
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

304
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:25,417
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

305
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:30,500
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

306
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,166
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

307
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,333
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

308
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,166
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

309
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,999
They can’t leave
you for even…

310
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:01,375
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

311
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,999
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

312
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,041
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

313
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,709
and She looks after
you much more

314
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:15,333
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

315
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:19,291
You are not very much...

316
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,291
trying to play your
ego on others.

317
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,583
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

318
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,999
She definitely will
help you.

319
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:34,750
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

320
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,834
because he is
the worst enemy

321
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,083
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

322
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,458
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

323
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:52,083
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

324
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,834
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

325
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,999
We have to be innocent.

326
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:02,500
Means: we are not
planning to do something

327
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,583
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

328
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:15,667
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

329
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,875
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

330
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,792
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

331
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,375
Nothing of the kind!

332
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:28,166
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

333
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:32,041
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

334
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,500
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

335
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,583
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

336
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:48,250
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

337
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,959
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

338
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:56,458
How they make
all kinds of,

339
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:02,291
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

340
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,375
also tell lies!

341
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,208
All kinds of things
they will do

342
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,208
and they expect so
much from you also.

343
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:15,291
But all this is
happening… is happening.

344
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,375
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

345
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,583
You should keep
to your innocence

346
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:24,166
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

347
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:30,041
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

348
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,250
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

349
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:39,083
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

350
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:44,333
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

351
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:49,375
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

352
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,999
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

353
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:56,792
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

354
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:00,667
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

355
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,500
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

356
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:09,542
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

357
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,750
is going to really
help you very much,

358
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:18,667
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

359
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,959
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

360
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,999
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

361
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:33,375
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

362
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,709
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

363
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,250
She is always with you.

364
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,417
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

365
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,999
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

366
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:50,166
How many people
you are curing?

367
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,375
How many people
you are helping?

368
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,917
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

369
00:29:56,083 --> 00:30:00,583
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

370
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,917
that She knows
everything about you.

371
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,542
Everything! She knows
your mind.

372
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,500
She knows about
your heart.

373
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,583
She knows about
your health.

374
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:14,999
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

375
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:19,959
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

376
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,875
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

377
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,333
He’s very innocent.

378
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,999
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

379
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:33,999
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

380
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,959
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

381
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:42,291
educates you.
She gives you

382
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:47,041
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

383
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,959
But, looking after
the child in you,

384
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,583
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

385
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,458
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

386
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:03,041
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

387
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,792
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

388
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:09,250
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

389
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,458
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

390
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,166
and in no way they
should be hurt.

391
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,959
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

392
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:23,500
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

393
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,417
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

394
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,208
She is present
everywhere.

395
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,917
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

396
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:39,792
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

397
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,333
Everywhere,

398
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,125
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

399
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,291
She is there to save you.

400
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,291
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

401
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,041
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

402
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:59,041
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

403
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,750
but for Her blessings.

404
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,999
Her blessings are
very great

405
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:09,792
and they really have
enriched human beings.

406
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:14,000
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

407
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,250
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

408
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,333
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

409
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,917
Her thing is that,

410
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:28,500
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

411
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:33,333
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

412
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,999
and a kind of a feeling

413
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:41,333
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

414
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,917
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

415
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,583
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

416
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,083
always think like that.

417
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:55,834
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

418
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,250
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

419
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:02,542
which is the principle
of the Goddess

420
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:07,208
of ‘Ascent’.

421
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:12,291
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

422
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,583
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

423
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:21,667
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

424
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,041
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

425
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,208
All such fundamental
questions start rising

426
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:33,834
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

427
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,542
In that also, you
have to understand

428
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,000
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

429
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,959
very different from what
people understand.

430
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,625
They think -if
they are seeking,

431
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,500
it should be intelligible,

432
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,667
it should be through
their mindsall this…

433
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,083
or could be rational

434
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,458
or scientific.

435
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:59,750
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

436
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,417
It’s not possible!

437
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,166
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

438
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,959
that you should have earnest

439
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:12,625
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

440
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,999
When you think like that,

441
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,417
then you will not take
to other things.

442
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,625
So many people took to drugs,

443
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:23,999
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

444
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,583
It’s a wrong idea.

445
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:30,792
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

446
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,250
Awareness is the most
important thing.

447
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,208
If you can go

448
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:42,458
into the realm
of awareness,

449
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:47,208
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

450
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,417
If your basic awareness
is lost,

451
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:53,999
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

452
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,250
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

453
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:03,667
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

454
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:07,750
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

455
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,709
that you want
to revenge yourself

456
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:14,542
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

457
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,834
It’s not the real seeking.

458
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,999
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

459
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,500
and should find out
what is the right way.

460
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,333
But, that too, not by
reading some books

461
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,083
or listening to
some false gurus.

462
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:35,583
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

463
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:39,291
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

464
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:43,583
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

465
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,709
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

466
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,208
then to that place,
then more to that place.

467
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,709
Then this has
to be done…

468
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,125
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

469
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:57,750
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

470
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:01,208
Moving from false

471
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,417
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

472
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:09,041
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

473
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,792
So many have been
lost, because

474
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:19,375
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

475
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,333
seeking is very ‘precious’,

476
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,917
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

477
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,041
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

478
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,834
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

479
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,166
That means that.

480
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:37,583
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

481
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,999
The people who are

482
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:44,500
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

483
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:48,417
But such people try to
gather round a person,

484
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,542
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

485
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:56,166
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

486
00:36:56,667 --> 00:37:01,125
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

487
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,583
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

488
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:10,250
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

489
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,083
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

490
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,917
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

491
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:19,500
“You can pay him
half the amount:

492
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:23,000
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

493
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,709
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

494
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,208
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

495
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,875
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

496
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,667
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

497
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,041
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

498
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:41,417
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

499
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,667
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

500
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:45,542
“That’s the thing”
she said,

501
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,917
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

502
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:55,417
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

503
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:59,999
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

504
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:05,083
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

505
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,250
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

506
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,166
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

507
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,375
And you cannot take
money for that.

508
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:23,208
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

509
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,834
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

510
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,041
And Mahalakshmi power is

511
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,542
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

512
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:39,917
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

513
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:45,291
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

514
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,709
spontaneous Realisation.

515
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:53,166
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

516
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:57,500
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

517
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:01,999
All those things are over.
You have done it.

518
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,792
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

519
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,542
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

520
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:10,875
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

521
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,375
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

522
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,500
and it is spreading
very fast.

523
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:23,041
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

524
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,999
Now, this one is

525
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:32,333
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

526
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:36,417
both go hand in hand.

527
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:40,917
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

528
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:44,667
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

529
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,792
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

530
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:50,709
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

531
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:55,250
and also to improve
your problems,

532
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:59,417
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

533
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,375
or in any way other

534
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,709
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

535
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:11,625
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

536
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:15,125
So, there is no competition
between Them.

537
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,959
All these three powers
work together,

538
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,999
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

539
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,875
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

540
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:34,375
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

541
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:41,041
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

542
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,999
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

543
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,291
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

544
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,166
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

545
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:57,917
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

546
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,583
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

547
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:06,875
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

548
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,999
You must mature in
such a manner that

549
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:16,333
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

550
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:20,417
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

551
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:24,542
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

552
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:28,875
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

553
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:33,583
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

554
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:37,875
with each evil man,
evildoer.

555
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,458
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

556
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,625
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

557
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,542
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

558
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:53,083
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

559
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,542
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

560
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,542
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

561
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,917
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

562
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,458
that unless and until
you point it out,

563
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:07,917
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

564
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:12,583
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

565
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:16,375
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

566
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:21,333
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

567
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:26,625
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

568
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,875
Anywhere: you may
be having

569
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:33,792
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

570
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:37,667
but She exists within
you all the time.

571
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,375
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

572
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,458
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

573
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:49,000
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

574
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,834
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

575
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:55,542
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

576
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:56,750
but you will feel ‘bad’,

577
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,959
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

578
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,417
And then you will
try to correct it.

579
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,083
All this works out

580
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,000
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

581
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,417
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

582
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:20,875
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

583
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:26,083
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

584
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:31,875
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

585
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:35,667
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

586
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,709
worships and loves
his mother.

587
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:41,792
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

588
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,709
how we should love
our Mother and

589
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:50,333
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

590
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:54,208
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

591
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:57,333
and that childhood has
to come back in you

592
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:00,375
if you really
worship the Mother.

593
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,834
May God Bless you.
