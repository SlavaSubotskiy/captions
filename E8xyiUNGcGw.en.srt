1
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:14,475
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:45,766
As you know Shri Krishna is the incarnation of Vishnu.

3
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:59,267
And Vishnu is the one who is the preserver of this universe.

4
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:04,559
When this whole world was created

5
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,891
it was necessary

6
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:19,392
to create a preserver also

7
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,766
because this world would have been destroyed

8
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:28,683
and completely if it is left alone without a preserver,

9
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,517
then the way human beings are,

10
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,933
they could have done anything to this world.

11
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,766
But so, Vishnu is the preserver.

12
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:47,683
He's the preserver and He's the only one really incarnates.

13
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,475
Of course,

14
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,017
sometimes Brahmadeva also incarnated,

15
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,392
but He only takes forms.

16
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:59,599
In our evolutionary process He has taken different forms.

17
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:04,850
He came on this earth in different ways.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,725
But still He had, as you say,

19
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,517
twelve

20
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:26,600
up to twelve was Shri Rama and up through ten He was there.

21
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:39,392
So He created also an atmosphere of the many great prophets

22
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:46,058
around Himself so that they could preserve the dharma

23
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,058
of this universe.

24
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:56,600
So the basis of preservation was dharma,

25
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,850
which has got, as you know,

26
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:10,599
the most important basic foundation for spiritual life.

27
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:17,058
In this dharma whatever was to be established

28
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:19,392
was to be established balance.

29
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:23,725
Was a habit with people to go to extremes in anything.

30
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:30,267
So He created a balance within us.

31
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:36,142
The first principal of dharma was to create balance.

32
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:39,017
If a person doesn't have a balance

33
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,058
then he cannot achieve his ascent.

34
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,683
As simple as that.

35
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,434
If you don't have a balance in your airplane it cannot ascend.

36
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:54,933
If you don't have a balance, say on a ship, it won't move.

37
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,267
In the same way,

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,475
first the human beings had to achieve the balance.

39
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,267
But they are born with different capacities,

40
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,850
with different capabilities.

41
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:16,683
As said that, "Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Jhati rupena samstita",

42
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:19,434
means the aptitudes are different.

43
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:22,058
They are born with different aptitudes,

44
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,142
with different faces, with different colors,

45
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,309
because variety was to be created.

46
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,267
If everybody looked the same, you see they would be looking

47
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,142
like some robots or something.

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,850
So everybody was created in a different way,

49
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:41,599
according to the country,

50
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,058
according to the parents.

51
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:52,517
All this was organized by the principal of Shri Vishnu,

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,309
that He created this world in different varieties.

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,517
He gave variety, and Shri Krishna is the master of it.

54
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,475
At the time when Shri Krishna came,

55
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,808
people were extremely serious type

56
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,683
and had become very ritualistic.

57
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,392
The reason was that Rama came and He talked of maryadas,

58
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,850
and these maryadas made people extremely,

59
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,309
extremely austere type.

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,392
In that austerity people lost the sense of joy,

61
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,808
sense of beauty, sense of variety.

62
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,683
So the Shri Krishna's incarnation

63
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,434
came as we call it the Sampurna,

64
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,267
it's complete because He has 16 petals.

65
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:59,933
As the moon has 16 kalas He too had 16 petals

66
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:06,850
so He's Sampurna and He is what we call is the Purnima,

67
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,641
is the full moon.

68
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:18,725
With this completeness of His incarnation,

69
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:25,975
of Vishnu's incarnation from Vishnu to many other incarnations

70
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:30,933
He came as the complete incarnation;

71
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:37,267
the total of Shri Vishnu was manifested.

72
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:45,517
So whatever was lacking in Rama's incarnation,

73
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,392
He brought it forth.

74
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,975
As you know that on the center - on the right heart

75
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,975
you have twelve petals.

76
00:06:56,434 --> 00:07:00,309
With this He showed so many things

77
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,434
which people miss completely,

78
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:09,058
because, unfortunately, Gita was written down.

79
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,559
When Gita was written down,

80
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:19,267
people started following the book word by word, not understanding.

81
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:26,309
And in the Gita His message was never for peace.

82
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,267
He didn't say you should be peaceful.

83
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,392
It was something like Jihad.

84
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:35,933
That He said that to Arjuna, "You have to fight.

85
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:40,434
At this time you have to fight for dharma,

86
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:43,933
for the truth and you have to fight."

87
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,683
Then He said, "I can't kill my uncles

88
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:50,641
and I can't kill my grandfather and I can't kill my relations."

89
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:56,058
He said, "Who, who are you killing, they're already dead."

90
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,183
Because they have no dharma.

91
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:02,559
If you have no dharma then you are already dead.

92
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,392
So what is there to kill or not to kill

93
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,434
and that is what today we see in modern times,

94
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:15,309
especially America which is the country of Vishuddhi.

95
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:19,309
They have no dharma so they're already dead

96
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,309
under dope or whatever you may call it,

97
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,517
under fear of all kinds of diseases.

98
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:30,183
They are already dead and whom are you going to kill?

99
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:38,975
And this message was in Kurukshetra He gave to Arjuna.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,392
But then he said, "You have asked me to kill these people

101
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,975
because I have Dharma in me. I am killing them, alright,

102
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,725
but what beyond this?"

103
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,683
What is beyond that?

104
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,100
So He describes Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,975
Beyond this was Sahaja Yoga.

106
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:09,058
Was, first He describes in the second chapter

107
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,058
who is the Stitha Pragya,

108
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,600
is the man who is balanced.

109
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,683
Then he says that such a man is never angry.

110
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,683
He doesn't get angry.

111
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,058
Inside he is absolutely at peace.

112
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,559
So what He described later on is really the modern times,

113
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:39,392
or we can say our Sahaja Yoga

114
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:44,517
in which He said how a person should become.

115
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:50,434
He didn't write, or He didn't say how to become that,

116
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:55,891
but the description is just like Christ I think where He says that

117
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,100
if you somebody slaps you on one face you put the

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,183
other side of the face.

119
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,475
All this is actually description of Sahaja Yogis

120
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,766
of the future.

121
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:15,891
Not at that time when Khauravas were fighting the Pandavas.

122
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:17,600
It was not at that time.

123
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,766
During that fight He told him

124
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:33,267
that if you become a Stitha Pragya then you can transcend

125
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:35,600
all these problems,

126
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:40,142
all these understandings that you have,

127
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,933
and you become absolutely peaceful with yourself.

128
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:50,392
So on one side He said you have to fight.

129
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,808
Now in modern times we do not have to fight Kauravas,

130
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,725
there are no Kauravas

131
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:00,933
The five Pandavas have to fight the Khauravas.

132
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:06,017
So now what are these five Pandavas?

133
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,975
They are our senses

134
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:13,600
or we can call they are the cosmos,

135
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:19,641
divided into various elements.

136
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:23,725
One side. They have to fight,

137
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,600
they have to fight the Kauravas

138
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,725
which are within us.

139
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,599
Now there are hundred Kauravas, not one.

140
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:38,183
It is, if you extend it

141
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:42,683
then we can say the nature has to fight

142
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,683
something that is against the nature.

143
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,309
Now people will say anger is natural,

144
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,309
getting annoyed is natural,

145
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,225
to be aggressive is natural.

146
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,641
It is not.

147
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:05,725
Anger and all these things may have been natural,

148
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:16,183
but now we must know that we have the natural capacity to ascend.

149
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,183
Is natural to go higher.

150
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:24,434
It is natural to be Stitha pragya.

151
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,600
It is natural to be Sahaja Yogi.

152
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,100
This is also built in us, in us.

153
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,309
For example a seed is a seed.

154
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,183
When it is seed we call it seed.

155
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,350
Alright, naturally is to be seed,

156
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,975
but then it sprouts and becomes the tree.

157
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:45,725
So it is also natural in a seed

158
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,975
that all that future,

159
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,225
all the thousands of trees

160
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:56,725
it is going to be is also in that seed.

161
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,350
And now as you know they're experimenting that

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,766
in one seed you can get thousand

163
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:07,975
minimum of thousands of little, little sprouts in one seed

164
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:12,350
and which can be made all of them into trees or plants.

165
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,183
This is a new thing that has come up.

166
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:20,475
So when He said that

167
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,850
you have to become a Stitha pragya

168
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:27,766
what He was trying to say that you should achieve your balance.

169
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,975
Now this He told,

170
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,183
there was a war on.

171
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,225
When they were warring,

172
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,766
alright, you have to do it.

173
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,559
If you have to war with people,

174
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,559
if you have to kill them it's all right.

175
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,183
But afterwards,

176
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,434
once that is over

177
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:54,641
then what you have to do is to build up your spiritual sense.

178
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:02,225
Now the building up of the spiritual sense

179
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:07,350
is our work and that's what we have to do.

180
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,891
Not only dharma.

181
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:17,183
Many Sahaja Yogis think that they are going in dharma

182
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,975
so they are alright.

183
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:21,183
They are working in dharma,

184
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,309
they are living in a dharmic life.

185
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,517
They are. I'm very surprised and happy that they are doing it.

186
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,600
But that's not the end of it.

187
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,600
That's the balance part

188
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,225
where you are balancing yourself.

189
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:39,058
Now, what you have to do is to go ahead

190
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:42,891
and build up your spiritual self and spread it.

191
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,766
This is the work of Shri Krishna also

192
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,725
because He's the one who communicates all over.

193
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,766
As you know America is communicating everywhere

194
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,641
in a wrong way - but it is.

195
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,100
It has got computers,

196
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,350
it has got this,

197
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,725
all communication things it has done

198
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:05,725
because it is innately built in them to communicate.

199
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:11,517
But because they don't believe in Shri Krishna,

200
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,309
neither in dharma,

201
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:16,517
so the basis itself is wrong,

202
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,517
and with this wrong basis they have started spreading.

203
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,225
With this very, very wrong basis

204
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,725
they have started spreading ah,

205
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:33,100
all kinds of filth and dirt and I don't know what to call it,

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,309
which is against human beings,

207
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,600
which is against our ascent,

208
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,766
which is against God.

209
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,017
And they are doing all this.

210
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:45,309
Why?

211
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Why are they doing which they are not supposed to do?

212
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,142
I think is the intellect.

213
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,641
Their intellect which is also,

214
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:08,434
I should say is the brain, which is the seat of Virat.

215
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:11,017
Can you imagine? Is the seat of Virat.

216
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:15,225
And with their intellect, what do they do?

217
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,434
They say it is natural.

218
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,142
It is natural to be adharmic.

219
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:27,475
It is natural to be aggressive.

220
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,641
It is natural to be money oriented.

221
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:34,891
Everything that they have is all natural

222
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,599
because according to them

223
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:44,559
with their intellect they have somehow or other managed

224
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:48,725
to convince through your rationality

225
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,891
that this is the correct thing to do.

226
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,641
Without this you cannot exist.

227
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,891
I mean this is supposed to be their culture now.

228
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,599
Now if that is the culture all over,

229
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,225
it's not only in America all over,

230
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:05,183
this sort of a nonsensical culture

231
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:08,434
is accepted because of the intellect.

232
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:10,725
They are much more intelligent.

233
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,100
You see a person who always thinks of money, this, that,

234
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,766
naturally becomes very intelligent

235
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,975
in the sense he becomes sharp.

236
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,309
He becomes smart.

237
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:23,434
He becomes smart, smart in a way,

238
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,100
something as if he knows everything.

239
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,475
He starts thinking he knows everything,

240
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,475
whatever he's doing he is right,

241
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,975
whatever the way he is behaving he is right.

242
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,891
So, these Pandavas which he has got within himself,

243
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,725
these elements that he has got,

244
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,559
he uses them for a purpose

245
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,309
which is destructive,

246
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,350
absolutely destructive - anti God.

247
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,559
And he is not aware

248
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:56,766
because his intelligence always justifies.

249
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,975
Whatever he's doing is justified.

250
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:08,225
And He has given also so much of brains to these intellectuals

251
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:13,309
that they also try to go against what is dharma.

252
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,017
For example, even Shri Krishna's life

253
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,559
they try to depict by saying

254
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:25,683
that Shri Krishna Himself had five wives

255
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,434
and He had sixteen wives later on.

256
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:30,766
Actually these were His power.

257
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,599
But without understanding what Shri Krishna was,

258
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,350
because intellect is such a gross nonsense

259
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:43,766
that it doesn't take you to the right thinking;

260
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,017
always to the wrong thinking,

261
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,309
it moves you because you want to justify

262
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,559
everything and this justification

263
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:56,142
makes you live with yourself.

264
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,100
Otherwise, normally,

265
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,142
you can't live with yourself.

266
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,267
It is very difficult to live

267
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:06,350
with a life which is adharmic,

268
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,641
which is aggressive,

269
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,058
which is, what you can call,

270
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,392
a war mongering type.

271
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:14,350
But they live.

272
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:18,850
So, all that is expected of a human being,

273
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,766
just the opposite of that,

274
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,559
juxtaposition of that,

275
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,559
is being done in all these western cultures.

276
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:31,933
You can see it clearly how they justify.

277
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:35,392
Immorality they can justify.

278
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,641
One Mr. Freud came in.

279
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,017
He replaced even Christ.

280
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,766
Of course, I mean, he had to because Christ was even more

281
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,641
strict than Mohammed sahib

282
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,808
who said anybody does anything with one eye,

283
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:53,267
with the eyes, he should take out one eye,

284
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:59,267
and anybody who's hand is spoiling him should,

285
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,891
he should cut his hand.

286
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:03,808
I mean most of the Europeans and Americans

287
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,225
would have been without one hand I think,

288
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:08,766
according to Christ.

289
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,100
Thank God they didn't follow Him to that point.

290
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:15,683
And, also Mohammed sahib thought

291
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:18,142
that Christ has done so much for the men,

292
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,225
why not we do something for the women also,

293
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,766
so He made something for women.

294
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:26,142
Both of them are too much for human beings.

295
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,683
They didn't realize it.

296
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,225
Who's going to take out one eye for that?

297
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,891
They have intellect.

298
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,808
Now, if they are looking at many women,

299
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:39,142
there's a justification - is natural.

300
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,350
Have you seen any animal behaving like that

301
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,392
if the animals are natural beings?

302
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:47,599
We are worse than animals.

303
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:54,559
And what a mess we have created with this kind of understanding

304
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,267
through these intellectuals

305
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:02,808
who are trying to tell us something, and we accept.

306
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,225
So this is one of the problems

307
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,559
is if there's an intelligent man, he dominates.

308
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,891
Now, for example, some fashion starts.

309
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:20,267
We all take it.

310
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:21,766
It's a fashion.

311
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:24,559
But why are you taking it? It's a fashion.

312
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,225
So, the intellect of an entrepreneur

313
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,017
can really befool you completely.

314
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,766
But not with people who are wise.

315
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:39,267
They will say, "Get lost, we have had all this."

316
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,599
This is about morality part.

317
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:52,142
That is the worst practiced in the West,

318
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:55,017
and worse than animals I should say.

319
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,559
And that's how they are suffering today.

320
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:00,392
They are suffering with so many diseases,

321
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:02,392
so many troubles, this, that.

322
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,891
Second thing which we always justify is violence.

323
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,309
Now there is no war going on in Kurukshetra.

324
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,475
But you see violence everywhere.

325
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:16,309
In America it's terrible.

326
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,850
When my daughter went she took out all her ornaments,

327
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,309
put it with Me.

328
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,641
She said, "Mummy, I can't carry this."

329
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,850
Nothing was given to the girl.

330
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,100
All artificial things were given

331
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,017
because you can be killed for it.

332
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,725
I'm not saying it's only in America. It's everywhere.

333
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,350
Because everybody's guru is America.

334
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,766
It starts from America,

335
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,766
the gurudom and people just follow blindly.

336
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:48,309
So the violence is now entering into our films,

337
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,350
Indian films also, but now they have taken some objection.

338
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,017
Maybe it is too much for us.

339
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,017
But this kind of thing that

340
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,641
you can kill anybody,

341
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,599
so if you go on like this,

342
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,641
you see if that is the criteria of greatness

343
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:12,267
then Rwanda people should be placed highest

344
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,017
in the evolutionary process.

345
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,599
Killing somebody is not allowed. Thou shalt not kill.

346
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,683
Muslims are killing.

347
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,267
Everbody's killing everyone.

348
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,017
The other day they killed a very nice man in India

349
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:31,766
for nothing at all.

350
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:35,725
This idea of aggressiveness

351
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:38,434
ultimately takes you to the killing part.

352
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:42,392
You can't even create one ant.

353
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,392
How can you kill human beings like that?

354
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,434
Of course, this killing business

355
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:54,100
is taken to the highest limit,

356
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,808
like Hitler believed that he was top of the world.

357
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,641
This is same,

358
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,683
that you just forget what you are

359
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,725
and you start assuming through your ego

360
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,933
that you are something very great.

361
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,267
Also, in Sahaja Yoga I find recently

362
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,725
there are some people who are saying they're gods,

363
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:18,183
they're deities, everything.

364
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:23,600
So this ego business

365
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:27,600
is actually taking energy of your intelligence,

366
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:30,434
and the greatest enemy of a human being is,

367
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,808
is his intelligence, I think,

368
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,725
because it's so limited,

369
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,808
it is so conditioned,

370
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,100
and it is so arrogant,

371
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,600
and it is so blind.

372
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,392
Wisdom is a different thing.

373
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,725
Wisdom you don't get in colleges,

374
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:50,808
schools, universities, nowhere.

375
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,725
Where do you get it, the wisdom?

376
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,683
You get it through your Spirit,

377
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,600
which gives you a complete idea

378
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,267
as to what is right and what is wrong.

379
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:09,100
Whatever is wrong will be accepted by intellect, always.

380
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:14,100
Intellect is not wisdom one must understand.

381
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:18,392
They're two things - wisdom and intellect.

382
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:23,434
Now Krishna was known to be the diplomat.

383
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,309
He had Divine diplomacy.

384
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,183
That means what?

385
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:30,183
He was very intelligent,

386
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,850
no doubt. Without that you can't do.

387
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:37,350
I've met some people who are very highly placed

388
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,017
who don't have much intelligence even,

389
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:46,267
but I have now seen that this intellect is a dangerous thing.

390
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,225
So Shri Krishna,

391
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,808
He used His intellect.

392
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,599
He is all powerful.

393
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,350
Nothing can dominate Him.

394
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,599
Even his intellect cannot dominate Him.

395
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,599
He used His intellect.

396
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,891
Difference between the two you should see.

397
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,975
You should be able to use your intellect

398
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:10,475
and not to be dominated by your intellect.

399
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:16,475
So He used His intellect by which He solved many problems.

400
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,599
His whole diplomacy was to use His intellect

401
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,766
and use it for the purpose of Divine.

402
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:28,975
All the time the Divine in Him

403
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:32,808
was helping Him to use His intellect.

404
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:37,350
So the difference is that we are slaves of our intellect

405
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:41,599
and He is the master of His intellect;

406
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,267
not only, everything.

407
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,434
His conditioning He is master,

408
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,142
His emotions He is master,

409
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,975
His body He's the master.

410
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,225
He's master of everything.

411
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,434
And when you master it you see your intellect very clearly,

412
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:02,142
oh, this is what it is suggesting.

413
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,850
This is not.

414
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,891
This intellect can give you very so-called positive ideas

415
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,975
that you are the lord of the whole world.

416
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:13,641
It's supposed to be positive.

417
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:16,599
Or the same intellect can give you ideas

418
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,683
that you are nothing.

419
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:24,850
This intellect plays on top of you.

420
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:29,517
Now you are not to be guided by your intellect,

421
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,392
but by your wisdom,

422
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,517
as you are Sahaja Yogis.

423
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,267
So, you have a very good instrument of feeling it-

424
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,392
through your vibrations you can make out

425
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,808
what is good and what is bad.

426
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,933
And you can see sometimes,

427
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,267
as being human beings,

428
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:51,475
there are some intellectual effects also coming in.

429
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,517
But with Sahaja Yoga you can judge,

430
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,600
what is this intellect telling you.

431
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,475
Because the intellect that you have has come out of what

432
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:05,142
is the main thing; should go to the subtle point

433
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,058
how this intellect has come to us.

434
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:15,017
This intellect has come to us because our brain became,

435
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:17,599
active very soon.

436
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:20,517
I've seen some children extremely intelligent,

437
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,891
but they have no wisdom.

438
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:29,017
If your - only the brain develops too much,

439
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:31,392
could be a mother is a very,

440
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:34,392
intelligent woman and,

441
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,683
father must be very intelligent,

442
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:38,517
inheritance would be great,

443
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,183
so they get it.

444
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,600
Or maybe the circumstances,

445
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:45,142
like if you are born in a particular country

446
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,183
you suddenly become very intelligent.

447
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,058
I've seen Americans, they read all the time.

448
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:52,600
All the time you see them reading.

449
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:54,267
Even English they read.

450
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,683
But what is the outcome of all that reading I don't know.

451
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,392
Every book they will read.

452
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,434
If you ask them what is a computer, they know the computers,

453
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,434
this thing, that thing, that thing, all the. . .

454
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:10,434
I don't know how to even put off my television.

455
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
If you ask them about television they will know they'll . . .

456
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,891
anything you want to know about mechanical things they will know.

457
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,058
Anything about politics they will know,

458
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,641
who's father was that and they will tell you that,

459
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,183
"No, no, no, no this is like this, this like that."

460
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:33,225
All this is avidya; is not knowledge. It is non-knowledge.

461
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,725
So they think they're very intelligent

462
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:40,434
because they know everything, about everything.

463
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,100
Now, with this intellect,

464
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,975
as this consciousness comes in they start creating

465
00:29:47,225 --> 00:29:49,766
very intellectual ideas.

466
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,309
Especially in America I have seen

467
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,975
they have got for children

468
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,725
all kinds of funny things just to extract money.

469
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:04,267
For example, there is a golliwog or something

470
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,559
which has a birthday.

471
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,267
Can you imagine?

472
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,183
A birthday is there and sometimes,

473
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:17,517
you see even the, people have big parties for that.

474
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,267
Then they started, let us have birthday of the dogs,

475
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:26,142
so they are having birthdays of the dogs.

476
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,392
Anybody who puts ideas into them.

477
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,850
Then there are organizations

478
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:34,600
where they say, "All right, when you are going to die,

479
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,517
you tell us what suit you want to wear,

480
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:41,058
what tie you want to wear, what shoes, what clothes,

481
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:42,933
then what, in of,

482
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:46,142
what kind of a coffin you want to go - plastic,

483
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:48,517
or wood, or this and that." I mean . . .

484
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,517
So it is to be prescribed

485
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,183
to such an extent that some people say,

486
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:57,058
"Put us in the ice, you see, so we'll be there."

487
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,434
The worst thing, I think,

488
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,600
especially in Europe, is

489
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:10,434
that they have nicely advertised and marketed

490
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:13,600
the thing of going for a holiday.

491
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:20,850
So, in Italy supposing a person doesn't go to holiday,

492
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,434
he'll say, "There's a crisis in my life."

493
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:25,600
"What?" "I couldn't go to holiday."

494
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,183
Then they said you must go there,

495
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:29,683
tan your faces,

496
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:33,683
stay there in hotels so, so many hotels have come up.

497
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,933
Everybody has to go out.

498
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:37,183
Especially I was surprised

499
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:39,808
the whole of Milan is closed for one month.

500
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:42,142
Nobody you can find there.

501
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:47,599
See, I think if they all go and live in jungles

502
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,975
would be a better idea.

503
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,725
They will learn much more

504
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,142
than to waste their time on the seashore.

505
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:55,183
They're spoiling all the seashores.

506
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:59,058
They have no respect for the sea which is their Father.

507
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,142
They have no respect for each other.

508
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:07,517
The women try to slim down and to look very nice

509
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:09,850
so that they could become nude there.

510
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:12,975
The whole industry is so bad.

511
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,975
I mean if, somebody says would you like to come to the seashore,

512
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,559
I would not go.

513
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:23,475
I would hate to go to a place to see so many stupid ladies

514
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,641
in the sun busy trying to tan themselves.

515
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:31,600
Now this stupid idea how could you accept if you are intelligent?

516
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:40,766
There are so many ideas prevalent today,

517
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:43,559
mostly coming from America, I must say,

518
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:48,725
that you people follow. As I said

519
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:51,766
that America is the guru of all the Eastern,

520
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:57,559
of all our European and English and all these people.

521
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:03,309
Now, then another thing happens.

522
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:07,225
You see the atmosphere in which you live.

523
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,975
Especially in England I have noticed.

524
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:12,766
They may be nothing, you know.

525
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:16,641
There was a garbage cleaner who came to our house

526
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:19,850
and we had that time with us a president

527
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,600
of the Hague high court, imagine, the world high court.

528
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:27,183
So, I told him, "You have to clear out all these things."

529
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:31,600
"It's too much!" As usual, you see they are very,

530
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:35,766
I don't know what to say, but, stupidly proud about themselves.

531
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:39,517
"You don't understand." I said, "How much do you want?"

532
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,683
I gave him ten pounds.

533
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,808
In those days ten pounds was a big thing.

534
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:45,142
He said, "You don't understand the laws,

535
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,600
you see you are all Indians, niggers, this that."

536
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,808
Then this gentleman who was in our house

537
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,599
he came out and he asked him,

538
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,350
"Why are you shouting here?"

539
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,808
"You nigger, you don't understand any laws."

540
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:01,600
He is the chairman of the world high court

541
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:04,517
and this stupid Englishman talking like that.

542
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,808
The English are really, in a way,

543
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:08,933
they are really dumb people

544
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,766
because their intelligence never told,

545
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,058
tells them that you are nothing.

546
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:15,766
What are you proud of?

547
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,599
Such dumb people they are.

548
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,183
I don't know it might have come frozen

549
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:24,183
with the cold or anything,

550
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:26,350
but they think they are very intelligent.

551
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,683
Their scholarship was all right,

552
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:32,017
but I was amazed that in the beginning of the scholarship

553
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:33,891
that they had, they said

554
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:36,267
that the black people are like beasts.

555
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,600
There are so many books written about it,

556
00:34:41,142 --> 00:34:43,392
and they accepted that black people are like beasts

557
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:45,350
while these people were living,

558
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,017
like I don't know what,

559
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,683
at the time when Black were much more advanced.

560
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:57,725
So, this kind of an idea when they have I see here also.

561
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:02,142
I can see this that English have,

562
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,309
they think no end of themselves.

563
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:09,392
But they don't understand they don't know anything.

564
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,808
They have no wisdom.

565
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,683
They lived in India for 300 years.

566
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,142
They never learned anything from India.

567
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:18,600
Can you imagine their wisdom part?

568
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,599
Their scholarship,

569
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,017
some of them,

570
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,017
but still ambiguous.

571
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,850
Say Bernard Shaw I think was very ambiguous.

572
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:32,850
I place him as a very great writer, but ambiguous.

573
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:37,600
And then comes the French, God save.

574
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:43,058
Now how have they denied Shri Krishna

575
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:48,142
you can see very clearly in French people.

576
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:53,517
French wanted to become the highest in diplomacy.

577
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:56,933
They lack diplomacy completely. Useless people.

578
00:35:57,808 --> 00:36:00,808
They made our telephone in India the way they have spoiled it.

579
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:05,725
So, they started a cult of drinking.

580
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:09,309
Now can you imagine Shri Krishna drinking all these things?

581
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,599
They have a dictionary on drinking on, everything.

582
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,392
There's books after books written.

583
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,599
I mean you imagine how could any evolved people

584
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:21,808
accept this kind of a nonsensical culture

585
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,058
that you must know what to drink,

586
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,975
what to buy, what to put in,

587
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,850
what sort of a tumblers to be put?

588
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:33,142
They are all tumblers, nothing but tumblers I think.

589
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:36,058
How could they accept such a thing

590
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:40,808
which is so stupid, is a social acceptance?

591
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:45,392
Prostitution is another social acceptance.

592
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:49,933
Morality-wise they have really denied completely

593
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:53,183
the principal of Shri Krishna.

594
00:36:56,808 --> 00:37:00,599
The way they have been ruining their people

595
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:05,517
and to beat up everything is racialism.

596
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:14,267
Can you think that for the skin you separate people?

597
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,725
On the contrary I would say the Black,

598
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,058
especially in India; they're much more evolved

599
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,599
than all the white skins put together,

600
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,267
because they have wisdom.

601
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:28,808
They are wiser people.

602
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:31,309
But these white skins,

603
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,309
they are going to - I mean,

604
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,183
how did they get America also?

605
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,350
They dominated so much, they conquered it,

606
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,891
they settled down there.

607
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:45,434
You saw yesterday, from Sierra Nevada you saw

608
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:48,475
how people believed in wisdom and how they lived.

609
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,350
They took away all their lands.

610
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,225
Everybody, you see, is now nicely the owner of America.

611
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,641
How? You are squatters.

612
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,058
You came from another country,

613
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:01,975
killed thousands and thousands of people

614
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:04,600
without feeling guilty about it.

615
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,225
That means they are not even human beings.

616
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,975
And nicely settled as Americans.

617
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:20,225
I don't know how this word 'America' has come,

618
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,559
but if it means "amar" they are not.

619
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:27,891
It means "a mericas" they are not.

620
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,350
Both ways I don't know how this word has come

621
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,017
and some sort of a, uh, meaning they attach to it,

622
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:41,434
but their intellect grew much more.

623
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:45,434
Why? Again, because of money orientation.

624
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't understand economics

625
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,267
and the way they have made this economics from their,

626
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:55,142
yarns which came out of their heads

627
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:57,683
has landed all the countries into recession,

628
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:01,517
all kinds of fraud and also mafia.

629
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:05,517
That is the outcome of this so-called economics they have.

630
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,933
Sahaj economics is very different.

631
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:14,850
We are not bound by all these nonsensical ideas

632
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,600
that are prevalent as economics.

633
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,434
Is nothing but exploitation.

634
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:23,434
Is marketing.

635
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:25,058
Is how to impress people,

636
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,434
how to sell things,

637
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,933
how to do this, how to do that.

638
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:32,267
All this is nothing but, I would say,

639
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,683
financial aggressiveness.

640
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,725
What about Shri Krishna?

641
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,599
He was the king and He lived like a king.

642
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:51,725
But also, He lived in a very humble abode

643
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:55,058
in Gokul.

644
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,017
He was not attached.

645
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:06,142
So the first thing is that the way they're attached to money,

646
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:12,267
any justification for getting money is all right.

647
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:15,683
Once we went to a hotel in India.

648
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:19,017
So we had some American friends

649
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,766
and as usual, I mean, you can't eat like Americans can,

650
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:25,142
you know. Is, Indians can't compete.

651
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,434
Can eat a lot.

652
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,850
So they were eating, eating, eating and,

653
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,434
but we couldn't cope with them, really, to be very frank,

654
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:34,225
I mean, we're no good.

655
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,350
After some time they said, "Have you finished?" I said, "Yes."

656
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:41,475
"All right..." they called the waiter,

657
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,766
"Pack this out." I said, "What?

658
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,975
Want to pack this for what?" "We paid for it."

659
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,309
"So you paid for it, but I mean...In India nobody will eat a food

660
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,309
which somebody else has eaten."

661
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,975
"No, you pack it."

662
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,142
And they had no shame about it;

663
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,599
so shameless. I said.

664
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,350
"We don't do this in India."

665
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,475
Said, "Why not?" I said,. "These are bad manners."

666
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:05,017
"But we've paid for it.

667
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,891
Once you've paid for it then there is no bad manners."

668
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,017
I said, "Ah, we don't want this to pack."

669
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,017
"We'll have it. We'll have it in the night.

670
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:15,766
We'll have it in the evening."

671
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:19,100
I was surprised that such miserly people

672
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,142
are saying that they are very rich

673
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:24,475
and they think no end of themselves; extremely miserly.

674
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:28,599
Americans are superficially nice, I must tell you.

675
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:32,475
On my experience is they are not like English

676
00:41:32,683 --> 00:41:34,641
that they look down upon everyone.

677
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,267
No you don't feel that way with them.

678
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,100
But they are very superficial.

679
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:43,475
You give them ten presents; they won't even give you one.

680
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:49,309
They have no sense at all; no shame about it.

681
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:54,559
Why? Because the whole thing is, 'we paid for it'.

682
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,475
I mean you go to any place,

683
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,142
any restaurant there or anything, you'll be amazed.

684
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:05,975
They pack things for you

685
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:08,309
if something is left over in America.

686
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:09,475
They do.

687
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,017
To that extent they can go in their miserliness

688
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:17,475
without any shame about it.

689
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,267
And miserliness is out of Sahaja Yoga.

690
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,641
You cannot be miserly.

691
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,017
You have to be generous.

692
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,309
You have to be giving.

693
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,225
You have to feel for others.

694
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:33,142
Is this the only way we can express ourselves.

695
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,225
All this generosity

696
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:40,142
is not to create a big sort of a hero out of you.

697
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,641
But the worst and the worst and the worst is the Hollywood.

698
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,641
Is the film industry.

699
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:57,017
Under the name of industry you can do anything.

700
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,142
Now this Hollywood is creating such horrible films,

701
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,641
but the worst is that they get awards for these worst films.

702
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:15,725
There's one film they showed, I've not seen, I can't see it.

703
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,434
They told Me that a man is a cannibal

704
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,309
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

705
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,017
and they have shown but they enjoy.

706
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:30,309
Very, very famous. Apart from that,

707
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,766
not only famous, but they got awards for the best film,

708
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:36,434
the best actor, the best...

709
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:39,975
You must get a director from there

710
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,975
and make him eat the flesh of human beings.

711
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:46,434
It's the only way, I think this horrible thing...

712
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:48,641
Then they are producing other pictures.

713
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,891
I've seen another one for a short time

714
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:55,017
where they shows all dead bodies hanging you see.

715
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:56,475
Horrible!

716
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:02,891
Why these people like to see such horrible things?

717
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,766
What is their character?

718
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:08,309
Where have they gone?

719
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:13,225
Why do they enjoy things which no human being

720
00:44:13,225 --> 00:44:16,599
who is a human being will enjoy?

721
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:21,766
And then it goes further.

722
00:44:22,017 --> 00:44:24,142
Their halloween business - I saw a film,

723
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:27,434
I said, "My God." This is a hell in which

724
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:32,100
they thought it was like the wrath of Shri Krishna.

725
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,641
So it was Krishna consciousness I think

726
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:37,350
that was working there.

727
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:42,309
There are thousand and one things which can shock you in America,

728
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:47,350
and also in England, also in Europe.

729
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:52,641
I thought Austria was something better,

730
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,600
but in Austria when you walk on the road

731
00:44:56,975 --> 00:44:58,850
in the night after the program

732
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,725
you must take darshan of many horrible women there on the way.

733
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,559
I mean this is no where...

734
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:07,183
you know they're, we're forced into it.

735
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,641
And they can't do anything about it

736
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:13,725
as if it's a matter of right, you see,

737
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:17,017
what you call that of human right

738
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:19,183
to see such women,

739
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:22,017
and human right for these women to be on the street.

740
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,599
All horrible things are happening around,

741
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:29,183
so Sahaja Yogis have to equip themselves much more

742
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,183
with a Shri Krishna's principle.

743
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:34,891
The first principle is communication.

744
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:40,100
First principle is how you communicate with others.

745
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:43,100
Start it at home with your children,

746
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,350
with your wife, with your husband,

747
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,641
how you communicate.

748
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:49,725
Are you gentle?

749
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:51,434
Are you kind?

750
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:56,434
Are you dominating, aggressive?

751
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:58,891
Just try to find out.

752
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:04,475
It can go to any limit this aggressiveness,

753
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,725
either of the women or of the men.

754
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:10,225
Here more women I must say, I'm sorry to say.

755
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:13,725
But in my experience I've seen the women are very dominating.

756
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:16,475
In India men are extremely dominating,

757
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:19,641
but here I find the women are.

758
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,434
Now the basics

759
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:33,725
as human beings should have good manners.

760
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:38,475
I don't find good manners,

761
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:41,850
except that they wear good dresses, maybe the...

762
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:46,100
they might be wearing those special type of dresses and all that.

763
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,850
All manners are in dresses,

764
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:54,309
but when there are people together

765
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,183
they talk nothing but scandal.

766
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:03,434
I mean, unbearably, horrible scandals they discuss.

767
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,100
This is something one has to understand

768
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,058
that Shri Krishna never talked of scandals.

769
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,017
How can this, the country of Shri Krishna

770
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:21,725
and all other these European countries

771
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:28,350
are just very equipped with all the scandals of the world?

772
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,183
I just can't understand what is the interest

773
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,309
people have in the scandals.

774
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,017
So to top it all is your media

775
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:42,475
which is absolutely anti Shri Krishna

776
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,100
because they have to make money.

777
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,225
It's such a hand in glove business

778
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,100
that the people like to hear all this nonsense,

779
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,350
so they have scandals in the newspaper.

780
00:47:56,891 --> 00:47:58,766
At least about thirty years back

781
00:47:59,058 --> 00:48:01,600
you could never hear such a thing

782
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:07,559
and all such books were completely banned.

783
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:13,475
And now, suddenly, the whole thing has flowered so well

784
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,100
that any magazine, anything you take,

785
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,600
and you can't understand

786
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:22,225
what are they preaching.

787
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,975
They are preaching the cult of destruction completely.

788
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,100
And people take it, and like it, and work it out.

789
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,600
They are using the women for their own purpose

790
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,309
and stupidly women accept it.

791
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:42,683
Of course they dominate,

792
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:45,559
on one side feel very happy that they are dominating.

793
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:50,808
There was a lady who was boasting in one magazine

794
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,641
that she has had four hundred men in her life.

795
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:55,600
Can you imagine?

796
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,599
Now there is no place for hell for such a woman even.

797
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:03,392
Where will you put such a woman there?

798
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,766
Now I don't know; that's another problem.

799
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:18,267
So this movement,

800
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:23,600
which is absolutely against the principle of dharma

801
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:26,683
and of communication.

802
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:30,600
Now how you must communicate

803
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,434
decently,

804
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,434
with very tender

805
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:41,725
and very beautiful mannerism

806
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:45,933
you have to talk to another person,

807
00:49:46,392 --> 00:49:48,683
talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

808
00:49:49,142 --> 00:49:50,850
talk to anyone,

809
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,517
is in a very sweet manner you should talk.

810
00:49:54,517 --> 00:49:57,766
I do not mean the French style, you see,

811
00:49:57,766 --> 00:50:01,891
bending your body and all artificial stuff. Not that.

812
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:06,975
I'm saying that if you are naturally talking to somebody,

813
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:10,975
you should talk with decent language,

814
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:16,100
with decency, with humility

815
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,641
and need not go on jabbering all the time

816
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,225
and talking too much. There's no need.

817
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:24,850
But, on the contrary,

818
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:27,559
this was the style was Shri Krishna.

819
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:30,725
In short, His power was madhurya;

820
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:34,100
is the sweetness, like the honey.

821
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:39,559
When you are worshiping Shri Krishna

822
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:42,434
you have to know that you must talk

823
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:47,475
in a manner that will please another person.

824
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,309
So, while talking to anyone

825
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,725
you can talk very sweetly,

826
00:51:11,183 --> 00:51:16,225
very nicely and in a way which will please that person,

827
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:17,725
not to provoke,

828
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:20,309
not to say things which are hard.

829
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:22,766
But some people have a habit

830
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:27,850
of saying all the time something which is very provoking,

831
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,183
which is not at all good.

832
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:35,183
But some people are,

833
00:51:37,058 --> 00:51:40,766
when it comes to their business are very sweet,

834
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:45,309
but when it comes to something else they are very harsh.

835
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:48,350
We have a Jain community in India.

836
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,350
I've seen many Jains.

837
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,975
When they are for their business

838
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,225
they're the sweetest you could know,

839
00:51:55,933 --> 00:52:01,559
but when it comes to something else

840
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,725
like donating some money or something,

841
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:07,559
they're extremely hard.

842
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,725
They will only donate for stupid things,

843
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,766
but not for something sensible.

844
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:17,309
They'll work for something extremely stupid,

845
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,434
but never for anything sensible.

846
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:24,058
We have another community called as Sindhis.

847
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,766
I think they are under the influence of the West.

848
00:52:27,142 --> 00:52:29,517
Same with the Western people.

849
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:33,599
If you show that you have some business with them,

850
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,766
suddenly you know, they change.

851
00:52:37,142 --> 00:52:39,475
Suddenly they change. You can't understand

852
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:41,641
what has happened to this man.

853
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,683
Or, if they find out you are something in life, they change.

854
00:52:47,017 --> 00:52:50,100
Shri Krishna was just the other way round.

855
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:57,350
In His lifetime, He was always a guest of Vidhura

856
00:52:57,683 --> 00:53:05,058
who was the son of a Dhasi, is the servant.

857
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:09,267
Maidservant's son was Vidhura, but he was a realized soul.

858
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:12,808
So He used to go to his house,

859
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:16,766
stay in his house, a very humble abode, Vidhura's,

860
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:20,808
and eat food there, very simple food.

861
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:25,100
But He would not go to the palace of Duryodhana.

862
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,766
The other way round.

863
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,891
I mean, somebody thinks that you have a palace,

864
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:35,350
they'll be extremely kind to you, very nice, you know.

865
00:53:36,017 --> 00:53:39,142
But they say he lives in a hut, then he's nothing.

866
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:44,142
It's such a money orientation in subtle way.

867
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,517
Shri Krishna never, never cared for money

868
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,350
and never bothered about it.

869
00:53:52,225 --> 00:53:54,683
You can see His case

870
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:00,350
in which He has shown complete detachment

871
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:04,808
about His throne, or His kingdom,

872
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,267
or money part of it.

873
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:13,100
Once you are attached you have all the pangs of money.

874
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:15,891
Naturally, if you are catching hold of a snake

875
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:20,142
you'll always be having the pangs of the snake, don't you?

876
00:54:20,392 --> 00:54:22,683
But supposing you are detached.

877
00:54:23,517 --> 00:54:26,475
Then the same money you can use.

878
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:30,599
Once you become slave of that money,

879
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:33,392
that money sits on your head.

880
00:54:34,808 --> 00:54:38,599
Now, you know very well that to have money

881
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,017
also is dangerous these days.

882
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,017
The whole reaction is building up

883
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,559
and this is where the whole

884
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,766
all the elements are reacting against you.

885
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:56,017
You have seen the wisdom of these people from Sierra Nevada,

886
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,392
and what they said is true

887
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:07,683
that when we try to acquire more money,

888
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,017
go on acquiring, go on acquiring

889
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,933
and getting a idea in our head,

890
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:20,599
then there are looters who come round.

891
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:22,725
I think the worst are those

892
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:27,017
who have got names as entrepreneurs.

893
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:29,599
For example, they'll say, "Now,

894
00:55:29,808 --> 00:55:33,517
if you have a designer's watch",

895
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:41,017
then everybody ran for designer's watches.

896
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:48,142
The other day I went to Italy, no, to Istanbul

897
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:51,808
and I found out that the T-shirts are made there

898
00:55:52,142 --> 00:55:55,183
and sold in France as if they are French. They are not.

899
00:55:55,517 --> 00:56:02,267
They are A to Z, they are made in there, which is Istanbul

900
00:56:02,808 --> 00:56:05,517
and the name is on that Lacoste,

901
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:07,600
this that and all that.

902
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:10,683
And people pay any amount, but not in Turkey.

903
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:15,808
Whatever surplus is left we can get it for seven pounds.

904
00:56:17,142 --> 00:56:21,142
Now the stupidity is that they can befool you.

905
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:26,267
Pierre Cardin, then there's another one,

906
00:56:26,725 --> 00:56:30,517
I don't know, Armani - that's in Italy only,

907
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:33,058
but in America there are many.

908
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:36,058
Even, I mean, they come to you,

909
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,434
to your house.

910
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:39,183
England is much worse.

911
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,850
They're so unmannerly,

912
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:42,975
they'll come to your house for dinner

913
00:56:43,392 --> 00:56:46,975
and they'll turn the plate to see where it is made.

914
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:49,975
Really. Openly.

915
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:54,267
And they'll discuss from where the cutlery has come.

916
00:56:57,683 --> 00:57:01,183
So, though they think they're very rich,

917
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,058
stupidly they are being exploited by this kind of a nonsense

918
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:09,142
that you have this watch, you have this thing.

919
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:13,058
Now, in England we have something called Saville Row,

920
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,434
so that they put it outside, you know,

921
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:19,142
outside the coat - Saville Row.

922
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:21,183
Can you imagine?

923
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,058
Branded.

924
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:27,933
See, everything is made into a big ado.

925
00:57:28,392 --> 00:57:30,599
So on one side they are very intelligent

926
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:32,975
to understand this is the business,

927
00:57:32,975 --> 00:57:36,600
this is the fashion all that.

928
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:39,683
The other side they don't know they are fools,

929
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:42,392
being befooled all the time by saying

930
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,600
this is the special thing, that is the special thing

931
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:49,725
and that it has a name and it has, what you call,

932
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:54,267
the - a great organization behind it.

933
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,058
Sahaja Yogis should understand this is all befooling

934
00:58:00,517 --> 00:58:03,850
and stupid thing and they wear,

935
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:06,599
all of them will wear like that just to show off.

936
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,183
What is it?

937
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:12,933
Why should this impress anyone?

938
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:15,309
Think of it.

939
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:19,434
Now, intelligently think why should it impress you,

940
00:58:19,975 --> 00:58:22,517
these befooling things that are going on?

941
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:23,725
Nothing special.

942
00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:26,058
They are just the same.

943
00:58:26,392 --> 00:58:30,808
They told Me in Istanbul that they make ordinary ones

944
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:33,392
and then they put on top of this mark

945
00:58:33,683 --> 00:58:37,058
and the ordinary ones are for, say,

946
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:41,183
six dollars, so with this thing is for seven dollars.

947
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:45,599
There's nothing special,

948
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:50,725
but this special trickery, I think,

949
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:55,183
is coming from England and America especially

950
00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:00,309
maybe also from France, but France are, you know,

951
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:01,808
queer people.

952
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:05,392
Now they have something. I showed them today -

953
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:09,058
So stupidly made thing,

954
00:59:09,392 --> 00:59:12,517
which cost five hundred pounds,

955
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:16,850
but people accept because they have no wisdom.

956
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:21,933
Now see the difference between the intelligence and wisdom.

957
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:26,309
Why to show off, first of all

958
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,142
and to show off something which has no meaning?

959
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:36,142
It cost only one dollar in Turkey to put that thing on

960
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:39,183
and stupidly people are showing it.

961
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:48,725
Is it that we have intelligence,

962
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:52,058
but which has no divine power?

963
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:55,933
Anybody can befool you to do what you like.

964
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,309
Now six inches of skirt started.

965
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:00,142
All right, everywhere six inches.

966
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,267
You couldn't get one with the seven inches even.

967
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,600
That's not in the fashion.

968
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,808
That's not in - means 'in' in madhouse?

969
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:16,309
Now just look at Shri Krishna's style - so wise,

970
01:00:17,183 --> 01:00:18,933
witnessing everything,

971
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:21,309
how He plays around

972
01:00:23,017 --> 01:00:25,058
and how He wins over.

973
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:28,183
Now, supposing He was attached.

974
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:30,933
He could not have done it.

975
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:36,517
So to get over this, first of all, you detach yourself from this

976
01:00:36,808 --> 01:00:39,599
anti-Shri Krishna culture.

977
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,725
It's very important.

978
01:00:43,017 --> 01:00:45,434
This is the fashion. That is the fashion.

979
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:50,933
And all these fashions are extremely, extremely destructive.

980
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:53,933
Now, not to put oil in the hair

981
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:57,808
and end up with bald heads. All right.

982
01:00:58,142 --> 01:01:00,142
Then there are specialists, you see,

983
01:01:00,142 --> 01:01:04,183
again designers who make wigs, designer's wig.

984
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:07,725
So you carry a wig on your head and write it down, 'designer's.'

985
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:14,933
My idea is to see

986
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:20,850
how stupid human beings can become with their intellect.

987
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:27,599
Today I don't want to describe the qualities of Shri Krishna

988
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,725
because you know them.

989
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:33,725
But how you people have gone away,

990
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:39,683
in the West, from Shri Krishna's styles,

991
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:41,725
His methods.

992
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:45,309
Whatever He did was to destroy the evil,

993
01:01:46,017 --> 01:01:48,475
to destroy the negativity

994
01:01:48,808 --> 01:01:51,517
and to bring forth the joy,

995
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:56,599
which is Ras, He started. "Ras" - Ra is energy with that.

996
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:59,725
The Ras is the energy,

997
01:02:00,058 --> 01:02:03,599
which you have

998
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:07,309
and that's how you play the Ras,

999
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,517
with that energy and enjoy.

1000
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:11,183
He brought it Holi.

1001
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:13,142
Of course now "Holi" can be anything,

1002
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:19,017
but very sensible Holy he brought just to express your joy

1003
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:21,683
in mirthful, playful ways,

1004
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:25,725
because that was lacking in Shri Rama's life.

1005
01:02:25,725 --> 01:02:29,517
So He said just allow yourself to enjoy,

1006
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:33,850
but this was only for Sahaja Yogis.

1007
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:36,183
Not for others.

1008
01:02:36,183 --> 01:02:40,434
Others, you know that they go to the pubs

1009
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:43,267
and what happens. We have a certificate here that

1010
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:47,183
we are very peaceful, very good people, this and that.

1011
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:50,017
This is what Shri Krishna said

1012
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,017
and has done,

1013
01:02:52,475 --> 01:02:55,309
that we have to enjoy everything,

1014
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,017
but in a dharmic way.

1015
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:00,891
We should not be adharmic.

1016
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:04,225
The Dharma should give you Joy.

1017
01:03:04,475 --> 01:03:07,017
Otherwise, if you are dharmic, you know what happens,

1018
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:09,641
that you become absolutely austere,

1019
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:14,142
person, joyless person

1020
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:19,142
and sometimes cynical

1021
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:22,350
because you think others are adharmic and this and that.

1022
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:26,475
But Shri Krishna's ways were that you should be mirthful,

1023
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:28,142
you should be joyful

1024
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:31,475
and this joy will communicate with others.

1025
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:38,559
Without this joyous nature you cannot be communicator.

1026
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:41,350
But, as you know, when I went to French,

1027
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:43,434
they told Me, "Mother, you look so joyous,

1028
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:45,475
you should tell you are miserable."

1029
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:47,267
I said, "But I am not."

1030
01:03:47,267 --> 01:03:49,599
"If you don't tell, then they won't believe you."

1031
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:51,683
I said, "Why?" "Because they are all miserable

1032
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,100
and they think they are very unhappy people."

1033
01:03:55,891 --> 01:03:59,225
So I started my lecture with "Les Miserables"

1034
01:03:59,683 --> 01:04:04,225
and I told them that at every fourth lamppost

1035
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:08,975
you find a prostitute and every tenth one a pub.

1036
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:14,975
And I see so many people sitting on the pavement,

1037
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:17,434
so I asked them, "Why are they sitting here?"

1038
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:19,641
Said, "They are waiting the whole world to be destroyed."

1039
01:04:19,641 --> 01:04:23,559
I said, "Really?" After drinking, these ideas come in,

1040
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:25,392
that let the whole world be destroyed

1041
01:04:25,392 --> 01:04:28,475
because maybe they don't have any more money to go to pubs.

1042
01:04:28,475 --> 01:04:30,225
I don't know why.

1043
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:34,100
Now, think their level,

1044
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:36,766
just think of their level.

1045
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,100
Where are they

1046
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,100
compared to you all?

1047
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:48,559
So He's the one, as Virata,

1048
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:51,017
puts light into your brain.

1049
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:56,475
In that light you see what is stupid;

1050
01:04:56,808 --> 01:04:58,559
what is unwise.

1051
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:01,641
This is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

1052
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:08,350
And He gives you the nirananda

1053
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:12,559
because if you don't have the light you cannot enjoy

1054
01:05:14,017 --> 01:05:18,392
the joy of your mind

1055
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:20,933
or the joy of your brain.

1056
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:22,559
You cannot.

1057
01:05:23,475 --> 01:05:26,808
And it is through His light

1058
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:29,017
that we see

1059
01:05:31,017 --> 01:05:36,017
ourselves as something full of joy

1060
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:38,599
and we don't know what to do with it

1061
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:42,350
and how to do it;

1062
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,392
how to express our joy;

1063
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,225
how to express our feelings.

1064
01:05:47,225 --> 01:05:49,766
Because it's too much.

1065
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:53,392
This another fashion to say, "It's too much."

1066
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:57,142
Anything you tell them," Mother,it is too much."

1067
01:05:57,142 --> 01:06:00,183
Because the brain is full of nonsense,

1068
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:02,850
so you tell them anything, nothing can go in their heads.

1069
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,725
"It's too much."

1070
01:06:06,392 --> 01:06:09,058
So the wise person,

1071
01:06:09,725 --> 01:06:11,808
as Shri Krishna is,

1072
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,142
wisest of wise,

1073
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:16,725
He's the source of wisdom,

1074
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:19,850
has to be Stitha Pragya.

1075
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,599
Means he has to be in balance,

1076
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:26,183
he has to be in dharma

1077
01:06:29,725 --> 01:06:33,392
and, above that,

1078
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:36,600
he has to be in Joy.

1079
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,850
Now, you are not only in joy, but you know the truth.

1080
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:44,017
You know the absolute truth.

1081
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:48,434
And this absolute truth

1082
01:06:48,683 --> 01:06:53,267
is the one that makes you understand

1083
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:58,142
what is right, what is wrong and you develop your wisdom,

1084
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:00,933
not your intellect so much.

1085
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:04,434
You then see your intellect misbehaving sometimes,

1086
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:06,017
telling you negative ideas,

1087
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:08,309
sometimes too much of aggressive ideas.

1088
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:11,392
You can become a witness, "sakshi",

1089
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:12,975
and that's why Shri Krishna has said,

1090
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:15,850
"I am the sakshi of the whole world,

1091
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,183
the witness of the whole world."

1092
01:07:18,808 --> 01:07:21,309
See, you can go on talking about Him,

1093
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:25,641
but what we have to see, where are we going wrong

1094
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,434
and how can Shri Krishna save us?

1095
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:33,517
Not by singing, "Hari Rama, Hari Krishna", like that.

1096
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:40,850
By becoming, day by day, wiser person.

1097
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:49,559
Wisdom gives you definite ideas as to how you have to be.

1098
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:53,058
If there is still this thing going on.

1099
01:07:53,058 --> 01:07:56,350
See, in the Western way they show like this.

1100
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:57,683
Ask them, "How are you?"

1101
01:07:57,683 --> 01:07:59,891
"I'm like this." Means what?

1102
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:02,017
"Like this."

1103
01:08:02,017 --> 01:08:04,017
If that is still there,

1104
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:06,475
then Shri Krishna is not awakened,

1105
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:11,559
but if it is that you know what it is,

1106
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,683
you'll have the same smile as Shri Krishna had.

1107
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,808
I know. I know that.

1108
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:25,392
Now we have to understand that our Vishuddhi

1109
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,559
has to be all right.

1110
01:08:27,766 --> 01:08:30,559
I get Vishuddhi because I know what it is.

1111
01:08:30,559 --> 01:08:31,891
This is America, should be all right,

1112
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:35,142
otherwise My Vishuddhi will never be all right. I think so.

1113
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,267
But for Vishuddhi,

1114
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,933
there are so many things we have in Sahaja Yoga

1115
01:08:41,225 --> 01:08:43,142
which very few people do.

1116
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:45,933
At least if you Sahaja Yogis keep your Vishuddhi all right,

1117
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:48,267
I'll be much better off.

1118
01:08:48,683 --> 01:08:51,475
But you never try to keep your Vishuddhi all right.

1119
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:53,766
Continue with it. Continue with it.

1120
01:08:54,017 --> 01:08:55,475
Even the president of America

1121
01:08:55,683 --> 01:08:58,766
has the worst Vishuddhi I've ever seen,

1122
01:08:59,017 --> 01:09:01,599
so you can imagine what good is he going to do.

1123
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:06,100
What wisdom will he have?

1124
01:09:07,891 --> 01:09:10,683
Now you are a new race,

1125
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:14,766
blessed by the Divine,

1126
01:09:14,766 --> 01:09:18,225
and you have Shri Krishna within yourself awakened.

1127
01:09:18,808 --> 01:09:23,683
In His own glory, in His own light,

1128
01:09:24,599 --> 01:09:27,350
you should know what is to be done.

1129
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,933
One must communicate.

1130
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:32,683
That you have to do,

1131
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:36,267
but what I've seen that people don't even meditate.

1132
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:37,808
Even if they meditate,

1133
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,392
they don't want to communicate.

1134
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:41,475
And sometimes when they communicate,

1135
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:44,017
they think they have become Gods.

1136
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,641
It's very difficult.

1137
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:50,017
Human beings is very

1138
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,392
difficult commodity to handle.

1139
01:09:55,475 --> 01:09:58,808
You have to communicate with complete humility

1140
01:10:00,058 --> 01:10:02,350
the way Shri Krishna did.

1141
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:03,933
In His ras,

1142
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:07,225
He spread the energy of Radha

1143
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:11,225
into all these people by holding hands.

1144
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:15,350
So His childhood where He killed so many people

1145
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:17,891
and did all that is over.

1146
01:10:18,225 --> 01:10:20,808
Then even His adulthood,

1147
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,891
where He had to kill His own uncle, is also over.

1148
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:27,766
So He becomes the king.

1149
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:33,017
When He becomes the king then what does He do?

1150
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:35,142
Is to communicate.

1151
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,100
Most of His,

1152
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:41,142
expressions of His qualities

1153
01:10:41,142 --> 01:10:44,766
are seen after He became the king.

1154
01:10:45,017 --> 01:10:47,683
Before that He was busy killing,

1155
01:10:47,933 --> 01:10:50,475
one after another, all these horrible people.

1156
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:53,225
After that He built,

1157
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,142
built up people.

1158
01:10:55,142 --> 01:10:57,891
He built Dwarika and

1159
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,267
He tried to communicate

1160
01:11:03,808 --> 01:11:05,142
with people.

1161
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:08,142
Now your duty is to build up yourself

1162
01:11:08,142 --> 01:11:10,267
and to communicate with others

1163
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,766
with all the sweetness, madhurya of Shri Krishna,

1164
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,392
all the beauty of Shri Krishna,

1165
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:20,267
with full understanding

1166
01:11:20,517 --> 01:11:23,475
as to what stupid things are going round and around.

1167
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:27,017
Once you understand that,

1168
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:30,225
you'll not take it because you will become wise

1169
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:33,392
enough not to take to all these nonsensical things

1170
01:11:33,683 --> 01:11:35,100
that are going on.

1171
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,350
And it is so much,

1172
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,808
I mean, I, in this lecture, I cannot tell you,

1173
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,350
but now if you become the witness of the whole thing

1174
01:11:41,599 --> 01:11:43,350
you'll see what is happening.

1175
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:48,225
Now we have to stop them from going to Hell.

1176
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:55,766
And we have to really develop a very, very good personality

1177
01:11:55,766 --> 01:11:58,142
of a Sahaja Yogi. All of you.

1178
01:11:58,559 --> 01:12:01,225
Now, there are many marriages that take place,

1179
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:03,475
then suddenly they decide to divorce.

1180
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:05,392
Divorce is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,

1181
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:08,225
but this American style of nonsense

1182
01:12:08,475 --> 01:12:10,350
I don't want to have.

1183
01:12:11,683 --> 01:12:13,808
Women are can be very dominating.

1184
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:16,225
One fellow ran away to Russia.

1185
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,142
They have no idea of a marriage.

1186
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:21,641
They don't know how to work it out.

1187
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:24,392
All the sweetness of the marriage is finished.

1188
01:12:24,392 --> 01:12:25,683
If the husband is dominating,

1189
01:12:25,683 --> 01:12:27,142
the wife is dominating,

1190
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:28,933
this happens, then you divorce.

1191
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:31,641
What is the achievement?

1192
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,641
So we have to work out

1193
01:12:36,142 --> 01:12:38,766
everything within us because we are conditioned,

1194
01:12:38,766 --> 01:12:40,517
we are in an atmosphere.

1195
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:42,766
I would request all of you

1196
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:46,100
to try to understand these subtleties

1197
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,933
of Shri Krishna's personality.

1198
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,017
Try to become like that

1199
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:53,766
extremely peaceful,

1200
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:58,933
extremely kind, tender, helpful.

1201
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,683
And in humility,

1202
01:13:01,933 --> 01:13:04,100
He had no consciousness of money.

1203
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:06,350
Nothing.

1204
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,891
And also, as you know, He was a dark person

1205
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:14,559
for some reason,

1206
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,641
but the way He led his life

1207
01:13:19,017 --> 01:13:20,891
should be an example for us.

1208
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:27,475
I'm sure, now, when you go back to your countries

1209
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:29,350
you'll see all this nonsense.

1210
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,891
Please note it down.

1211
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:33,683
Write it down what these nonsensical people are doing

1212
01:13:33,683 --> 01:13:35,808
and send it over to Me.

1213
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:38,392
That's what it is.

1214
01:13:38,392 --> 01:13:41,683
So today is the puja of Shri Krishna.

1215
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,475
I need not tell you how many qualities He has, as I told you,

1216
01:13:45,933 --> 01:13:49,100
but the greatest quality He has that

1217
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:53,933
He is the doctor of doctors.

1218
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,142
Now, in His name you will know how many qualities He has

1219
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,808
and you will understand.

1220
01:14:03,808 --> 01:14:05,267
Try to understand that

1221
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:07,808
we have to have these qualities within us also.

1222
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:10,350
Whatever qualities are described or said,

1223
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,933
try to see how many we have.

1224
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:16,475
That's the way the introspection will start.

1225
01:14:16,475 --> 01:14:18,683
Once you start introspecting yourself

1226
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:20,683
and understanding yourself,

1227
01:14:20,683 --> 01:14:24,100
the wisdom will grow - not by seeing faults in others,

1228
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:27,599
putting blames on others, but on yourself.

1229
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:30,766
That is how the things will work out.

1230
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:33,100
Though Krishna didn't have to do that because

1231
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,475
He was Sampurna, He was complete.

1232
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,183
But we have to do all this

1233
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,975
to see that we also become complete.

1234
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,559
Thank you very much.

1235
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,641
May God bless you all.

1236
01:14:52,517 --> 01:14:54,350
May God bless you.

1237
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:01,891
There's another point I wanted to mention about Sahaja Yogis,

1238
01:15:02,559 --> 01:15:07,350
that we introduce classical Indian music for you people,

1239
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:11,975
because I think it helps for vibrations.

1240
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:15,350
But as the nature is of western people,

1241
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:20,183
anything they take up they must go to the utilmate end

1242
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:23,058
'til they are completely lost.

1243
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:30,183
So what I find now all of them are buying tapes.

1244
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:35,017
Some tapes ...

1245
01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:54,267
Now some of them are buying tapes, I was surprised,

1246
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:57,766
of very unknown people, just mad.

1247
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:02,434
Once I was traveling with a lady in America,

1248
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,683
was a disciple of Muktanand.

1249
01:16:05,142 --> 01:16:09,017
She said, "I have a very nice tape," and she played the,

1250
01:16:09,017 --> 01:16:10,599
the, lecture of Muktanand.

1251
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,766
Rajneesh's people will play the lecture of Rajneesh.

1252
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:18,350
But here now they've all gone to one side,

1253
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:19,975
so this one, that one,

1254
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,683
all kinds of music they have got.

1255
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:26,225
Tomorrow, we start

1256
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:30,599
telling you that you must understand Indian dancing,

1257
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:34,434
so all my videos will be replaced by Indian dancing

1258
01:16:34,434 --> 01:16:36,142
from A to Z.

1259
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:40,017
You are Sahaja Yogis.

1260
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:43,559
It's all right, I am also fond of music,

1261
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,350
but it's not the way.

1262
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:48,100
What is the main thing of your life?

1263
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:52,683
And I was surprised how people are lost in the music.

1264
01:16:54,599 --> 01:16:57,559
I mean there should be some occasion.

1265
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:02,599
They're all already in another world with the music.

1266
01:17:03,434 --> 01:17:04,766
Don't do these things.

1267
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:07,559
You go to extremes of everything.

1268
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,267
That's not proper, even pujas, anything,

1269
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:11,975
you go to extremes.

1270
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,599
To go to extremes, you won't be in the center.

1271
01:17:14,975 --> 01:17:19,475
You will not be in the place of Shri Krishna,

1272
01:17:19,766 --> 01:17:21,850
where you have to be.

1273
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:24,309
On the contrary, you will be

1274
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,975
just in another imaginary world.

1275
01:17:29,891 --> 01:17:35,559
So, as a matter of habit we create a world like that;

1276
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:37,100
somebody has music world;

1277
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,850
somebody has dancing world;

1278
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,683
another one has,

1279
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:47,017
world, I've seen with Sahaja Yogis who think

1280
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:49,225
no end of themselves.

1281
01:17:49,475 --> 01:17:51,891
"We have a special relationship with Shri Mataji."

1282
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:53,559
Is a very common thing.

1283
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:56,559
But I cannot have any special relationship.

1284
01:17:57,683 --> 01:17:58,766
Sorry,

1285
01:18:01,766 --> 01:18:05,434
nobody has any special relationship with Me.

1286
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:08,766
This I would like to tell you very clearly,

1287
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,309
and you should not claim that,

1288
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:14,017
and then become, some people say, "we are deities."

1289
01:18:14,017 --> 01:18:17,559
I mean this is something to be - horrible.

1290
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:22,641
I'll speak for two minutes in Marathi if you don't mind...

1291
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,766
Now I want to talk to the Maharashtrian girls.

1292
01:18:26,683 --> 01:18:28,517
You have been married here,

1293
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:30,600
and have got rich husbands.

1294
01:18:32,017 --> 01:18:33,058
But as soon as you came here

1295
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:36,559
you've started sending money to your parents.

1296
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,808
Does this happen in India?

1297
01:18:38,808 --> 01:18:41,183
Can you send money to your parents from your in laws' house.

1298
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,475
Secondly is ornaments.

1299
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,392
You've started making a lot of ornaments.

1300
01:18:46,808 --> 01:18:48,475
I asked a Sahaja yogi husband

1301
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:50,808
why don't you buy a shirt for yourself.

1302
01:18:50,808 --> 01:18:51,850
He said, "what should I do,

1303
01:18:52,183 --> 01:18:53,891
my wife is spending all the money on ornaments."

1304
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:59,766
This greed for ornaments does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

1305
01:19:04,517 --> 01:19:06,683
This is a very serious matter.

1306
01:19:07,058 --> 01:19:09,891
Recently I learnt that all the Indian ladies

1307
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:13,850
have made ornaments after marriage.

1308
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:18,142
Thus there is no money left with the husband.

1309
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:20,475
Those husbands who used to support Sahaja yoga before

1310
01:19:20,808 --> 01:19:21,975
are unable to do so after the marriage.

1311
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:24,933
They have no money left with them.

1312
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:26,142
What has happened to you.

1313
01:19:26,142 --> 01:19:28,725
you've come here from the land of saints.

1314
01:19:29,517 --> 01:19:36,225
Shivaji Maharaj had a great respect for Shri Saint Tukaram

1315
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:39,475
and he took some ornaments for his wife.

1316
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:43,766
His wife must be somebody like you,

1317
01:19:44,017 --> 01:19:46,891
as she immediately accepted the ornaments.

1318
01:19:46,891 --> 01:19:50,850
Why should one be so much fond of ornaments?

1319
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,017
Even being a Goddess I am not fond of ornaments,

1320
01:19:52,475 --> 01:19:54,683
then why should you be so fond of them?

1321
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:59,933
Since they compulsorily offer me that's why I accept.

1322
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:07,225
So he gave and she accepted the ornaments,

1323
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:08,850
Saint Tukaram came and said,

1324
01:20:09,891 --> 01:20:12,725
"What is the need to have the ornaments for saints like us?"

1325
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:17,350
So he returned back all the ornaments.

1326
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:21,142
Know that you've come here from land of saints

1327
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,267
and this attitude of yours is a sign of poorness.

1328
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:27,100
You've been sending money to your parents

1329
01:20:27,475 --> 01:20:32,766
and I cannot explain to you how far this has gone.

1330
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:43,891
You've not come here to misbehave like this.

1331
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:46,058
You've come here to help Sahaja Yoga

1332
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:51,933
and not for making ornaments.

1333
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:54,142
If you do them once in a while it's all right

1334
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:59,850
but if you put all the attention on ornaments

1335
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:03,183
you might lose your husband and he might leave Sahaja Yoga.

1336
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:06,475
This would be good deed (meant not good), you will achieve!!

1337
01:21:08,142 --> 01:21:09,100
Without My permission henceforth,

1338
01:21:09,392 --> 01:21:11,559
nobody should make any ornaments.

1339
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,933
We'll have the Pooja now.
