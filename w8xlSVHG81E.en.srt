1
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:47,814
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
the Diwali, that is dipavali, meaning the

2
00:05:47,814 --> 00:06:02,744
rows of lights.

3
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:24,863
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find
from every place confusion of the worst type

4
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:34,444
creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate
into, and which looks like a solid mountain

5
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:44,594
around us, and which can never be covered,
as we feel, by the grace of God.

6
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:52,074
And even with the grace of God it would never
melt.

7
00:06:52,074 --> 00:07:09,114
In that darkness, in that hopeless state,
when the creation is on the verge of its destruction,

8
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:12,474
the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.

9
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:23,694
And you are the lights, you are the dipas,
you are the little, little lights, which were

10
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:34,484
waiting to be enlightened, to be enlightened
to see for yourself what’s wrong within

11
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:41,274
your own lamp, what’s missing in your own
lamp.

12
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:46,964
Now, in the lamp you have three things, as
you see.

13
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,435
One is the container.

14
00:07:48,435 --> 00:08:02,324
Container is this body, container is this
mind and the container is this intellect.

15
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:09,094
And the container contains within us itself,
is the oil.

16
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:16,054
In Sanskrit language it’s called snekda
or sneha, means the love.

17
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:25,514
Is the love that is within your mind, within
your body, within your existence itself.

18
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:33,454
But this love is now limited, it is in a dormant
state.

19
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:43,054
It doesn’t express itself, it can spill
out in wrong directions, it may spoil some

20
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,364
things, which are beautiful.

21
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:50,894
This love, when it is limited, is very dangerous.

22
00:08:50,894 --> 00:09:00,534
But when there is a third thing within you,
which we call as the bhati, is the wick.

23
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:09,164
And this wick is the pure desire within you,
which is not yet lightened – it is not aware

24
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:10,724
of itself.

25
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:18,564
Nobody is aware, the lamp is not aware that
there is a light within itself.

26
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:26,484
All these three things have to combine to
give that light because we are lost in so

27
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:27,814
many things.

28
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:33,854
This darkness of Kali Yuga is not one-sided.

29
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:46,004
If you see it clearly it is not only materialism,
adherence to money, adherence to money-power,

30
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,543
it’s not only that.

31
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,934
That’s, of course, is very important these
days, we cannot neglect it, because that’s

32
00:09:53,934 --> 00:10:04,244
something is really weighing this whole balance
of the Western world.

33
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:08,814
But this money is for power.

34
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:11,754
Why money?

35
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:15,234
Because it has a power, according to many
people who are blind.

36
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:25,214
They think money has the power to win-over
people, to exist in higher powers of, say,

37
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:32,154
execution of their administration and all
that you need money.

38
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,154
To win our votes, to get elected.

39
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:39,614
That’s the myth people are carrying all
the time, that money is very important, and

40
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,974
without money you can’t manage things.

41
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:50,234
And also because of this kind of a misunderstanding
about money people get very much impressed

42
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:57,314
by the people who have money, and they think,
“Now, this is the time we must really gather

43
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:59,274
money somehow or other.”

44
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:04,414
Try to get money out of every kind of a adharma.

45
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,304
“What’s wrong?”

46
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:12,994
So this money orientation has gone in this
Kali Yuga to such a limit, that the sense

47
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:18,374
of chastity is lost, the sense of creativity
is lost – because you must create something

48
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,004
that must sell.

49
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:22,554
If it cannot sell then you should not.

50
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:27,344
Then, the sense of Dharma is lost, there is
no Dharma.

51
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,193
When it comes to making money, what is the
Dharma?

52
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,334
There is no Dharma needed.

53
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:35,484
Only Dharma is how to make money.

54
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:39,114
Then, of course, the love.

55
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:44,334
The mothers don’t want children because
they have to spend money on their children.

56
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:50,114
It is the conceive, a selfishness that starts
working.

57
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:55,344
And people start thinking about, “How we
can grab money from others?”

58
00:11:55,344 --> 00:12:00,444
There are many sophisticated ways of grabbing
money also in the modern times.

59
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:06,244
And the sophistication has reached such subtleties
that a person doesn’t know until he is completely

60
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,824
robbed.

61
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:18,884
Now, there are other ways of getting money,
is now that the kind of a music nowadays people

62
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:24,814
are having – which is against God – it
doesn’t sing the praise of God, but it’s

63
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:27,454
just a noise that they make.

64
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:30,054
If you sing the praise of God it’s different.

65
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:35,504
But otherwise this kind of music that they
have, actually works on your limbic area.

66
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:42,084
And the limbic area has the capacity to give
you joy and happiness, and this limbic area

67
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:49,254
becomes numb because of this music, of this
horrible music of modern times.

68
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:57,104
When it becomes numb then what you do is to
have more noise and more noise and more noise,

69
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:44,044
to give a sensation to the limbic area.

70
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:51,094
So the limbic area when it becomes sensation-less
they don’t know how to give it a sensation,

71
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:57,184
so they take to drugs, you have to take to
drugs, you can’t help it, because all the

72
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,354
sensation is lost.

73
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:04,983
So, in the name of also anti-culture, or you
can call an anti-tradition, anti-this and

74
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:14,183
anti-that, what you develop is a limbic area
which requires sensations.

75
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:20,754
Now the music fetches money, because it’s
like drug, it’s like any alcohol, it’s

76
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,403
any intoxication.

77
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:28,913
Because already the nerves are intoxicated.

78
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:39,024
Even alcohol works the same way, even other
things like drugs also work the same way.

79
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:44,624
So, in that intoxication you really do not
know what are you up to.

80
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:52,553
A kind of another darkness, another blindness
comes over.

81
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:59,644
So in this darkness – this another additional
darkness makes people much more blind, much

82
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:03,053
more understanding.

83
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:11,564
This then takes us to the problem of the body
that exists, of the mind that exists, of the

84
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:14,104
intellect that exists.

85
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:22,793
When the whole thing is directed towards money-orientation
we put our body for sale.

86
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:33,423
We want to make our body look like nothing
on earth, I could say, like some sort of a

87
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:39,684
tuberculosis patient as they say (Laughter),
or mosquitoes.

88
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:45,733
Because that makes people have some pity I
think, but inside exists a terribly, a shrew

89
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:49,963
type of a temperament in a man or a woman.

90
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:55,963
The whole thing is done by entrepreneurs,
if you see that because they want to produce

91
00:15:55,963 --> 00:16:00,583
things and they want to create images by which
you have to live.

92
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:07,463
And if you have to live with those images
you have to take to the kind of things they

93
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:13,913
are producing and that’s how you try to
use those things and you become just a slave

94
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:14,983
to those entrepreneurs.

95
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:23,314
It has gone too far – it has gone too far
into the production of things where you have

96
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:33,233
to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

97
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:41,783
We have so many diseases in our country and
these diseases are very modern, meant only

98
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,113
for modern men.

99
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:48,744
In the older days people didn’t know these
diseases – must be having one or two, but

100
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:51,103
not many.

101
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:58,283
So these diseases also come out of the fact
that most of the things we eat or most of

102
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:07,434
the things we do are just the games of the
entrepreneurs.

103
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:13,783
Nothing fresh, nothing genuine, nothing sensible
is produced.

104
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:24,353
Wants are created that you must have at least
ten dresses, all made of pure plastic (Laughter)

105
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:33,113
– which reacts, which reacts and which creates
problems.

106
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:45,403
Then you should have all kinds of other materials,
which are absolutely harmless and are anti-human

107
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:46,923
beings.

108
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:51,994
All machinery is for us, we are not for machinery.

109
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,004
So we have to give a balance.

110
00:17:54,004 --> 00:18:00,843
Whatever we need can be done through the machinery,
but when machinery becomes the only source

111
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:04,023
of exploitation it starts dominating us.

112
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:13,684
See, if you go to the darkness of this Kali
Yuga – it’s so deep, it’s so horrid

113
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:19,593
and it’s so dangerous and destructive that
the description of it can take you to any

114
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:28,303
land and you will not even feel that you are
getting into the mire deep, deep, deep into

115
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:35,583
it, that you cannot come out of it.

116
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:47,214
So the antidote has come now as Sahaja Yoga
– the Diwali, the dipavali of the Sahaja

117
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,293
Yogis.

118
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:53,603
See now, after Realization you don’t need
beauty-treatment much.

119
00:18:53,603 --> 00:19:01,814
You don’t need so many plastic clothes (Laughter).

120
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:10,833
You don’t indulge into all kinds of stupid
activities which are joyless.

121
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,913
You don’t take to drugs.

122
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:14,783
You don’t take to smoking.

123
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:22,504
You don’t take to alcohols and you don’t
take to this horrid music also.

124
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:31,574
On the contrary you take to the music that
pacifies, which sooths your limbic area, which

125
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:33,843
gives joy.

126
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:41,644
So you indulge into all the pursuits which
will give you joy, start giving up gradually.

127
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:46,394
Sometimes I have to tell you but then you
understand and you give up all those things

128
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:51,634
because then you have tasted the joy, you
know what this joy is, you know the ambrosia

129
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:53,113
of joy, so you don’t want to give it up.

130
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:57,814
You may, little bit, give it up, then again
you come back.

131
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,963
You know this is joy.

132
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:04,913
Joy doesn’t lie in money, doesn’t lie
in all these joyless pursuits, nothing, but

133
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:11,033
joy lies in your Spirit, and the Spirit is
the one that enjoys the joy.

134
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:22,053
So, this Spirit is the one, which you see
burning at the end of your Kundalini – on

135
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,853
top of your Sahasrara.

136
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:29,703
And you have seen the photograph, on top of
your Sahasrara you see the beautiful flame

137
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,603
burning.

138
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:32,994
You have seen that photograph.

139
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:40,134
It’s the proof that now you are all the
lights, and that you have to give lights to

140
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:41,824
others.

141
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,523
You have to help people.

142
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:48,853
Now, all your faces look like roses, anybody
can see you and can make out that you are

143
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,333
something special people.

144
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:56,903
You are not like ordinary people who look
so miserable, horrible – and when you sing

145
00:20:56,903 --> 00:21:04,014
in that style also, you are singing God’s
sake, in every style, whatever you sing, which

146
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:10,763
was once upon a time was regarded as anti-God
singing becomes something great.

147
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:19,353
So now the light of Sahaja Yoga has kindled
within you all these small, small lights,

148
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:25,374
which are going to enlighten the path for
humanity, for their emancipation.

149
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:29,564
So responsibility of Sahaja Yogis are great.

150
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:35,573
They should get over all these limitations,
like the light has got over all the limitations

151
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:37,713
and spread all over.

152
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:45,324
If you have a way of measuring how far this
little light has gone you cannot measure it

153
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,363
with ordinary human instruments.

154
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:55,103
But once it starts it is spread to the last
bit of it and comes back to it.

155
00:21:55,103 --> 00:22:06,084
In the same way this light which is kindled
within you spreads all over, is emitted all

156
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:09,353
over and comes back to you.

157
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:14,633
But of course it is just a material light.

158
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,093
This is a spiritual light.

159
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:23,343
The difference is this light has its own power
of burning, that’s all.

160
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:29,133
Also it has a power of giving some light in
the darkness.

161
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:36,404
Also it has one more thing, that it can enlighten
another light.

162
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:45,244
But a Sahaja Yogi is not only the light himself,
but also the one who can go to others.

163
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:46,613
It cannot walk.

164
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:51,784
When it walks it is fire.

165
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,404
It cannot walk in it’s own limitations.

166
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:56,363
Somebody has to carry it.

167
00:22:56,363 --> 00:23:03,384
So the Sahaja Yogis are the ones who can carry
this light within themselves – very well

168
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:09,534
preserved and very beautifully enlighten another
person.

169
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:13,594
Without creating a fire, without burning anything.

170
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:18,494
You move this from here to there one has to
think thrice if you can move because you may

171
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:22,064
spill something or you may burn something.

172
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,714
But not a Sahaja Yogi.

173
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:28,724
And it is for the redemption.

174
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:33,854
This can give you light, which is outside,
by which you can see only – but you cannot

175
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:39,793
feel and you cannot cure.

176
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:50,114
You cannot give counsel, nor can you comfort
and you cannot redeem with this material.

177
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:53,344
It is spiritual light that is within us.

178
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,803
So today is a celebration of real Diwali.

179
00:23:55,803 --> 00:24:07,184
I always say that in India we were producing
the Diwali-lights with ordinary mud, but now,

180
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:15,034
in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are
giving light, the fragrance.

181
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:20,934
Such beautiful things they are and the way
you are enjoying it and expressing your joy

182
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:23,994
is so very beautiful.

183
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:33,823
But to be the lotus you have to give up this
mud, this darkness – you have to give up

184
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:34,823
that.

185
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:45,354
If you can’t give up that, then you cannot
enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.

186
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:47,904
So that giving-up is not difficult.

187
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:52,084
You see, when people say that, “You have
to love your Mother”, just means that you

188
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:56,534
give up your ego and your conditionings and
become a pure personality, that’s all.

189
00:24:56,534 --> 00:25:01,543
I mean, in any case all of you love Me but
still under limitations.

190
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:08,354
You must love Me without limitations, then
it is a real love as I love you.

191
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:12,024
For this we have to thank this time.

192
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,303
This time is great.

193
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:18,073
As I call it the blossom time, that at this
time you were all born and at this time I

194
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:23,984
came and at this time this combination took
place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established.

195
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:28,654
You don’t know, I have gone through very
great difficulties in the beginning.

196
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,124
Very great difficulties.

197
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:34,364
Because Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood by
idiots.

198
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:40,264
And first I met only idiots in My life (Laughter),
quite a lot of idiots.

199
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:43,344
As Christ has said, “The first will be the
last”, you see.

200
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:47,673
Perhaps those idiots that I’ve met have
created lots of problems for Me.

201
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,124
But then real people started coming to Me.

202
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:56,634
They understood Sahaja Yoga, they took to
Sahaja Yog’ and it worked out very well.

203
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:59,823
Now we have plans to go to India.

204
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:07,774
The speciality of Indian Tour is that India,
as you know, is a place of quite lot of work

205
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,994
done by the great saints, especially Maharashtra.

206
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:18,744
Apart from that it’s a very, very Holy Land,
no doubt about it, it’s very clean.

207
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:23,114
Still the people have not taken to materialism
to that extent.

208
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:28,694
And thirdly we have about eight pujas in such
a short time.

209
00:26:28,694 --> 00:26:30,974
Of course, it is too much for Me, sometimes.

210
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:36,804
But we have eight pujas, and this is something
so intensive, one can do it.

211
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:42,823
This I can’t do anywhere else, as I can
do in India, because only in India the atmosphere,

212
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:46,964
the vibrations are sucked in, much faster
they are sucked than anywhere.

213
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:52,663
Because the darkness is not so much there,
and the light spreads much faster, much more

214
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:56,794
easily, and I can find it easier to work it
out.

215
00:26:56,794 --> 00:27:01,914
I’m sure those days will come everywhere,
when you put up your lights and you start

216
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,094
working it out.

217
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:11,104
I must congratulate all of you that you are
the ones, who are stuck-on to this darkness

218
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:17,754
and have created such a light with such responsibility,
with such understanding, with all the struggles

219
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:24,823
you had to go through, getting out of your
very limited basic problems.

220
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:30,724
It is remarkable the way you people have established
it, it’s unbelievable, because, you see,

221
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:36,994
you could have just said that, “This is
some philosophy, we don’t believe it.

222
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:40,443
This is something that we don’t understand.”

223
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:44,734
But it’s so congenial to you, because you
have become the Spirit.

224
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:49,214
Christ has said the same thing, but how many
have understood Christ?

225
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:53,434
Nobody has understood Christ, I think, till
it came through Christianity.

226
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:57,264
When it came through Sahaja Yoga you have
understood who He was.

227
00:27:57,264 --> 00:28:05,314
In the same way for all other great prophets,
all other great Incarnations, you had to come

228
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:10,644
to Sahaja Yoga, to see in that light how great
they were, how much work they have done for

229
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:14,994
us, how much they have established us, how
much we should be thankful to you.

230
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:20,303
I hope one day you can see all of them sitting
with us and you can locate them, wherever

231
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:21,443
they are.

232
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:27,524
Those eyes you should develop one day, to
see all that, which your camera can see, sometimes.

233
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:30,745
And in the same way you should be able to
see, it will be a very good idea.

234
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:36,134
I think in Bogotha some of the Sahaja Yogis
did see the grace falling down, that’s all,

235
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,134
once.

236
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,904
But it will happen more and more.

237
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:46,734
Please try to improve your eye, in the sense
that, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes’.

238
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:50,674
Have no greed in your eye, for anything!

239
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:56,474
Try to remove the greed from your eye and
it will definitely start working out.

240
00:28:56,474 --> 00:29:04,423
So this is the message for our eyes because
through the eyes you are the light.

241
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:11,014
First thing that I have kindled is the light
in your eyes, and that’s what is the light

242
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:18,904
is to be improved, to be purified with love
– with the Divine Love.

243
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:20,323
May God bless you all!
