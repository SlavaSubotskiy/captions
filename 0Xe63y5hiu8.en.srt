1
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,160
Today we are going to celebrate the

2
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,190
birthday of Mahavira.

3
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,060
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

4
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,020
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

5
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,990
Now these two saints as you know

6
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,060
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

7
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,050
and another is Saint Michael.

8
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,190
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

9
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,030
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

10
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,180
So,

11
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,100
Mahavira

12
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,010
had to go through

13
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,060
lots of search.

14
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,180
Of course He was a

15
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,020
angel, but came as human being

16
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,040
and He had to find out

17
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,140
the thing of the left side,

18
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,000
and how the left side acts.

19
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,110
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

20
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,060
is much more complicated than right side.

21
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,020
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

22
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:14,010
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

23
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,030
They are described in books and given different names to them.

24
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,120
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

25
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,200
as you know, they cater to our past.

26
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,140
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

27
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,090
Every present becomes a past.

28
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,000
Then we have past of this lifetime,

29
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,190
and also we have past of our previous lives.

30
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,190
Then all the past is built in within us

31
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,010
since our creation.

32
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,020
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

33
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,040
are only triggered by

34
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,970
the entities that appear

35
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,980
from the left side.

36
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,130
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

37
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,970
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

38
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,190
specially Mooladhara,

39
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,030
or any left side, left Nabhi,

40
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,990
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

41
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,030
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

42
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,100
and the right side PingalaNadi

43
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,040
is connected with Swadisthana.

44
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,020
So the problems of Mooladhara

45
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,000
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

46
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,170
and when it is attacked,

47
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

48
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,170
then psychosomatic diseases

49
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,030
occur into human beings.

50
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,210
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

51
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,080
this is the another center, left and right,

52
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,140
they are on top of each other.

53
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,190
And using the right side too much,

54
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,010
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

55
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,040
on the left, triggers.

56
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,160
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

57
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,050
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

58
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,210
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

59
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,030
very right-sided,

60
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,050
suddenly something happens,

61
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,040
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

62
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,990
because of the past, and it triggers

63
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,030
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

64
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,200
Now this psychosomatic problem

65
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,030
is only cured if you know

66
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,210
what's the problem of the left side is.

67
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,050
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

68
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,040
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

69
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,980
when you start moving on the left side

70
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,040
the movement becomes linear of course,

71
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,190
but it moves downward,

72
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,190
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

73
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,980
So the movement goes down like that,

74
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,980
and then it coils up,

75
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,980
forms coils,

76
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,000
and you go on moving with it

77
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,010
so you are lost in the coil.

78
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,980
But the other one moves upward

79
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
and the coils are not so many,

80
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,110
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

81
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,030
So those people who go to the left,

82
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,030
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

83
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,090
crying about themselves and always complaining,

84
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,180
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

85
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,000
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

86
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,020
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

87
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,200
That's how this left side

88
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,990
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

89
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,050
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

90
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,980
So He has mentioned practically, in details,

91
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,020
lots of things that can happen to a person

92
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,020
who goes to the left side.

93
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,100
He gave the idea of hell.

94
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,030
He also described seven types of hell.

95
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,080
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

96
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
what is hell is,

97
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,090
horrifyingly cruel,

98
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,200
horrifyingly joyless

99
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,070
and horrifyingly

100
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,190
so repulsive that

101
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,160
you hate yourself when you understand

102
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,210
you have committed this mistake,

103
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,190
you have committed this pap,  this

104
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,070
sin;

105
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,140
and then what is the result,

106
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,050
what you get - the punishment part.

107
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,150
Mahavira worked it out everything,

108
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,180
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

109
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,040
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

110
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:41,110
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

111
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,150
but not to that extent

112
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,020
because He had to deal with the combination,

113
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,070
but mostly with the left side.

114
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,980
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

115
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,030
that there is a soul that is

116
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,150
made out of the causal bodies

117
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,050
of all the five elements.

118
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,190
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

119
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,180
So this

120
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,090
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

121
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,010
and your centers,

122
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,090
plus we can say, also

123
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,050
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

124
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,160
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

125
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,130
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

126
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,030
So it has a connection with every center.

127
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,170
Now this is the soul when we die,

128
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:10,110
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

129
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,090
and it is the soul that guides now

130
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,160
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

131
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,030
into a new being and that's how it works out.

132
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,150
So everything that we have done so far

133
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,170
is recorded in that soul.

134
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,070
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

135
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,200
round, round things, you see, lying together.

136
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,090
What is that?"

137
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,110
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

138
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,190
And now they have found out what I have told them.

139
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,070
Because, you see, when a person dies

140
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,150
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

141
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,150
round, round things:

142
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,120
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

143
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,050
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

144
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:18,130
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

145
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,130
which is the reflector of every cell.

146
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,140
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

147
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:35,160
which is placed on one side of the cell

148
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,080
also has this soul reflected,

149
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,080
and the main soul which is on the back

150
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,210
controls that

151
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,030
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

152
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,030
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

153
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,080
this kind of seven loops,

154
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,970
seven loops because it sits on the eight –

155
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,010
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

156
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,120
Now what He found out that,

157
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,150
when people die

158
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,190
then some of the souls

159
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:36,010
are born again just after few days,

160
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,010
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

161
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,060
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

162
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,190
So they are - the people who have died -

163
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,040
they are of a category, one category,

164
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:59,170
where they exist for a very short time

165
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,210
in the collective subconscious

166
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,190
and then they take their rebirth.

167
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,030
They are very ordinary people,

168
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,190
aimless, useless people.

169
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,140
But there are some souls when they die,

170
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,210
they just hang in the air

171
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,190
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

172
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,150
who will fulfill their desires

173
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,080
which are not yet fulfilled.

174
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,180
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

175
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,980
can join another human being who's living,

176
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,180
who would like to drink.

177
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,980
So once he starts getting this...

178
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,130
So once it starts

179
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,160
getting into the habit of drinking,

180
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,970
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

181
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,140
and when they jump on that person

182
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,160
they can make him a real drunkard.

183
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,030
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

184
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,090
came from Cuba,

185
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,200
in America when I went first,

186
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,140
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

187
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,030
And her husband told Me that she can take

188
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,040
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

189
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,030
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

190
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:14,020
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

191
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,200
standing behind her.

192
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,010
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

193
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,040
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

194
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,160
"Mother, You see that one?

195
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,980
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

196
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,190
Of course I cured her

197
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,050
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

198
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,000
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

199
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,070
you lose complete control of yourself

200
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,120
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

201
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,120
And when it controls you,

202
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,000
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

203
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,990
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

204
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,040
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

205
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,050
that these spirits, these dead spirits

206
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,130
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

207
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,030
That's how it works.

208
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,110
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

209
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,080
nor did He find out all these things,

210
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,010
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

211
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,020
But what He has talked about is the hell.

212
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,020
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

213
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,160
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

214
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,990
and He has described the hell in a very,

215
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,980
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

216
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,130
And it's really horrible to know

217
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,140
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

218
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,190
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

219
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,150
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

220
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,970
But as incarnations take birth,

221
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,000
also these devils, some of them

222
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,130
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

223
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,130
also take their birth.

224
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,010
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

225
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,130
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

226
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,030
and things. And everything is happening now,

227
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,010
you find it how these people are taking their birth

228
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,080
and how they are misleading us.

229
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,030
How they are using the left Swadisthana

230
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,150
or we can call it the left side

231
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,200
just to immobilize us completely.

232
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,050
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

233
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,010
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

234
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,030
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

235
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,980
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

236
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,010
is to take the name of Mahavira,

237
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,150
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

238
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,140
and comes and stays here onto the -

239
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,090
we can say the point which is for our superego.

240
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,150
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

241
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,990
and does all that is required

242
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,200
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,050
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

244
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,030
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

245
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,200
because these people don't mind even

246
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,000
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

247
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,070
or sitting with everything and meditating.

248
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,150
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

249
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,060
absolutely dirty.

250
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,150
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

251
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,030
and with that they actually create a problem

252
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,110
between themselves and the God.

253
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,140
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

254
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,210
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

255
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,030
so the Goddess will disappear;

256
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,130
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

257
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,980
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

258
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,110
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

259
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,210
trying to come back

260
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:25,170
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

261
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,190
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

262
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,000
who know how to catch hold of these people

263
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,120
and put them on somebody,

264
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,110
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

265
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,150
So it's a continuous process,

266
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,040
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

267
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,180
Now when we know all this,

268
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,980
still we get caught up on the left side.

269
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,080
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

270
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,010
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

271
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,020
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

272
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,150
Now why was He called Mahavira?

273
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,990
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

274
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,070
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

275
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,210
So only He could enter into the being fully

276
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,210
and could kill or you can say destroy

277
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,110
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

278
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,110
all these negative things that come to us.

279
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,040
Now as you know we use left side very much

280
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

281
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,080
but if there is no help,

282
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,110
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

283
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,040
We  call the name of Mahavira -

284
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,040
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

285
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,180
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

286
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,020
All this works out because of Him

287
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,070
and He is such a great identity.

288
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,050
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

289
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,000
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

290
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,210
Moreover, you see, the

291
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,110
whole concept

292
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,060
of hell and all that is described

293
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,110
 in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

294
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,020
And if you try to go in there, you see,

295
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,010
when I try to go there and to find out,

296
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,030
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

297
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,120
 all the things that are happening about a person,

298
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,000
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

299
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,030
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

300
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,140
You have to take to the subconscious

301
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,080
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

302
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,000
to see what's happening in the left side.

303
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,990
It's a very funny situation, I think,

304
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,070
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

305
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,150
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

306
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,160
with the help of Mahavira.

307
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,030
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

308
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,190
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

309
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,160
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

310
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,000
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

311
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,000
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

312
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,210
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

313
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,970
Because they are possessed.

314
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,070
Now even the viruses and all these things

315
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,180
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

316
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,210
all, I would say the incurable diseases

317
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,160
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

318
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,070
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

319
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,030
which are not curable.

320
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,990
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

321
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,160
who has given us this power

322
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,090
to remove our left-sided problems,

323
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:07,050
who has given us this light in our hand,

324
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,170
which He Himself vibrates

325
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,010
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

326
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,210
on the obscure things - about Me also.

327
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,170
Because of Him only

328
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,000
we can get cured

329
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,180
of so many physical and mental troubles.

330
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,210
You know that the left side can be easily cured

331
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,210
if you use three-candle treatment.

332
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,160
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

333
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,070
He doesn't like darkness.

334
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,060
And His idea is, I think that way,

335
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,180
is to now fully go all the way

336
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
to clear the left side as far as possible,

337
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,970
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

338
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:09,020
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

339
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,970
lot of it.

340
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,030
So He is working it out, everywhere,

341
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,110
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

342
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,210
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

343
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,170
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

344
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,030
So we have to be very thankful to Him

345
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,000
that He has achieved this kind of entry

346
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,170
into the left side and has found out for us

347
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,090
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

348
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,000
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

349
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,050
to celebrate His birthday here

350
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,010
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

351
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,160
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

352
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,140
as a person who is naked.

353
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,010
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

354
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,200
and to find out about the left side

355
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,050
and when He got up, you see,

356
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,070
He got caught up in one of the bushes

357
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:19,990
and He had to torn off half part of that.

358
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,190
When that half part was torn off,

359
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,050
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

360
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,110
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

361
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,210
as a little boy from a village

362
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,040
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

363
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,990
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

364
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,120
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

365
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,990
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

366
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:59,180
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

367
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,180
and who ran away.

368
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,170
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

369
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,110
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

370
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,040
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

371
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,050
because He was a king you see,

372
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,100
and He hid Himself with leaves

373
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,020
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

374
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,980
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

375
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,210
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

376
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,100
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

377
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,150
against all the worms, everything.

378
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,020
It's said, these people have started,

379
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,070
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

380
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,060
like you can a, even serpent

381
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,000
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

382
00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:01,040
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

383
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,150
Now these Jains are mad.

384
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,000
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

385
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,150
that they try to save even the bugs,

386
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,110
put the bugs in a hut,

387
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,010
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

388
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,160
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

389
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,120
and once the brahmin is

390
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,090
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

391
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,180
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

392
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

393
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,050
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

394
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,100
they give him money as a reward

395
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,120
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

396
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,170
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

397
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:47,040
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

398
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,050
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

399
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,030
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

400
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,060
are not at all required,

401
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,050
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

402
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:05,070
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

403
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,080
what they should eat.

404
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,150
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

405
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,000
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

406
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,210
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

407
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,100
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

408
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,990
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

409
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,970
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

410
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,170
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

411
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,200
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

412
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,020
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

413
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,120
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

414
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,120
and they want to be vegetarians.

415
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,970
Finished. How will they fight it?

416
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,010
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

417
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:03,060
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

418
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,100
we can say like that, you see, a person

419
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,970
who tries to remove the -

420
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,090
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

421
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,990
these lower animals live,

422
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,120
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

423
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,040
This is the stupid thing they do.

424
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,200
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

425
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,060
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

426
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,030
We require human beings.

427
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:49,190
So all this has happened because of human beings

428
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,970
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

429
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,090
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

430
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,160
and I've yet to come across a Christian

431
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,970
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

432
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,000
whether it's a woman or a man.

433
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,070
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

434
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,000
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

435
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,000
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

436
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,980
by these people who are trying

437
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,070
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

438
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,020
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

439
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,990
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

440
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,040
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

441
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,180
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

442
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,200
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

443
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,150
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

444
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,980
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

445
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,200
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

446
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
With that frustration what did he do?

447
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,040
He said, "I will not eat meat."

448
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,980
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

449
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,170
And that's how it's still going on,

450
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,200
 and these Jainies I find are the joyless people,

451
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,170
absolutely joyless.

452
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,110
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

453
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,100
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

454
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,110
that you can't understand, I mean they are

455
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,160
human beings but the way they behave you can't

456
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,070
understand them, they're not normal people.

457
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,130
So we realize

458
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,110
that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

459
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:52,030
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

460
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,190
they are Jains, and they are like this.

461
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,990
So what we have to do now is to understand

462
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,100
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

463
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,010
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

464
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,200
you know the modus operandi,

465
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,970
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

466
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,170
You know the whole subject

467
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,130
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

468
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,020
to succumb to any such arguments

469
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,190
or any such big, big talks or big, big

470
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,020
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

471
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,980
It's very important.

472
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,100
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

473
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,120
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

474
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,030
maybe Australians also,

475
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,110
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

476
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,000
So they can take to carbohydrates,

477
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,210
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

478
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,210
I mean, to compensate.

479
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,060
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

480
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,150
as will do, do them good.

481
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,990
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

482
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,170
But a balance has to be found out,

483
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,110
and once you strike it

484
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,020
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

485
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,170
so much enlightened

486
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,110
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

487
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,030
So for food, you have to be careful.

488
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,200
Same about with clothes

489
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,180
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

490
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,160
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

491
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,150
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

492
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,210
Now for example, in a climate like this

493
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,120
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

494
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,990
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

495
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,180
or some place like that where it's not so cold

496
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,190
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

497
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,020
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

498
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,110
that should be found out.

499
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,030
And whatever you find out

500
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,130
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

501
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,090
you'd better do it.

502
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,980
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

503
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,020
whenever I tell you something,

504
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,100
don't take it to the extremes

505
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,100
and don't take a little bit of it.

506
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,210
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

507
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,040
that whatever is good for you,

508
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:19,990
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

509
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,150
you have to take something that will nourish that,

510
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,210
that will improve you and give you a balance.

511
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,090
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

512
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,060
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

513
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,210
both these things are important.

514
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,190
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

515
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,090
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

516
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,030
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

517
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,080
and what an important role He plays.

518
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,060
So May God bless you.

519
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,090
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

520
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,090
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

521
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,190
it's just going into the left all the time.

522
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,070
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

523
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,000
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

524
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,020
But it will work out.

525
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,200
May God bless you!

526
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,090
Terrible thing this left side is.

527
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,070
I think if you have any problems you must ask Me also,

528
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,970
because this is the only time

529
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,010
when we can talk about things.

530
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,100
If you have any problems you can ask Me, about left side:

531
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,160
how to correct it,

532
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
how to work it out, anything. Please ask Me.

533
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,010
Because you always get this problem.

534
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,190
What's it? Can't hear.

535
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,170
A yogi asks about the feeling

536
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,070
of pins and needles and the left heart

537
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,090
Now heart as I told you is the reflection of God Almighty,

538
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,090
which is the Spirit.

539
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,990
So we have two types of heart troubles as I told you before also.

540
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,140
One is, is when you have a overactive life, right-sided,

541
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,130
and the left-sided is the lethargic heart

542
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,110
when you get angina and all that.

543
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,990
Now in your case, your case where you feel

544
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:24,010
there is something pricking you,  that means it's a possession.

545
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,000
If the hands are, sort of pins and needles

546
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,040
then it's kind of possession.

547
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,110
But it can be cleared out.

548
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,050
Any other question?

549
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,070
Can You say something about left Nabhi, Mother?

550
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,110
That's a different area, though

551
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,990
left Nabhi comes from the relationship

552
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,100
between a wife and a husband mostly.

553
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,030
But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a,

554
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,000
all the time grudging,

555
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,160
very nervous and bothers the husband,

556
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,040
frightened and all sorts of things that they do.

557
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,210
You see just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband,

558
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,130
but sometimes basically

559
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,080
they are very left-sided, possessed women.

560
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:33,200
And these possessed women give you this left Nabhi.

561
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,020
Any woman who feels the left Nabhi,

562
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,200
she must immediately understand that there's some sort of

563
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,110
a horrible thing in her being which has to go out.

564
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,170
So for left Nabhi you must take to three candle treatment

565
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,990
and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him.

566
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,980
Because these spirits can also dominate,

567
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,120
you know, not that, they can make you very sly,

568
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,150
they can also dominate, they have a way of dominating.

569
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,000
So in any case it looks as if a woman

570
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,980
might look to be right-sided,

571
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,090
but actually she's suffering from left Nabhi

572
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,150
and she's extremely dominating.

573
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,210
In the same way, if the husband is not a good man

574
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,060
and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it

575
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,020
and she's sorry about it,

576
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,150
then also she catches the left Nahbi.

577
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,090
So in both cases one has to understand

578
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,090
that you get your joy,

579
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,180
 the source of joy is your Self, your own spirit.

580
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,080
It doesn't depend on your husband or anyone,

581
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,040
you are single that way.

582
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,100
So you shouldn't worry about your husband,

583
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,170
you shouldn't think how he treats you,

584
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,070
you shouldn't bother at all about him.

585
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,060
But what you have to think is that "After all, I'm his wife,

586
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,180
I should support him, I should help him.

587
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,140
Whatever way he is,

588
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,020
let him be as he is,

589
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,000
because he won't get corrected even if I tell him.

590
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,160
So the best thing is I'd better not tell him anything.

591
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,160
Let him do whatever he likes."

592
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,120
And you clear out your left Nahbi with the candle.

593
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,160
That's the way.

594
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,080
All right, we'll get the children to wash My feet now.

595
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,020
It's so very difficult, left side is still there. I'm just...

596
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,160
Hello.

597
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,060
You all get to come here to wash My feet – all right?

598
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,060
So beautiful!

599
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,000
Mantras

600
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,990
Ganesha Sthuthi

601
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,050
Who knows all the Ganesha Sthuthi to be sung?

602
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,000
Or you know Atharva Sheersh?

603
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,990
Because Ganesha is the One, you see,

604
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,970
who is sitting on Mooladhara,

605
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,010
and it is He who is the One who puts you onto the left side.

606
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,010
He throws you all the time.

607
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,050
And it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you.

608
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,000
So there are two forces working.

609
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,100
Take this.

610
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,990
He says he has got the names of Bhairavanath,

611
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,130
so it’s very good.

612
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,150
So you can come and wash My hands,

613
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,200
those who are leaders here.

614
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,200
Leaders! Big joke about them!

615
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,990
Somebody should come here to put all the things.

616
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,070
Who can do it?

617
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,080
Now what – somebody?

618
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,180
One by one you can come and put the water in.

619
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,030
Just put the water.

620
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,070
No, no, not the … You have to do it.

621
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,030
Now, one by one, come along.

622
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:51,160
First of all is the honey. Call him.

623
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,070
Take that one. This other one. …

624
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,190
We need you again. …

625
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,180
Be careful. It should not touch your fingers …

626
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,210
What is, this is clean?…

627
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,160
I thought it was …

628
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,110
From Melbourne, somebody can come …

629
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,120
What is that?

630
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,980
These are the Ida Nadi names.

631
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,970
Unmarried girls.

632
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,050
With this finger you do like that, on both the sides.

633
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,080
Debbie, come and do it.

634
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,060
Yes, it’s all right.

635
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,140
Just beyond that. Just put the line like that.

636
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,070
This side. It’s to be done like this.

637
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,110
And on the back.

638
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,040
You then have to put it under My, on the sole.

639
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,170
You can move all the things.

640
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,010
Are you doing on this side as well?

641
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,110
Also down there. You have to complete as well.

642
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,050
That’s all done.

643
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:34,130
To the line, up to the line you have to do the same thing.

644
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:40,980
Whole thing up there. Yes. All right. And more.

645
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,190
Just to the line, you just do that.

646
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,070
That’s good.

647
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,990
Still complete it.

648
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,970
Yes, correct. Yes, that’s it.

649
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:31,040
I mean, whatever you’ve put, more of that.

650
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,070
That’s it. That’s correct.

651
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:49,040
Now, I mean, extra that you have on My fingers –

652
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,160
on My toes, just take it out.

653
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,000
Now, can you get some married ladies also?

654
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,140
Too much. With your hands, take it out.

655
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:34,040
That’s better. Take this also.

656
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,150
Be careful. Don’t spoil the line. Don’t spoil the line.

657
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,990
This line you should not spoil.

658
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:54,040
Yes, be careful. It’s all right.

659
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:30,020
There’s so much to be done.

660
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:35,030
There’s a sari here. Just wipe your hand on this ….

661
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,160
Now, what you can do is to get the sari.

662
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,070
Brought the sari?

663
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,050
Take it down there. All right.

664
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:55,050
Call one of them, who are other assisting, in front.

665
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,200
The girls have to sit here.

666
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,980
Yes, this one … Give it to her, with a …

667
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:22,130
You can take that coconut.

668
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,180
Bangles.

669
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:57,010
You see, there are small and big.

670
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,010
because it’s two-and-a-half …

671
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,010
Better let them come now.

672
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,130
They have to come.

673
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,090
You have to do the sari.

674
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:40,180
Now you have to organise these flowers, under My feet,

675
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:43,190
but all the white under My feet,

676
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,180
ones on the side …

677
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:59,180
So you put all the white, and I’ll put My feet afterwards.

678
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,110
Now the light colors, like pink.

679
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,020
Leaders …

680
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:13,070
Namaskar …

681
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:32,070
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

682
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,120
See how everything is quiet.

683
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:48,990
Just before Aarti it started raining,

684
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:52,970
and now see … beautiful. All right.

685
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:13,110
You take a photograph of My feet? Just leave this …
