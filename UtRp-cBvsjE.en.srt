1
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,510
It is a great pleasure for Me,

2
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,560
greatest joy

3
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,620
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

4
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,560
for the Guru Puja.

5
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,580
It’s very gratifying

6
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:18,550
to think that there are so many,

7
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:27,440
so many of you who are disciples.

8
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,510
It was never expected

9
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,440
that I’ll have so many,

10
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,600
so many people following Me.

11
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:03,600
It is being expected

12
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,440
that you all will

13
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,410
follow My message of Love.

14
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,600
I do not have to say anything for Love.

15
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:38,550
Love is absolute gift,

16
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:49,410
gift of just feeling others.

17
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,600
There is no talking about it,

18
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,400
discussing about it, nothing;

19
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,550
just you feel that Love.

20
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:20,510
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

21
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,400
but how can you have a heart?

22
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:32,430
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

23
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:43,570
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

24
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,590
that you can feel that Love.

25
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,630
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

26
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:05,400
Love has its own qualities

27
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,450
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

28
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Its understanding is not in words,

29
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,400
not in thought,

30
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,400
but understands within.

31
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,570
It can feel within,

32
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,630
which is very important.

33
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,570
This is the most important part

34
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,510
one has to realize

35
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,460
that Love you can only feel it.

36
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,410
You cannot talk about it,

37
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,540
you cannot show about it,

38
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,630
but it is within and you can feel it.

39
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,550
And that is why today

40
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:18,510
is your celebration of the Guru.

41
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,620
It’s the celebration where

42
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,430
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

43
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,570
That feeling is within

44
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,480
and only in within you can feel that.

45
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,560
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

46
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,630
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

47
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,590
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

48
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,550
This you can have because

49
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,630
it is just there.

50
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,590
No one can give you,

51
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,410
no one can sell it,

52
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,490
no one can share it - it’s just there.

53
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,430
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

54
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,620
It has nothing to do with others;

55
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,600
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

56
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,430
It’s within yourself,

57
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,410
this feeling,

58
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,590
this depth is there which you enjoy.

59
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,530
It is the capacity -

60
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,480
every one has this, lots of it.

61
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,620
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

62
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,510
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

63
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:42,470
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

64
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,550
Sea, you cannot say

65
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,610
today is full and tomorrow is not.

66
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,530
It is eternal.

67
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:00,480
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

68
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,580
You cannot measure it,

69
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,450
it’s difficult.

70
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,510
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

71
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:37,530
and it shows your understanding,

72
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,550
your understanding of Love,

73
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,530
which has no words,

74
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,550
which cannot explain;

75
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,500
but by itself you will know

76
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,530
that "I have this quality to love

77
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,550
within myself

78
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,560
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

79
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:16,480
This is a very unique gift

80
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:26,450
which only very few human beings have.

81
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,560
Among animals also you find people who have love,

82
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,450
but that love is not deep,

83
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,420
that love has no meaning.

84
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,500
It has some purpose maybe,

85
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,630
but it is not human,

86
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,580
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

87
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:09,530
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

88
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,640
It is not easy to describe

89
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,640
or explain Love in human words.

90
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,450
This you can only feel within your Self.

91
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,550
That is what, once you start feeling,

92
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,550
you can feel who is your Guru,

93
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:48,590
Whom do you think you are being taught

94
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,450
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

95
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,550
All that is possible.

96
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,640
Everything is possible,

97
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,450
humanly possible,

98
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,440
but to love and to enjoy Love

99
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,470
is not so easy,

100
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,520
unless and until you are immersed in it.

101
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,410
It’s very gratifying,

102
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,590
it is very lovable

103
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,580
to see how people love each other

104
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:51,640
and then this Love spreads.

105
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,590
Love begets Love.

106
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:07,410
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

107
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,450
You need not tell anyone,

108
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,610
you need not confess it,

109
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,500
but it will spread.

110
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,560
And this is what one has to learn,

111
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,560
how to see that Love in other person.

112
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,470
Somehow,

113
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,540
we are here already in Love

114
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,640
because of Sahaj happening.

115
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,590
We all love

116
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,540
and we enjoy love,

117
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,500
shows on our faces

118
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
that we are in Love;

119
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,420
in our characters,

120
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,430
in our lives,

121
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,420
that we are in Love.

122
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,450
What a thing,

123
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,530
which is not very normal,

124
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,640
becomes so normal

125
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,480
and so easily available.

126
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,540
It is a very big blessing

127
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,640
that you are human beings

128
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,490
and that this source of Love

129
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:47,480
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

130
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,640
It’s a very intricate situation

131
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,450
which cannot be explained in words,

132
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,460
only one can be in it

133
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,570
and enjoy it.

134
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,530
So today is the day

135
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,620
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

136
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,540
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

137
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:34,460
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

138
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
which somehow or other leads us.

139
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,640
We are lead into that

140
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:50,500
great line of understanding,

141
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,480
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

142
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,560
to any school for education.

143
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,400
It is something so much within

144
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:12,530
that it works and expresses itself,

145
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,560
expresses like a light.

146
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,450
Such people we can make out because

147
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
they are fully enlightened.

148
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,450
They have light

149
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,420
and through that light they see

150
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,490
the whole world,

151
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,400
which is very innocent and simple for them.

152
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,510
We have love for our children naturally,

153
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,500
we have love for our parents naturally.

154
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,400
We have love for some people;

155
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,560
but that love is different

156
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,480
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

157
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,530
That has some connections,

158
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,610
some meanings

159
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:23,590
but this Love which is -

160
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,530
cannot be described in words,

161
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,510
has to be felt within.

162
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,600
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

163
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,640
you should have that Love within you.

164
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,480
Why do you feel it so much?

165
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,530
The reason is, Guru loves you

166
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,590
and you love Guru;

167
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,640
That’s the only reason

168
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,510
why should you love your Guru.

169
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,640
Now, there's no reason for that.

170
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,450
Because Love is Love.

171
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,460
and that is how

172
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,640
the Guru becomes very important in life.

173
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
We have people

174
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,570
who love their Guru

175
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,560
and are very much

176
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:50,420
in chaste understanding of their Love.

177
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,450
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

178
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,560
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

179
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,480
from our heart,

180
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,560
that there is this ocean within us,

181
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,430
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

182
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,420
If we are lost in that ocean,

183
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,560
then we’ll have no problems,

184
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,480
no questions.

185
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,530
Everything will be our own

186
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,500
and we can manage

187
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,500
everything without any argument,

188
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,620
without any questioning.

189
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,640
That is what is being Sahaj.

190
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,430
The Sahaj way, if you have

191
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,450
this Love, you enjoy.

192
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,430
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

193
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,610
because it is Sahaj.

194
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,530
Don’t have to make any efforts,

195
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,500
don’t have to try anything.

196
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,610
Just it is there and it works.

197
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,500
The feeling of Love

198
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:35,510
has no way of expressing itself.

199
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
It is just there,

200
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,470
it cannot express,

201
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,590
because it is without expression.

202
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,620
It is just to be felt within yourself.

203
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,610
Then you want to do so many things:

204
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,450
you want to help everyone,

205
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,450
you want to help yourself,

206
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,560
you want to do good to others.

207
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,590
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

208
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,610
because they had that Love.

209
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,400
They had nothing else but this Love

210
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,540
which they could not contain them within themselves,

211
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,640
so, they tried to spread it.

212
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,560
And they are called now as our Guru,

213
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,560
as our masters.

214
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,600
With that Love within,

215
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,640
which approached people in that unique manner.

216
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,610
That’s the thing that

217
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,600
we cannot possess,

218
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,490
you cannot claim -

219
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
it is there

220
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
and it works,

221
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,490
it works automatically.

222
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,600
This is what we have to know,

223
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:23,520
that we are that Love.

224
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,600
That Love is within us.

225
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,600
We have to have knowledge,

226
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,460
we have to have a complete knowledge

227
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,420
that we are that Love.

228
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,560
That will solve our problem,

229
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,570
because you can explain everything,

230
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,570
all your behaviour,

231
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,400
all your failures,

232
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,610
everything you can explain

233
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,430
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

234
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,570
This is what is the Guru

235
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,430
is the Love within you

236
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
which wants to share

237
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,540
Love with others,

238
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,610
which wants to give Love to others.

239
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,460
This is what is peace and joy.

240
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,570
I can go on talking on Love,

241
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,570
but to feel it

242
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,550
within yourself is the biggest thing.

243
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,490
Like water:

244
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,580
if you are thirsty,

245
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,460
we can give you water,

246
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,600
but we cannot drink.

247
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,470
You have to drink water

248
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,630
and you have to

249
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,570
feel the taste,

250
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,430
feel the feeling,

251
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,500
what it does,

252
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,640
and all that is together,

253
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,500
that’s not separate.

254
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,610
I don’t think the subject

255
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,580
was too subtle for you people.

256
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
You all have reached a certain amount

257
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,610
of understanding of that Love.

258
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,470
I hope, it grows

259
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,520
and you grow into it,

260
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,490
all of you, and enjoy it.

261
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,540
May God bless you!
