00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 
9 November 2003

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,120
Today is the great day of Diwali.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,520
That means today is the great day .....(?)

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,580
lights of your heart together

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,417
to make a greater light

6
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:26,125
for the world to move in a proper direction.

7
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:34,500
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

8
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:38,208
are spreading also great joy.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,125
But the problems are there, as they say,

10
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:51,500
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,125
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

12
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:58,208
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:11,125
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

14
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:16,125
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,125
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

16
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,625
but it is from within the source,

17
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,917
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,208
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
and our small petty things like jealousies

20
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:52,917
and competitions and all those things which spoilus

21
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,709
must be washed away.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,709
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

23
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:12,333
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

24
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:20,125
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

25
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,917
and forgets these petty problems.

26
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:38,041
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

27
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,333
it's all luck that we got it,

28
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,208
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

29
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,834
But it has just happened,

30
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:58,834
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

31
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,125
guided and looked after.

32
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,417
You are already blessed people,

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,417
there is no doubt about it.

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,625
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

35
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:16,417
It will all work out very well, you will see,

36
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,625
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

37
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:29,917
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

38
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,250
This is the promise of Diwali

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,417
to you all, that you will reach highest

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:48,250
and the noblest way of life.

41
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:56,333
Every word I say will be there

42
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,250
to prove what I say is there.

43
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,041
Whatever petty problems you have,

44
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,250
they'll all be washed off.

45
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,542
All these are the messages from the Divine,

46
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,458
you don't have to worry about petty things,

47
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:25,041
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

48
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,250
Your destiny will work it out.

49
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:35,333
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

50
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:41,667
I hope you believe in that promise

51
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:49,458
and are joyous in the highest way.

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,540
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

53
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,542
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

54
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,667
Thank you very much.
