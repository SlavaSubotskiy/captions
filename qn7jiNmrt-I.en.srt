1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:05,460
Shri Hanumana had attained it.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,720
Just as Anjani Devi (Mother of Shri Hanumana)
had attained it.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,280
Like Anjani Devi and Hanumana, if we can,

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,570
see the Spirit residing in our heart,

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,500
if we get our Self-Realization,

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,920
then there will be no question standing before us.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
All pain, wretchedness, poverty can go far away.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,050
We have many principles within us.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,259
They are still in the dormant state.

10
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:39,809
They should get awakened.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,780
Unless they get awakened, there is no meaning of our lives.

12
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:48,852
Our connection with God Almighty has not been established until now.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,100
Till our relationship with God Almighty is not established,

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,950
how we will enter then into His Kingdom?

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,364
And how we will get the boons that He wants to bestow upon us.

16
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,970
That's why our relationship with God Almighty

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,600
has to be established and has to be everlasting.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,610
This is the main thing, that it has to be ever-lasting.

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,350
If meaninglessly we repeatedly call Vitthala

20
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:17,588
and if He comes and stands before you, how will you recognize Him?

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,930
Thus, the Apara Bhakti which exists

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,830
and which is done without seeing, without knowing God Almighty,

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,330
its fruit is today our Sahaja Yoga.

24
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,070
To Ganesha we say,

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,480
that, "Spontaneously we dived into the current

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
so at the time of salvation, You protect us".

27
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:51,288
The time of salvation has arrived today.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,882
It must be preserved and we should stay forever in it.

29
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,610
For that there is no need to give money.

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,250
God doesn't know what to do with money.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,602
This many people may not know that to God money is unknown.

32
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:07,710
Now we went to rural places and told them, “See,

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,930
you should not give us money or anything like that."

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,290
So they said, "Instead of 10 paisa should we give 20?"

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,850
Does God understand money?

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,550
When Shri Rama has come here,

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,320
did He know what for are the money?

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Otherwise, there is an example of Hanumana,

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,310
that Sitaji gave Him a big necklace of gold,

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,750
and He was breaking every jewel seeing into it.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,670
They said, "Why are You breaking these golden balls?"

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,300
He said, "I'm seeing if there is Shri Rama in it or not?

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,150
In none of it is Shri Rama."

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,160
The whole gold He thought was useless and He threw it away.

45
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,140
Because Shri Rama was not there the gold was useless.

46
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,137
This is what Hanumana showed you.

47
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,629
Hence, Shri Ram who is residing within us,

48
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,700
has to be attained by us.

49
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,900
And after travelling in Shri Rama's kingdom,

50
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,750
all our sorrows will end. This we know.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,310
And that happens.

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,530
I want to tell you of a recent miracle.

53
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,240
It doesn't mean that you should believe in it,

54
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,150
but, it can happen, and has happened

55
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,270
and similarly all of you should get your wellbeing

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,830
and all of you should be happy.

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,260
That's why God has made this plan,

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,190
that "My devotees who are living in India,

59
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,720
who have kept so much faith in God Almighty,

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,360
should verily get this.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,490
They should verily get this. They should be blessed,

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,790
that your benevolence should manifest.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,900
You should attain God.

64
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,560
I'll tell you an experience.

65
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,850
There is a small village called as Kalwa.

66
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,490
A householder by the name Rajaram Patil stays there.

67
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,150
He was very humbly placed in life, his situation was very humble.

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,421
And he used to attend My program

69
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:51,273
and would bring along his son and other fellows.

70
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:54,190
So he used to bring his family and friends from Kalwa,

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,447
and would bring garlands and things for Me. I said, "Rajaram Patil,

72
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:00,909
at least allow Me to pay for your conveyance, it's too much for you.

73
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,910
You feel like meeting Me is alright but how do you manage this?"

74
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,355
He said, "God arranged everything for me, Mother."

75
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:08,000
I asked him, "What happened?"

76
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,244
He said, “I had a small uncultivated plot of land.

77
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,079
There, I do meditation in the morning.

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,453
One day a man came and said, "Your land has some special properties.

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,841
Using this soil,

80
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,920
someone told me that the bricks become like stones.

81
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,420
That's why we have come here to see it.

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,840
And this soil we shall buy in units of share (measuring unit).

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,600
That land which he thought was barren and has abandoned,

84
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,109
it got transformed into gold.

85
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,061
This golden Dwarika, God can establish for you,

86
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,530
if you attain God.

87
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,920
His principle is extremely great. Many people just do not accept.

88
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,524
Educated people do not accept that there is some Power of God.

89
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,920
Now, just see around, all these trees that we see

90
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,009
where do they come from? Who made them green?

91
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,590
Who produces mangoes in a mango tree?

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,710
Why does it not bear any other fruit?

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,180
All this is being done by the Divine Power.

94
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,580
And you are going to witness today
if this Divine Power exists or not.

95
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,734
And when that Divine Power of God will come in you

96
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,430
then the dormant, extremely

97
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,390
deep type of principles, even the principle of Lakshmi itself,

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,050
will get awakened and your life will change tremendously.

99
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,160
People got many benefits out of Sahaja Yoga. First and foremost is

100
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,400
that people have attained physical well being.

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,750
Physical illnesses get cured.

102
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:37,655
Because of that plenty of our money and

103
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,200
troubles get saved.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,290
Then, many people who have mental problems get cured.

105
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,550
Then, many who have intellectual problems are saved from them.

106
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,798
You are luckily not so highly educated,

107
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,405
having less intellectual problems.

108
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:56,180
Highly educated people have plenty of intellectual problems.

109
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,911
So, lacking those problems is a good thing.

110
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,520
And, after that

111
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,000
those people

112
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,200
who have Lakshmi problems (financial problems), that also gets solved.

113
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,349
This way, many problems which we are in fear of, get destroyed,

114
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,180
and we enter into the Kingdom of God

115
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,600
and there we live in peace and joy.

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,168
This is Sahaja Yoga,

117
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,827
and no matter how much is told about it, it's still too less.

118
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:31,790
I mean I'm constantly, daily, giving one lecture.

119
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,060
And at every place,

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,260
I speak so much and still people say that I have said something new.

121
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,963
So, there is no end to it.

122
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,411
If you have any question, please ask Me now.

123
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,819
He was Pawan Putra (Son of Wind God), isnt it?

124
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,879
So the wind is blowing.

125
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,880
Ha, if there are any questions, you should ask.

126
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,760
Are there no questions?

127
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,860
Some questions should be asked, isn't it?

128
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,130
O.k. Now I'll tell you one question.

129
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,623
One question which should be asked is,

130
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,859
"Mataji how does this all happen?

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,370
How does it take place?" Shouldn't we ask such a question?

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,100
Just because somebody says something, we should not believe it.

133
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,820
You should ask, "How can it be like this? You say so,

134
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,560
all these big stories are true or not?"

135
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,650
So within us there is one such power,

136
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,060
which is known as Kundalini.

137
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,457
She resides at the base of our spine in the triangular bone,

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
coiled like a serpent.

139
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,000
She is stationed as a power in the shape of three and a half coils.

140
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,120
This power is called as Kundalini.

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,046
And since immemorial times She has been described

142
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,438
by Dattatreya and so on.

143
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:27,363
It is described in many books. Markandeya existed 1400 years back.

144
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,600
Even he has described Kundalini.

145
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,530
In the Devi Mahatmyam and Devi Puran that he has written

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,834
he has described the Kundalini.

147
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,870
This power is in a dormant state within us,

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,740
because this power is our pure desire, our true desire.

149
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:50,021
Now we think that our true desire means that today

150
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,550
if we have a house is enough, It is not so.

151
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,359
If you get the house then you want to have a vehicle.

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,400
After the vehicle you want to have children.

153
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,287
After children you want something else.

154
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:02,650
So which is the pure, true desire?

155
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,190
She is a power within us. Pure desire is

156
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,261
that our relationship with God Almighty

157
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,434
should be established,

158
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,869
that we should meet God Almighty,

159
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,990
that our connection (Yoga) with God Almighty should be established.

160
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,680
This is the pure desire and it has not yet been awakened.

161
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,590
She is the Kundalini power which resides in our triangular bone.

162
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,060
If She gets awakened then this work manifests.

163
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,370
And many times She will also be visible to your eyes.

164
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,620
In the triangular bone She is working like a heart,

165
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,650
because She pulsates.

166
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,030
And if that Kundalini power gets awakened,

167
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
the cool breeze of the divine power starts flowing in our hands.

168
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,513
and you experience chaitanya which spreads in all four directions.

169
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,460
This Divine Power which is working in all four directions

170
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,420
which does all the Divine work,

171
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,400
is first and foremost experienced.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,310
And how to do it? That in short words,

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,497
I am thinking to do it now. But if you have questions better ask.

174
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,910
Ask, ask because otherwise your attention remains there, I've seen.

175
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,480
Ask, ask.

176
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,770
Ask. A question or so should be asked.

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,100
S: (Inaudible)

178
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,450
SM: [unclear]

179
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,913
S: The road going to and from the Hanuman Temple and vehicle -

180
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:46,101
these issues raised by the Trust;
will this pure desire get fulfilled?

181
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,040
SM: It will happen.

182
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,230
But it is not such a big issue.

183
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,056
Road for going to Hanumana will be made. You do not know,

184
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:58,040
many things will come to this country,

185
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,520
but with that your satisfaction will not be gained.

186
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,670
This is the main thing to be told.

187
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,590
The road will be built, everything will happen,

188
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,079
maybe here one of our ashrams will also be built.

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,060
Something will happen, quite a lot will happen.

190
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,200
but still it will not bring any satisfaction.

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,740
Satisfaction will come after attaining God.

192
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,870
Means what? What will happen?

193
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,430
The biggest thing is that all your addictions will drop off.

194
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,220
For attaining Hanumana the addictions should be dropped, shouldn't they?

195
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,829
If we have all the addictions how will Hanumana be pleased with us?

196
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,370
And if you want to go to the temple, go there, get your legs broken,

197
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,800
and finally what will you get?

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,470
Then I will ask one question on behalf of God.

199
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,540
First your addictions should go away, shouldn't they?

200
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:50,680
To get the blessings of God, should
we not be capable of receiving them?

201
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,790
As I said, first you get that capability.

202
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,426
That's Mother's work, so I'll do it.

203
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,493
Hanumana's mother did everything she could.

204
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,269
Now, let your Mother do what She wants to do.

205
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,570
That capability you should attain and then everything will happen.

206
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,800
Then whatever you say will happen.

207
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,680
But first shall we not enter into the Kingdom of God?

208
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,382
Now ask the second question. The question was too good.

209
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,980
I'm a Mother after all. so there is no problem in asking Me any question.

210
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,890
Mother is all ours. We ask her all the questions, don't we?

211
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,490
If we don't ask Mother, then whom shall we ask?

212
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,960
Yes ask some more.

213
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:30,490
S: What should be done for raising the Kundalini?

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,125
SM: That's the right question.

215
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,501
That I will do. I'll tell you about, but otherwise?

216
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:38,190
Right. He asked the right question. This is a seeker's question.

217
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,390
This is the right question. For that very little has to be done.

218
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,054
She rises spontaneously.

219
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,932
As if there is some seed. If we want to sprout it, what do we do?

220
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,912
You will say, "Plant it in the Mother Earth".

221
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,570
It's just like that. This is the work of the Mother Earth.

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,610
It happens spontaneously.

223
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:58,185
"Saha-ja", "Saha" means: born with you.

224
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,401
This Kundalini is born with you.

225
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,561
And the connection that you get with Her,

226
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:05,129
is your right, it's your birth right.

227
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,555
Getting the connection established is your birth right.

228
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,613
That you should take.

229
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,004
Once you get enlightened, just like a lamp enlightens another one,

230
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:18,730
similarly you can enlighten others also.

231
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,280
Just a little bit of it you should know.

232
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,670
Small children can also do it. Everyone can do it.

233
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,952
Now ask one more question and then we will do it.

234
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,952
S: Provision for water also?

235
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,570
SM: Yes, everything.

236
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,620
Everything that you have asked for, is material.

237
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,519
Provision for water should be made, there's so much poverty,

238
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,020
there's so much distress.

239
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,310
If I'm to speak, the village from where my father hailed,

240
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,392
I'd been to that village...

241
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,145
L: What is this Sahaja Yoga?

242
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:57,100
SM: What did she say?

243
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:06,458
What do you want, tell Me.

244
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:11,375
What did she say? Her language is different.

245
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:14,265
How should a person get rid of Tamo guna?

246
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:17,170
How can we establish oneness and affection with others?

247
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:20,647
The Tamo-guna that exists in a person, how can it be reduced?

248
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:23,237
And, how can a person experience oneness with others.

249
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,090
SM: That's right. That's a very nice question.

250
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,814
His question is related to dharma,

251
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,999
that how can we get the feeling of love for others.

252
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,480
Because of Tamo-guna we don't feel love for others;

253
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:39,729
also because of Rajo-guna when people become bumptious.

254
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,750
Then how does this happen?

255
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,020
Now, these people are here from 14 countries.

256
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,670
They have love for you. They came here to meet you.

257
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,240
But you people lack oneness. What's the reason for that?

258
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Now see this finger of Mine;

259
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,344
if it gets hurt,

260
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't need to tell anyone, because if I get hurt,

261
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,090
then I will soothe it and relieve it Myself.

262
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,070
Isn't it? Because it's My own finger.

263
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,822
Similarly, you are part and parcel of the Viratha Purusha.

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,200
All of you are! But still the awareness is missing,

265
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:21,750
the awareness that we are part and parcel of Almighty God

266
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,555
This awareness is missing.

267
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,466
The moment this Realization takes place,

268
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,509
the cool breeze comes in your hands,

269
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,690
and a new awareness gets awakened.

270
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,990
Now, we have various awarenesses.

271
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,828
Compared to animals we are much more evolved.

272
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,273
Evolution has taken place.

273
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,070
Suppose an animal is told,

274
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,660
"You walk across this filth", it will walk across.

275
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,881
But, if you tell a human being, he won't be able to.

276
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,910
But, when you realize your Self

277
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,817
then, the first and foremost awareness that you get is,

278
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,080
that we all are part and parcel of the same Being.

279
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,830
On you fingers you will know

280
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,530
what problems a person is having.

281
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,690
What problems does a person have?

282
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,670
His stomach is paining. You'll be sitting and you'll say,

283
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,970
"Do you have a headache?", "How do you know?".

284
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,440
Means, "I know it through my fingers".

285
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,440
Your fingers  will start speaking

286
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,870
and you will know that he has that problem,

287
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,140
that his one chakra or another is catching.

288
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,320
That means that the collective consciousness gets awakened.

289
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,091
Who is the other?

290
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,781
It is told to Me, "Mataji, You have done lot of favors",

291
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,391
but who is the other?

292
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,300
If everyone is part and parcel of our being, then who is the other?

293
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,572
If you are having any pain I'll also get the pain.

294
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,870
If I remove my own pain then what favor have I bestowed upon you?

295
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,020
So, this awareness is not yet awakened in us.

296
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,230
Once it gets awakened,

297
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,452
we'll give our life for each other because as our nose, eyes, mouth

298
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,260
is all ours, similarly all these people are also ours;

299
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,410
this awareness comes into us.

300
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,520
This is an awareness and it comes within us.

301
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:07,842
This is the transition from the state of "human" to "super-human".

302
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,878
When a human becomes a super-human

303
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,060
then we realize what are the troubles of others.

304
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,940
This awareness has to be awakened.

305
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,880
And that will happen.

306
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,709
Then there will be love among us. Jealously, hatred, all will go.

307
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,195
Because we are all one, we should help each other.

308
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,758
Because we are one, one and the same being.

309
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,080
But because this awareness is not yet awakened,

310
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,900
due to the ignorance,

311
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,201
this knowledge has to be awakened within,

312
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,223
we should feel it on our central nervous system.

313
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,960
On your fingers you should feel it.

314
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,310
It should be felt. Jaaniv, is a very good Marathi word.

315
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,440
You should know it, not with your brain,

316
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,760
like saying "we are brothers and sisters" and then start quarrelling.

317
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,070
We should feel it from within.

318
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,500
This will happen in the whole universe.

319
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,429
All right? Very nice question.

320
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,245
Such thought should exist

321
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,344
that there should be oneness between all of us.

322
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,550
We are all one, but due to the ignorance,

323
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,270
blind people always feel that we are all different.

324
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,160
But once we get the vision then we are all one,

325
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,460
then there is no difference.

326
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,280
As they say Avya(Spirit) has no caste.

327
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,710
The one who becomes a Yogi, to him caste and so on. has no meaning.

328
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,090
It's all the same.

329
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,920
O.k. now, what has to be done for it?

330
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,919
First of all I'm a Mother, so no need of wearing a cap in front of Me.

331
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,223
You sit straight as you sit in front of your mother.

332
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,346
Sit as you sit in front of your mother, absolutely simple and sober.

333
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:47,157
There should be no difficulty in it. Sit in a very simple posture.

334
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,851
How do we sit in front of our mother?

335
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:52,527
Think of it while sitting in front of Me.

336
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,741
You should have the same kind of love that you have for your mother.

337
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:57,309
All our work is that of love.

338
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,657
So we should sit in complete love.

339
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,436
Now, just place both the hands like this on your lap, slowly.

340
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:08,043
Place them like this slowly.

341
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,501
Quietly.

342
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,440
And now we should close our eyes. Everybody should close the eyes.

343
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:43,866
No giggling. See,

344
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:47,141
it's not going to work out like this. Be quiet,

345
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,960
we are doing Divine work, aren't we?

346
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,970
Close your eyes. Close your eyes and sit down.

347
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,950
What's there to giggle in closing your eyes?

348
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,680
Because of this in our villages,

349
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,761
that's why it doesn't work out in villages.
