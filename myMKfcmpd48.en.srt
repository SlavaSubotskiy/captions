1
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:38,497
I thank Mr. Emro

2
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:42,698
for inviting Me to such a unique type of gathering.

3
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:53,177
The subject is very interesting

4
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:58,578
that how Sahaja Yoga can help beauty.

5
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:03,817
Now Sahaja Yoga, as you know, here it is shown

6
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:10,897
that there is a power in your triangular bone, here, as you see.

7
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:14,818
And this is in every human being - every.

8
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,538
And this power, has to be awakened.

9
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:31,698
Then it passes through these six centers.

10
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:35,014
The seventh one low below there, the number one,

11
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:37,930
and

12
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,751
pierces through your fontanel bone area

13
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:46,222
and connects you to the Divine.

14
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,697
As a result of that,

15
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:55,701
all these centers who are responsible, they are responsible

16
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,777
for our physical, mental, emotional

17
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,937
and also spiritual being,

18
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:04,759
all of them are enlightened and integrated.

19
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:10,897
It, this power is in everyone but

20
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:14,377
to talk about it, people don't believe in it.

21
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,817
You must have the experience of it.

22
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:20,457
And once you have the experience, you'll be amazed,

23
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,097
how many things happen to you

24
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:26,857
which you cannot even imagine.

25
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,497
It's very kind of him to have called me here, that way

26
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:33,257
I've met many people of that kind

27
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,577
but nobody has tried to invite others

28
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,471
who could share this experience.

29
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,778
Now coming to the point of beauty,

30
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,467
I must tell you the Divine is the most beautiful thing,

31
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:53,897
because it creates all beautiful things.

32
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:58,818
You see in the nature, every leaf is different from another.

33
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:03,811
Such a variety. Also, if you see,

34
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:08,736
all leaves are so arranged that they all get sunshine.

35
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:13,538
Such a consideration, such an understanding.

36
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:19,563
In the same way, when Divine works in you,

37
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:23,897
you also have that capacity

38
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:28,615
to share it with others, understand with others

39
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,817
and to be part and parcel of the whole.

40
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:35,171
Not just yourself, single person (everything).

41
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:44,027
Now, one thing

42
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:48,338
is there that people are now conscious of their beauty.

43
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:54,138
But perhaps they don't know, how do we spoil our beauty.

44
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:59,458
First, let us see, how our beauty spoils.

45
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:05,324
It is spoiled sometimes,

46
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:09,458
showing lots of wrinkles on the face.

47
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:15,750
Now, I am 77 years of age. I'll be 78 very soon.

48
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:19,887
And I am grand-grandmother. I don't have wrinkles.

49
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:23,142
Nor my daughters have.

50
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:27,639
The reason is this,

51
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,458
that normally human beings specially ladies, react very much,

52
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:37,573
react to everything.

53
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:41,697
Whatever happens in their life, they react,

54
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:45,439
whatever happens in others lives they react,

55
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,178
whatever is happening on the other planes, they react.

56
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,331
By reacting, you do not get to anything.

57
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,343
You do not achieve anything.

58
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:03,817
So, the first thing,

59
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:07,858
I would say that when it happens, you don't react.

60
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:11,354
You just watch, you become a witness.

61
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:15,461
You become the witness of the whole thing.

62
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:21,388
And when these things happen, then the creativity

63
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:25,058
starts coming from somewhere unknown,

64
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:29,374
and you are amazed how you can create things

65
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,737
without reading any book, without taking any help,

66
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:36,044
and suddenly you become very, very creative.

67
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:42,777
I've seen in Sahaja yoga, how people have achieved

68
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,728
great heights in creativity,

69
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,777
in sports, in everything

70
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:53,898
because they get this energy, divine energy within them.

71
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:58,027
So, they also understand,

72
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:05,251
that they have to be more patient,

73
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:10,938
more loving, more caring towards themselves and towards others also.

74
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,457
Once that happens -

75
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:18,807
I've seen this one is so beautifully done -

76
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:21,938
is that you start caring for people.

77
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:28,169
You start caring for your customers, understanding them,

78
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,777
plus your creativity.

79
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:33,777
You do not borrow ideas from others,

80
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:37,097
you don't learn by your own mad thinking,

81
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:39,698
but you actually become creative

82
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:42,657
under the influence of the Divine.

83
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:46,658
And when the Divine starts working, it's perfect.

84
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:50,828
Perfection.

85
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,057
There's no competition.

86
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:57,798
You create not out of competition, but just to create.

87
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:01,437
Freely. There's no compulsion.

88
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:05,614
And when you start creating, you are amazed at yourself,

89
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:08,497
how can you create all these things

90
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:13,858
with whatever knowledge you have, whatever experience you have?

91
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,177
All these things happen.

92
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:21,746
I'm happy it has happened in the case of Mr. Emro

93
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:26,698
and that he has taken that he should pass this to you people.

94
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:31,607
Now in modern times,

95
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:34,880
fashion has become very popular.

96
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:41,170
So it's alright. But the fashion that you (use)

97
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:46,706
how far it is helpful

98
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:50,475
to you in your health, that you should see to it.

99
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,778
Now if I reveal certain things, you should not be shocked

100
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:56,840
and should be unhappy about.

101
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,618
All these centers are

102
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:06,233
expressed in our different parts of the body.

103
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,842
For example, this green one that you see.

104
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:14,938
It's here in the Nabhi, is expressed on these two knees.

105
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:21,537
Very important - two knees are very important.

106
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,170
So, if you want to keep your knees

107
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:26,698
in perfect health, I would say

108
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:29,177
one should not expose the knees.

109
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,177
If you expose the knees, everybody sees that.

110
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:35,021
And there are lots of negative forces around.

111
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,711
What's the use of exposing the knee? I don't understand.

112
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:42,018
About twenty years back, nobody used to do that.

113
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:44,418
But now suddenly the fashion has started,

114
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:47,150
that you expose your knees.

115
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:52,315
And exposure of knees, you will end up with very bad knees,

116
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:56,455
you won't be able to even walk. At My age -  you may not reach also.

117
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,811
So it has to be covered.

118
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:04,211
Now if you wear a covered knee thing in England,

119
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:06,258
or anywhere in the west,

120
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:09,293
they'll ask you, "Are you Turkish?"

121
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:14,497
Now, because in Turkey they know this.

122
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,738
Turkish people are still traditional -

123
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:19,773
they know, they will not expose their knees.

124
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:23,984
And exposure of knees is very dangerous.

125
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:29,206
This is a very, very important chakra - we call as a Nabhi chakra.

126
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:34,337
It is related to our

127
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:39,057
Lakshmi tatwa also - Lakshmi means the goddess of money.

128
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,858
It is expressed in so many ways within us:

129
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:45,297
our digestion, everything.

130
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,137
Apart from that, the main thing is,

131
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:54,178
it gives a very different expression to your body.

132
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,456
Supposing there's somebody who is very greedy -

133
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:03,085
you can make out from the face.

134
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:07,927
Somebody who is very jealous - you can make out, from the face.

135
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:13,813
Somebody who is very cunning - you can make out from the face.

136
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:19,286
In the same way, when you have this first center

137
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:22,297
it's very, very important,

138
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:26,360
which is too much, maybe, to tell you, but it's very important.

139
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:31,350
This is the center of your innocence.

140
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,897
This innocence is there, always.

141
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:41,512
It cannot be destroyed, it is indestructible.

142
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:45,258
Whatever you may do, whatever wrong you may commit,

143
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,630
whatever immoral thing you may do, this center is there

144
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:51,217
and innocence is there.

145
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:53,912
It might be covered with some clouds - it's different -

146
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:57,249
but nobody can destroy this center.

147
00:28:58,106 --> 00:29:00,737
Now the face that is innocent,

148
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:03,378
is always very beautiful. You see the children,

149
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:06,977
what love you have for children, because they have innocent faces.

150
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,790
This center has to be looked after.

151
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:13,004
And this center

152
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:17,242
gets distorted and spoiled

153
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:21,258
while, not that you become cunning and all that,

154
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:25,088
but it gets spoilt when you don't respect your chastity.

155
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:29,725
That's a very important thing. You may do whatever fashion you like,

156
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:33,978
but your chastity is very important - that's your power.

157
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:38,818
If you respect your chastity, nobody can destroy you.

158
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,937
That's the greatest boon

159
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,098
human beings have, whether they are men or women.

160
00:29:45,338 --> 00:29:49,697
Chastity is very important and this center

161
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:53,188
will start showing its results.

162
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:59,907
With innocence, your face becomes very innocent

163
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:04,458
and loving, lovable, like that of children.

164
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:11,138
Cunningness, you can see on the face. At least, I can see.

165
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:17,265
You can understand persons being exploiting you,

166
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:19,929
making use of you.

167
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,638
But if this center is alright,

168
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,741
then you're so powerful.

169
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:33,030
You're so powerful, that nobody can destroy your innocence.

170
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:37,698
And that is to be respected very much for the beauty.

171
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:39,822
I think I have seen women

172
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:43,298
who are every beautiful, have innocence in them.

173
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,957
They may not be sexually attractive and all that,

174
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:49,818
but the face is so innocent

175
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:53,939
so innocent, lovable!

176
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,314
Whatever may be your age, is not the point,

177
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:58,186
but you respect yourself.

178
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:00,469
First of all, if you don't respect yourself,

179
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,103
who is going to respect you?

180
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,794
Then another thing is that, the second chakra is

181
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:11,138
above that, the green one, is this red chakra.

182
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:16,445
This is for your heart. We call it the center heart.

183
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:20,857
When you are insecure, then this thing catches.

184
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:24,343
And this chakra has got a quality

185
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:27,098
by which it produces angels.

186
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:30,922
You can call them as anything - they call them antibodies.

187
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:35,217
These angels are created for your protection.

188
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:38,927
For everything. If you have any disease they'll fight it,

189
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:41,897
if you have any problems, they will fight it.

190
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:44,057
If you have any fear -

191
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:48,068
say suddenly you see a dog, tiger or something -

192
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:51,297
this center will start pulsating like that.

193
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:54,801
And this pulsation creates

194
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:59,457
a kind of a motion among these people whom I call angels.

195
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:03,835
And these angels know that there's a danger

196
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:06,377
and they try to protect you.

197
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:09,766
So this center is very important.

198
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:12,857
You must have security.

199
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,496
Your sense of security is disturbed,

200
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:20,121
when this center goes into jeopardy.

201
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:21,692
It is...

202
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:25,086
Modern times is full of insecurities.

203
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:28,917
Especially for ladies - full of insecurities.

204
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:34,367
They're always feeling, "God knows what's going to happen to me,

205
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,417
what is going to be against me".

206
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:41,336
All this is on this center, it depends.

207
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:44,685
This is the Mother's center.

208
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:50,577
And if you understood the meaning of your mother's heart,

209
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,981
or your heart as a mother,

210
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:57,981
you have understood that part, then this center settles down,

211
00:32:58,182 --> 00:32:59,698
you feel secured.

212
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:04,038
You have to be absolutely secure within yourself.

213
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,577
This is a very important point.

214
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:11,458
These days I find women are having so many breast cancers and all that.

215
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:14,736
That is also due to this center.

216
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:20,124
Why? Because if the husband is very dominating,

217
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:25,138
and very exacting, then women develop this.

218
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:29,771
And in America, you'll be amazed, in a place where women are

219
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:33,698
so well placed, so many women have this trouble.

220
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,891
I couldn't explain. I couldn't understand.

221
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:41,507
While in Indian women don't have.

222
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:45,547
Surprisingly. Because in India,

223
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:50,258
the children are the power of the mother.

224
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:56,709
Her power is not with anything else but with her children.

225
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,338
And she'll see to it that her children get proper education,

226
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,978
they are brought up well for anything,

227
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:07,871
that she has to sell her ornaments and sell everything,

228
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:11,262
but she would see that they are well educated.

229
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:14,898
And she will look after them first than anything else,

230
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:16,777
when she's a mother.

231
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,820
That doesn't mean that you give up your profession,

232
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:22,158
doesn't mean that you don't go out,

233
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,443
but you have to put full attention to your children - very important.

234
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:30,617
I show the result of that is this today:

235
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:35,503
that all the software people are coming from India. Why?

236
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,819
Why not from England and why not from other countries,

237
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,577
who are supposed to be so developed?

238
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:49,336
When I came here, I was surprised so many of my disciples,

239
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:53,657
they were not worried about their studies.

240
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,223
They said: "We want to be (big), we want to be garbage cleaners.".

241
00:34:57,544 --> 00:34:59,197
I said "Why?"

242
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,929
"Because you can get a lot of money in that way.

243
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,255
But what a student?

244
00:35:03,456 --> 00:35:05,879
Even if you are a graduate you don't get much money."

245
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,830
I said, "You don't understand your dignity,

246
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,978
you don't understand you have to progress

247
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,858
in your thinking and understanding."

248
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:17,497
They said, "No, we want to do something where we can get money.

249
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,603
We can take to anything that can give us money."

250
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:22,375
"It will give you money", I said,

251
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:25,978
"but it will not give you education and concentration."

252
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:30,158
That is the main point you should have, is your concentration.

253
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,257
And this concentration if it doesn't come,

254
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:36,859
then you cannot work out anything.

255
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,298
Thank God, I told them, "You better take to some education."

256
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:43,338
They all got admissions into good colleges, schools.

257
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,567
Now they're doing very well.

258
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,044
It's alright. You may earn later. Money is not everything.

259
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:54,347
You may earn little less but at least you have the education.

260
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,379
Now there's such a dearth of education in America,

261
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,781
among you people.

262
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:03,376
First of all, the education is extremely, extremely expensive

263
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:07,288
and those schools which are available otherwise are of no good.

264
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:09,703
So, what we find we can have better

265
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:13,257
carpenters, we can have better windows,

266
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:16,447
but no education.

267
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:21,371
So, people are pouring from India for software-ing

268
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:24,919
Because the concentration is gone.

269
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,375
So this concentration power comes from the mother, to the children,

270
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:34,145
and they have very concentrated mind.

271
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:38,529
It's very important to have that concentration

272
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,727
and the faith, as a mother.

273
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:45,258
So many people, why do they get

274
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:50,149
ladies, specially get this breast cancer - I can't understand.

275
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,925
Because they are insecure. A husband cannot make you insecure,

276
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:59,176
if you have children and if your children are to your support.

277
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:03,552
If you are even alone, you should have faith in your mother.

278
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:06,897
Such mothers if there are, who will look after you,

279
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:09,137
who will always support you,

280
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:12,498
will give you that security which is very important

281
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,417
for these antibodies.

282
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:19,178
Even the cancer and all these diseases are caused by the lack of

283
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,977
antibodies within us.

284
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:26,377
So these antibodies are like little, little, we can call angels

285
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:29,778
which look after you, which worry about you.

286
00:37:29,978 --> 00:37:33,034
This is the treasure you have within yourself

287
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:34,828
which should not be exploited.

288
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:39,018
Your security should not be allowed to challenge anyone.

289
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,858
This is, that's why I said,

290
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,202
it's a very, very important center is this one,

291
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:47,562
what you call, it's the heart chakra.

292
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,857
Now outside without Sahaja Yoga,

293
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:59,146
I don't know how one can achieve the stability of the heart.

294
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:06,973
Heart becomes weak because people lose tempers.

295
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:09,157
Those who are very hot tempered people,

296
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:11,698
they have problems on their heart.

297
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:16,973
And I have seen people they get a heart attack

298
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:19,577
and get it all kinds of heart problems

299
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:25,698
because of this chakra in danger - heart chakra.

300
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:31,308
So, insecurity on one side, and heart attacks on another side.

301
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:34,653
To get angry is very wrong.

302
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:39,498
To get angry is absolutely ruining yourself, it's self destructive.

303
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:44,258
But by telling it will not happen. You have to have Realization,

304
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,898
you must have Self Realization, by which

305
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:53,016
you become absolutely peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

306
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:57,075
Then the last chakra is this one, Vidshuddhi chakra is at the last.

307
00:38:57,276 --> 00:39:00,817
This chakra, Vishuddhi, is here -

308
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:05,135
it's important. This gets spoiled by many things.

309
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:09,397
Supposing you use abusive words,

310
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,194
if you are aggressive with your tongue.

311
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:15,805
Like in America, they use very abusive words, I was surprised.

312
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:18,698
All the time they're using stupid words

313
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,987
which I don't even understand.

314
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:24,697
All that is causing this trouble.

315
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,771
And this can go up to any limit.

316
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:32,358
Because it controls 16 of your...

317
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,104
16 of your...

318
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:38,726
I should say, organs, right? It controls your eyes,

319
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:41,793
it controls your nose, it controls your tongue,

320
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:46,056
it controls your teeth, it controls your ears,

321
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:49,304
everything are controlled, 16 things are controlled

322
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:52,103
by this Vishuddhi chakra.

323
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:56,182
And on the both sides we have the most important,

324
00:39:56,383 --> 00:40:01,497
very great chakras, which we can call, it says they rule

325
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:04,113
ourselves and the whole world.

326
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,707
These are 2 chakras, on the sides.

327
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,633
And they are,

328
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:15,506
we call them as...

329
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,221
I don't need other Indian names,

330
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:20,897
but they are very important chakras, these two.

331
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:25,868
And when you expose them, then you have problems with these.

332
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:31,550
So they should not be exposed. You can have small sleeves.

333
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,622
But never expose them.

334
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,943
Then you can get any kind of problem, any kind of problem,

335
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,520
any kind of problem,

336
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:40,999
combined with this chakra.

337
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:46,390
I'm sorry, I have to warn you people.

338
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,803
Alright. But it's a fashion now.

339
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:54,698
What is the need to expose? To please men? Why should you care?

340
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,498
Why should you care for men so much?

341
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:02,553
I can't understand. Women are the shakti, they are the power.

342
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,319
Why should you try to please men?

343
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:10,741
So why have this kind of a

344
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:13,417
inferiority complex about yourself -

345
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:16,217
all the time trying to please men.

346
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:19,397
And they are very funny, I tell you.

347
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:23,873
What has killed romance is this.

348
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:26,018
See a man falls in love with say -

349
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:29,260
I'm sorry to say this - with our hair dress.

350
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,950
There's a hair dress, a particular hair dress,

351
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:36,898
so Mr. X falls in love with that hair dress.

352
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,182
But then she goes to hairdresser, changes her dress.

353
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,533
It's over, romance is over.

354
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:48,337
They're so superficial.

355
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:53,222
They're so superficial that they can fall for your hair dress.

356
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,924
And the women feel so disappointed

357
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,773
the way the men treat them and behave.

358
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:02,091
So, I would suggest that

359
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:06,258
it's very important that you should not try to please men.

360
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:10,417
You be yourself, in your self esteem.

361
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:14,898
You are women, after all, and you have special qualities.

362
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:19,618
Stand in your own dignity. Stand in your own power.

363
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:24,658
And in this, when it happens, women get more power than men can get.

364
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:31,298
It's very surprising. And it works out so beautifully for women.

365
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:36,242
And it should. Now, for example, you are

366
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:39,337
you are yourself hairdresser or anything you are,

367
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:42,302
you become so creative.

368
00:42:42,503 --> 00:42:46,415
If you are a musician, you become very creative.

369
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:49,497
If you are anything, whatever profession you are following,

370
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:53,485
you become so very creative when this thing happens to you,

371
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:56,377
because all your centers are cleared out.

372
00:42:56,578 --> 00:43:00,321
And the power of the Divine is pouring through you.

373
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:04,649
This is what you should achieve, that is what you should have,

374
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,751
then nobody can dominate you.

375
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:12,217
Not only that, it goes higher,

376
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:16,450
this is the most important chakra, which is called,

377
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:20,011
we call it Agnya chakra between the optic chiasma like this.

378
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:23,098
And if it is not open, it is very, very constricted

379
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:25,817
if it doesn't open then Kundalini won't pass through.

380
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:29,658
Now this is the chakra of Jesus Christ where we crucified Him.

381
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:35,836
Now what did he do, He first gave forgiveness

382
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:40,524
to all the people who tried to torture Him, and crucified Him.

383
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:44,505
So only the way you forgive people, it opens out.

384
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:48,327
You have to forgive. No use to remember him.

385
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:51,998
Somebody has hurt you, alright. So what?

386
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,417
It's finished. It's not today. Whatever has happened has happened.

387
00:43:56,618 --> 00:43:58,188
Why worry about it?

388
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:00,934
But if you don't forgive, then all the time

389
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:04,177
you'll be thinking about it and will be torturing yourself

390
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:07,897
for nothing at all. Instead of that you just forgive.

391
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:11,596
Forgive everything. Forgiving is a very great quality

392
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:15,445
by which nobody can torture you, nobody can trouble you,

393
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,977
because you do not pay any attention to.

394
00:44:18,178 --> 00:44:22,161
You don't know people are trying to trouble Me so much

395
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:28,378
so much they have done to make Me, sort of hurt, or do all kinds of things.

396
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:32,402
But somehow, I forgive them. And I am finished.

397
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,388
Because once you forgive them,

398
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,766
you don't remember what they have done to you,

399
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:38,817
and you never torture yourself.

400
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:41,818
But if you don't forgive, then you torture yourself

401
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:45,058
thinking, "Why did he do this? Why did she do this?"

402
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:47,318
Nothing - you just forgive.

403
00:44:47,538 --> 00:44:52,058
The very great present of Jesus - that you should forgive everyone.

404
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:56,324
That gives you a great peace here.

405
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:02,077
But this peace also is very important.

406
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:04,354
If you don't have peace within you,

407
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:07,937
then you start becoming old very soon.

408
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:13,577
I have seen many young girls having wrinkles, worried, upset,

409
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:17,698
tension, this that, all the time irritated.

410
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:22,177
The reason is that they have not yet forgiven

411
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:24,323
those people who have troubled them.

412
00:45:24,524 --> 00:45:28,449
So if you can develop this witness state, as I said,

413
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,177
you are not bothered.

414
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:33,008
You just witness the whole thing,

415
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:36,435
and you'll be amazed that this center will be opened,

416
00:45:36,636 --> 00:45:39,776
and by that you will not react.

417
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:42,683
You will not react. You'll just see, "Alright.

418
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:45,177
This is so, so this is so."

419
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,929
And the life becomes full of humor

420
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,261
and anything absurd you see, just smile and laugh.

421
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:56,088
There's no time for you to think about these nonsensical things

422
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:02,028
that people say about you, or try to harm you, or try to

423
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,332
create a problem. You shouldn't worry.

424
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:09,468
You shouldn't worry about that. Now they...

425
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,857
With this happening,

426
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:26,258
you don't try to think what others are thinking about you.

427
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,455
because you know, you are one with Divine,

428
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:32,257
because you get vibrations on your hands,

429
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:35,737
you are assured that you are alright, so you have confidence.

430
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:39,617
But you don't with this confidence, oppress others.

431
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:42,225
It is confidence with love.

432
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:46,897
I call it as the intelligence which is emotional.

433
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,258
I call it as emotional intelligence.

434
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:51,222
Many children are born with it,

435
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:53,937
but they are taught something else so they [do with it].

436
00:46:54,138 --> 00:46:57,182
I'll say my own great grandson,

437
00:46:57,383 --> 00:47:02,418
who is born with this, so as soon as we reached America,

438
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:05,338
he was with us for only six months, he was a little boy,

439
00:47:05,578 --> 00:47:10,089
and after one, 7-8 months we went to America,

440
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:14,777
immediately he brought the remote control and gave it to my husband.

441
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:17,937
Because he is always seeing the television - immediately.

442
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,577
Then he brought newspaper and gave Me to read.

443
00:47:20,778 --> 00:47:23,621
And to Me he brought a flower.

444
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,727
So, by his emotional intelligence

445
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,267
he knows what one likes, what one has.

446
00:47:28,468 --> 00:47:31,981
If you come home or somebody visits us

447
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,497
he'll immediately bring the things to

448
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:38,854
give them to eat or to please them -

449
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:42,573
all the time, these things of entertaining.

450
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:45,617
He'll start dancing,

451
00:47:45,818 --> 00:47:49,418
and he'll start showing you dance. Have you seen it?

452
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,663
He's so careful,

453
00:47:53,864 --> 00:47:56,783
that he should express his love

454
00:47:56,984 --> 00:48:01,143
and with animals, everyone, he's so friendly.

455
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:04,542
That is emotional intelligence we should develop.

456
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:07,097
And depend on it, it helps you.

457
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:11,323
You will get lots of friends, you will gets lots of

458
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:15,977
I should say, not only friends, but people who will help you

459
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:21,458
in your work. They'll give you a great assistance in everything.

460
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:29,742
It's a very, very great capacity to be emotionally intelligent.

461
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:34,218
People think if you are emotional then people take advantage of you.

462
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,612
Let them take. What's the harm?

463
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,003
But you do no take advantage of yourself

464
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:47,218
by being cruel or by being any way harsh to others.

465
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:50,835
Remember those days when somebody was sweet?

466
00:48:51,036 --> 00:48:54,978
Remember that time, that moment when somebody was very sweet,

467
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:59,277
very nice to you, very kind, very helpful. Remember!

468
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,098
Remember all these moments, not the moments when you are insulted

469
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:05,743
not the time when you have suffered,

470
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:08,669
but the time when somebody has given you love,

471
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,987
somebody has talked to you with love,

472
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:16,338
and you'll be amazed such fragrance within you will start blowing.

473
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:22,018
So many people have got this Realization,

474
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:25,898
and they have forgotten all nonsense of fighting and all.

475
00:49:26,098 --> 00:49:28,770
Now we have sometimes people,

476
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:31,666
thousands of them in India sometimes,

477
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:35,388
and I was surprised, they come from different countries,

478
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:38,584
and Sahaja Yoga is working in 86 countries,

479
00:49:38,785 --> 00:49:40,537
and they never quarrel, they never fight.

480
00:49:40,738 --> 00:49:44,426
I've never heard anybody quarreling or fighting.

481
00:49:44,627 --> 00:49:47,578
Ha, they pull each others legs, they're very humorous.

482
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:52,698
That's they do. Now the another craze we have now in -

483
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:56,968
I don't know why - that we should be very, very thin,

484
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:00,963
that thinness is very attractive. It's not so.

485
00:50:02,258 --> 00:50:05,177
See you become thin sometimes automatically

486
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,981
if your liver is out of order,

487
00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:11,217
which is a very dangerous thing, to have a bad liver.

488
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,782
I agree, you should not be fat.

489
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:17,258
Also if you become fat very much you might develop something else.

490
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,258
But If you are naturally thin, then understand

491
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:24,185
that must be liver out of order.

492
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:26,721
Now this liver when it is out of order,

493
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:29,892
how many problems it can give, you don't know it.

494
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:33,407
First of all it can give asthma.

495
00:50:33,608 --> 00:50:37,498
It can give you a...

496
00:50:39,513 --> 00:50:44,155
if it moves on the right side, it can give you diabetes.

497
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:49,429
It can give you, this heat, if it moves downward here,

498
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,786
it can give you also the spleen into trouble

499
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:57,818
and that can ultimately give you a cancer,

500
00:50:58,173 --> 00:51:00,698
blood cancer, it can give you blood cancer.

501
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:04,853
Then if it goes to the uterus, also it can harm you there.

502
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:08,977
If this heat from the liver goes on passing throughout

503
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:12,697
and creates problems all over. Not only that,

504
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:16,658
but also it can give you a massive heart attack after some time.

505
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,761
If you are young and if you are drinking too much and

506
00:51:20,962 --> 00:51:22,711
playing tennis and all

507
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:25,641
then suddenly the heart goes off.

508
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:28,177
That is how many heart attacks come.

509
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,897
So to preserve your health within yourself,

510
00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:34,498
first you should know what you are, what problems you have,

511
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:36,340
why these problems are there.

512
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:40,578
And then also you should know why there are problems outside.

513
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:44,795
This is very simple to understand if you become divine.

514
00:51:44,996 --> 00:51:49,338
This divine light can give you all the understanding of everything.

515
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:53,781
I don't know, I've spoken about it so many times

516
00:51:53,982 --> 00:51:56,458
but never relating to beauty as such.

517
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:58,426
But

518
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:03,705
beauty is of course, is within, you know?

519
00:52:04,298 --> 00:52:06,429
It's all within, it's not without.

520
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,670
But that I cannot convince you like this

521
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:10,781
unless until you get your Realization.

522
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:14,252
There's some people who may be very beautiful outside

523
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:18,178
but inside would be like snakes. This can be.

524
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:21,178
So best thing is to have the beauty within.

525
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:23,097
That attracts the people.

526
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:27,818
See Me, I have so many disciples, now are so many all over the world.

527
00:52:28,218 --> 00:52:30,908
But now what do I do to them? Nothing. I just connect them

528
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,281
to the Divine as through this.

529
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:37,360
And there are 1000 petals inside your brain,

530
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:41,458
which gets enlightened and you become one with the Divine,

531
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:44,005
and the divine power starts flowing through you.

532
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:49,153
You become divine. Then you know what to wear,

533
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:53,618
how to behave, everything automatic. It is spontaneous.

534
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:57,377
I don't have to tell you, "Do this" or "Do that", nothing.

535
00:52:57,578 --> 00:53:00,138
It just works out. You are your own master.

536
00:53:00,338 --> 00:53:01,738
I don't have to tell you anything.

537
00:53:01,939 --> 00:53:05,337
You can find out what is good for you, what is bad for you.

538
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:07,898
This is not only for longevity I am saying,

539
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:11,417
but I am saying for the global peace.

540
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:14,618
You want to have it spread to

541
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:18,257
people through your endeavors, through your

542
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:22,805
different ideas and creativity, to all the people of the world.

543
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:25,738
So the problems that are created by human beings -

544
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:29,258
mainly they are the problems. And they can be solved.

545
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,343
If a human being becomes so beautiful inside,

546
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,472
then outside also he looks beautiful,

547
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:40,895
and also he can  create a very beautiful

548
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:43,097
loving world.

549
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:46,862
So, I would say you can ask Me some questions.

550
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,856
Eric? Come here.

551
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:55,449
Q: Are you happy with the [unclear] people

552
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,322
who'd come to the Albert Hall this year?

553
00:53:57,546 --> 00:54:00,306
SM: Eric, you come here. It's all right.

554
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:02,611
SY - Shri Mataji, were you happy with the people

555
00:54:02,812 --> 00:54:04,362
who came to the Albert Hall this year?

556
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,388
SM: Of course, why not?

557
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:09,722
I was very, very happy. Was very happy.

558
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:13,652
I'm always happy otherwise.

559
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,577
Whether they come or don't come makes no difference to Me.

560
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:23,927
Q: How do you realize? How do you, how do you realize this ?

561
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:26,761
SM: I was born like this.

562
00:54:27,672 --> 00:54:29,622
I see, how do you realize that you are a human being?

563
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:33,218
Q: No that you, you are accepting...

564
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:36,097
How do you realize that you are accepting

565
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:38,778
the change, the transition within yourself?

566
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:40,978
How do you know that it's happening to you?

567
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:43,539
SY: Is "you", you or Shri Mataji?

568
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,177
Q: How does one realize?

569
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:47,711
SY: How do we know when we're self realized?

570
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:50,777
SM: Ah, that's a good question.

571
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:53,778
That you know when you have in your hands

572
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,925
a cool or a hot breeze coming out.

573
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,497
Hot breeze is there because

574
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:01,085
if you have not forgiven, there won't be any.

575
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,337
But if you put your hands like this,

576
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:07,758
you should get cool breeze blowing into you.

577
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,338
What is this cool breeze?

578
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:12,688
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. That you can feel.

579
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:16,790
And also it comes out of your fontanel bone area. Yours it is,

580
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,418
not mine, yours, and you can feel it.

581
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:21,464
This is the first sign.

582
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:26,017
Then you start seeing the miracles you can do with your hand.

583
00:55:26,218 --> 00:55:28,257
For hair dress also I should say,

584
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,549
that if there is one realized lady,

585
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,027
she will exactly know how to make the hair -

586
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:38,082
because you become extremely creative.

587
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:40,937
And not that you stick to one style,

588
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:45,446
or you copy somebody, but you have your own style.

589
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:50,763
In everything you have your own style.

590
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,341
SY: The only way is to experience it, then you know,

591
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,898
so you may stay and ask Her to show you in a while.

592
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,938
Then you can feel it.

593
00:56:10,538 --> 00:56:12,937
The best way is to feel it yourself Shri Mataji,

594
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:15,657
then you don't have to describe it, you just know it.

595
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:21,996
SM: Self esteem and it's not overpowering, it's within yourself.

596
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:26,978
Such peace and such joy - within yourself. It's not overpowering.

597
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:32,787
On the contrary, it is so much spreading, so much

598
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:38,018
capturing other people, on a very higher level.

599
00:56:40,242 --> 00:56:43,418
Not on a mundane level, or on a very

600
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:46,377
low levels as people try to do.

601
00:56:46,578 --> 00:56:50,937
It's very, very divine

602
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:55,349
and extremely beautiful, I tell you.

603
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:01,570
Ask the question!

604
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:07,888
Have I answered all of your questions?
M: To my questions.

605
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:09,780
Q: What he said?

606
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:12,577
SY: Are there any other questions?

607
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:14,577
SY: Mother, could the ladies and

608
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:17,850
the people here tonight experience Self Realization?

609
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:22,007
SY: Can, can they experience it? Can You show us?

610
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:24,858
Should I try? All right. Then it's good.

611
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:27,075
It's very good.

612
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:31,135
And you will really become real professionals.

613
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:35,737
As I know, Mr. Emro has been so kind

614
00:57:35,938 --> 00:57:39,338
to announce it, but there are so many who have got all this

615
00:57:39,578 --> 00:57:43,689
but they are shy and they came quiet.

616
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,058
And they don't want to share it also,

617
00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:49,117
because they think that people think they are mad,

618
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:51,218
there's something wrong with them.

619
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:55,058
So it's very simple. It's very simple. You all can get it.

620
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,217
Should be take out our shoes?

621
00:57:57,418 --> 00:58:00,297
SY: It's best to take for meditation and to feel

622
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:02,107
those energies inside.

623
00:58:02,308 --> 00:58:04,343
It's best to take the shoes off so that you can

624
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:08,017
get a good grounding on the, on the earth, on the floor.

625
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,257
Q: Our socks as well?

626
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:11,589
SY: Whichever you feel. If you feel more relaxed,

627
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,377
take your socks [as well].

628
00:58:13,578 --> 00:58:16,458
SM: The socks you can have, but... it's o.k.

629
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:19,618
SY: Whatever you feel.

630
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,335
SM: I'm very happy there are so many ladies.

631
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,857
Because, you now, the women are very powerful.

632
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:33,058
They are very powerful - they don't know their powers.

633
00:58:37,468 --> 00:58:42,124
Of course. Now put both the feet on the ground, like this,

634
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:45,564
little away from each other,

635
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:51,467
and just put your both hands towards Me.

636
00:58:51,668 --> 00:58:53,937
[I must tell you], this is your right to have it.

637
00:58:54,138 --> 00:58:56,253
There's no obligation, nothing.

638
00:58:56,454 --> 00:59:00,017
It's your right to have it and you can all get it. No problems.

639
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:02,834
You can get it in no time.

640
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,884
As I've told you, you have to forgive everyone.

641
00:59:24,085 --> 00:59:27,669
Forgive everything, because that was past and finished.

642
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,262
We have to be in the present.

643
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:33,337
So, forgive everyone,

644
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,772
and also forgive yourself.

645
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:38,698
You shouldn't feel guilty about anything,

646
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:40,782
you should not be guilty about anything.

647
00:59:40,983 --> 00:59:44,938
Just forgive everyone, that's very important.

648
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:47,257
For you to have the experience

649
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:51,071
it's important that you forgive.

650
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:57,098
If you don't forgive, then you will feel hot breeze coming in.

651
00:59:57,338 --> 01:00:01,049
But If you forgive yourself and others,

652
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:05,291
there will be nice cool breeze blowing in your hands.

653
01:00:11,898 --> 01:00:15,995
Now, just put your right hand towards Me, and see

654
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:21,177
with your left hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

655
01:00:21,378 --> 01:00:23,657
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

656
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:27,057
You can bend your head. And see for yourself,

657
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:32,282
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming through.

658
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:45,252
You can see it - maybe on the sides might be,

659
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:48,938
but don't put it on top of the head, but above the head.

660
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:52,417
You just move your hand little bit here and there,

661
01:00:52,618 --> 01:00:55,893
and just put your right hand towards Me.

662
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,698
If it is hot that means you have not forgiven

663
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:05,457
yourself, or you have not forgiven others.

664
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:09,621
So, now put your left hand towards Me

665
01:01:12,954 --> 01:01:16,279
and put your right hand on top of your head.

666
01:01:16,913 --> 01:01:19,801
Again, just see.

667
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:23,897
Do not doubt yourself. Please don't doubt, have faith in yourself.

668
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:27,928
Now it will rise, it will rise.

669
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,096
Once more. Put your right hand towards Me,

670
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:39,977
and put your left hand towards Me and see for yourself.

671
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:53,878
Bend your head and close your eyes.

672
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,870
Please close your eyes.

673
01:02:04,218 --> 01:02:10,342
That's all. Now, just put your hands like this,

674
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:16,978
and those who have felt cool breeze or a hot breeze,

675
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:21,646
on these fingertips, or on the palm,

676
01:02:21,894 --> 01:02:25,879
or out of the fontanel bone, raise your hands.

677
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,988
Oh, not yet? Yes, it will work out. B: What's that?

678
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:36,706
Lady: I feel cool on my head and also my hands.

679
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,505
SM: Hand you felt, not here?
SY: Cool on the head, Shri Mataji. She feels cool.

680
01:02:39,706 --> 01:02:43,338
SM: Then it's alright because your this center is little bit in trouble.

681
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:45,193
It will be alright.

682
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,107
If you have felt it on your head it's alright, we will work it out.

683
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:50,537
What about you?
Lady: Hot.

684
01:02:51,138 --> 01:02:54,530
SM: What is she saying?
SY: It's hot? Is it blowing hot?

685
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:55,731
Lady: The hot.
SY: It's hot.

686
01:02:55,932 --> 01:02:58,017
SM: In the hands? Hot.

687
01:02:58,218 --> 01:03:01,138
SM: Alright, so please forgive. Please forgive.

688
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:03,537
You see, now see, logic is like this.

689
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,303
Wether you forgive, you don't forgive, what do you do?

690
01:03:06,504 --> 01:03:08,097
Nothing.

691
01:03:08,298 --> 01:03:11,153
By not forgiving you're torturing yourself.

692
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,300
See the point?

693
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:16,218
Now, so you please forgive Me, really forgive.

694
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,440
Put your hands towards Me.

695
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:23,064
Now cooler?
Lady: No.

696
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:24,739
SM: Not yet?

697
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:31,190
I'll have to work on you.

698
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,418
I have to work for your forgiveness.

699
01:03:35,618 --> 01:03:38,865
Anyone there? They all have felt it?

700
01:03:41,879 --> 01:03:45,298
Alright. So, come along.

701
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:49,042
SY: Remove the chair with you.

702
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:52,617
SM: Sit.
Lady: Where should I sit? here?

703
01:03:52,818 --> 01:03:55,578
SM: Can you sit?
Lady: I can sit...

704
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:00,377
SM: Put your right hand towards Me.
Lady: Alright.

705
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,612
Left hand on the earth.

706
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:05,718
SY: On the earth.
SM: Now forgive.

707
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:13,855
Liver. You have a liver problem.

708
01:04:14,056 --> 01:04:16,469
Lady: I do?
SM: Little bit.

709
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:19,566
You think too much.
Lady: I work too hard.

710
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:22,318
SM: Are you futuristic?

711
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:24,169
Are you futuristic?
Lady: What?

712
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:27,131
SY: Planing, planing, getting worked up a lot.

713
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:30,130
Lady: No, I live, I live with lot of [unclear] who think of the past

714
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:33,258
but I'm not futuristic.

715
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:35,655
SY: Not futuristic.

716
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:41,698
SM: Forgive, please forgive.

717
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,817
Lady: It's hard.

718
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:46,498
SY: Say it, say that, that "I forgive everybody" - just say it.

719
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,686
Lady: I don't know if I am ready.

720
01:04:50,898 --> 01:04:52,817
SY: Please say it. Then you've done it. It's easy.

721
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:56,298
SY: But Chris she's not ready yet. Not ready yet.

722
01:04:56,578 --> 01:04:59,419
SM: You are all ready. Now don't have this diffidence within you.

723
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,561
Otherwise you would not have come here. Alright?

724
01:05:03,762 --> 01:05:05,362
Lady: Okay, I'll forgive...

725
01:05:05,563 --> 01:05:07,845
SM: You are all ready. Come along, have it.

726
01:05:08,076 --> 01:05:09,310
Lady: Come on,  I forgive.

727
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,311
SM: Forgive, good. Very good idea.

728
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,563
It's cooler?

729
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:19,000
Lady: It's still hot, it's still hot!

730
01:05:19,201 --> 01:05:21,612
SM: We know...

731
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:26,741
SY: Keep say, "I'll forgive everybody" - you'll enjoy it.

732
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:30,232
SY: Say that inside, inside. SY: Yeah, inside.

733
01:05:30,837 --> 01:05:33,284
SM: It's still. Liver?

734
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:41,897
SM: Better now?
L: It's cool, yeah, it's cooler.

735
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:44,557
Not so hot, not so hot.

736
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:46,310
SM: It's an experience, it's not just

737
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:50,177
telling you, it's an experience. It's the truth.

738
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:52,681
Now she's feeling.

739
01:05:54,313 --> 01:05:56,017
Better now, much better.

740
01:05:56,225 --> 01:05:58,815
Lady: I see, yeah, not so hot, yeah, not so hot.

741
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:02,249
SM: Good.

742
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:13,967
Much better. You come along.

743
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:18,978
You felt it in the head. Not in the hands.

744
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:22,573
Can you face that side?

745
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,057
Lady: This side?

746
01:06:24,258 --> 01:06:26,578
SY: Towards her.
L: Towards her?

747
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:30,504
SY: Like that? Move back. On the Vishuddhi.

748
01:06:33,734 --> 01:06:36,778
SM: Does she sing or?
SY: Do you sing?

749
01:06:36,979 --> 01:06:38,572
L: Yeah.

750
01:06:40,966 --> 01:06:44,357
SM: Come back, yes, come back, please. I'll give vibrations on Vishuddhi.

751
01:06:51,058 --> 01:06:55,178
She may develop spondylitis? Very bad.

752
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:10,692
Don't feel guilty.

753
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,957
Do you feel guilty?

754
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,503
SM: Are you a catholic?
L: No...

755
01:07:20,892 --> 01:07:22,614
SM: Then you should not feel.

756
01:07:29,538 --> 01:07:32,538
What work do you do?
SY: What work?

757
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:35,910
L: What work do I do?

758
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:38,417
SY: She runs my desk.

759
01:07:38,618 --> 01:07:41,457
SY: She's at his desk. SY: Receptionist.

760
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:44,818
SY: Reception, yes.
SM: She's at the desk.

761
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:48,527
SY: Busy

762
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:09,265
SM: Now, are you feeling in your hands - just see.

763
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:11,738
SY: Put your hands up and tell Her.

764
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:17,496
SM: Turn now.

765
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:54,338
Now, feel?

766
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:56,818
Little bit? Alright.

767
01:08:59,738 --> 01:09:02,138
May God bless you.

768
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:12,967
Any other questions?

769
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,822
Have I answered all your questions?

770
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:36,427
So now, you will have to understand how to meditate.

771
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:39,297
That's all. And if you understand that,

772
01:09:39,498 --> 01:09:42,232
you'll grow, grow very fast.

773
01:09:42,433 --> 01:09:45,297
I'm sure you will grow and then you'll be amazed at your

774
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:46,978
[unclear].

775
01:09:47,258 --> 01:09:49,138
Because you will not feel disturbed.

776
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:53,378
There will be no stress, strain again. Very happy you will be.

777
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:57,978
Because what's the use of getting into stress?

778
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:02,086
You cannot solve it, the problem you cannot solve.

779
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:08,977
You can only solve the problem by solving yourself.

780
01:10:09,178 --> 01:10:12,377
Because the problem is with you, not without.

781
01:10:12,578 --> 01:10:14,418
If you think like that, it's alright.

782
01:10:14,618 --> 01:10:17,418
And you all can feel very much better.

783
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:22,307
You will sleep better, and you'll enjoy life much better.

784
01:10:22,508 --> 01:10:25,097
So, I would like to invite you all to India also,

785
01:10:25,298 --> 01:10:26,818
if possible, please come.

786
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:30,018
We have a very good session there, we have the seashore

787
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:34,177
and enjoy yourself. She has been to one of the

788
01:10:34,378 --> 01:10:37,377
Institutions of Sahaja Yoga for Music.

789
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:41,321
And see how she has picked up! I was amazed the way she was playing.

790
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:44,191
It's a very great thing.

791
01:10:44,398 --> 01:10:47,538
Indian music is not easy, you can't learn that easy.

792
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:50,657
But I was surprised, in three months,

793
01:10:50,858 --> 01:10:52,750
the boys were singing [bhajans]

794
01:10:52,951 --> 01:10:54,777
I said, "How did you [unclear]"...

795
01:10:54,978 --> 01:10:57,615
Imagine, in three, three...

796
01:10:57,816 --> 01:11:01,218
months only. I mean, you take years together to learn.

797
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:04,189
So many things happened in...

798
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,025
Because they have become realized souls,

799
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:10,080
and they can pick up things very fast.

800
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:13,097
I was amazed, really, how they have picked up.

801
01:11:13,298 --> 01:11:14,818
She has picked up tabla very...

802
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:17,899
in India also you wouldn't find any woman who can play at tabla.

803
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:21,125
It's really remarkable.

804
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,332
Remarkable things happened.

805
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,898
And you yourself will become remarkable, yourself.

806
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:33,977
Alright, thank you very much. Thank you, may God bless you.

807
01:11:34,178 --> 01:11:36,178
So you can take help from Emro,

808
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:39,337
he can help you I think in giving Realization.

809
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:42,697
It's a very good thing you have done - I'm really thankful to you.

810
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:46,097
Because I wanted to talk to ladies first

811
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:49,711
because they don't know how powerful they are.

812
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:56,079
Catherine!

813
01:11:56,829 --> 01:12:00,033
SY: So now, if anybody wants to know more about Sahaja Yoga

814
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:03,258
or Self Realization

815
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:06,058
there's a lot...

816
01:12:06,858 --> 01:12:09,378
SY: He's now got information there, if anybody wants

817
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:11,879
to know a bit more about Sahaja Yoga

818
01:12:12,185 --> 01:12:14,785
SM: It's really great, I must say.

819
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:18,058
SY: So we should do some sessions here also.

820
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,075
SM: Also there was, one actor who came to see Me,

821
01:12:21,276 --> 01:12:22,625
he had a problema,

822
01:12:22,826 --> 01:12:26,458
I don't know where he is lost.
SY: Pardon? The actor?

823
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:29,578
SM: Some actor.
SY: The actor

824
01:12:32,584 --> 01:12:35,425
SM: He knows him.

825
01:12:37,164 --> 01:12:40,098
You should try to get some actors and actresses, you see.

826
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:44,337
It will be a good idea. Because they're all suffering and

827
01:12:44,538 --> 01:12:46,842
actually they die very fast.

828
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,898
SY: Thank you very much. Thank you.
