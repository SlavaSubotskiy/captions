1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,090
…only thing to do is to come down as a human
being, to live like a human being, and suffer

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,180
like a human being.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,820
And He came down on this earth, to know now,
to know the world that He has created, from

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,820
inside, out.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,310
That’s how He came just to save us.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,980
But I mean, he was talking and his Agnya was
such a big catch that I was just saying ki

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,140
(that) thing he is talking about itself is
evident in him – that there is no sense

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,880
of humility left in him!

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
The way he was using Christ for that!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,050
And a very horrible Agnya!

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,050
And I cleared it out.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,990
And the whole thing was like a…I was thinking
he was putting up an act.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:49,170
And then the most miserable part was later
on when he said that, “What is your message

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,559
for the people of other communities who are
here and what do you say?”

15
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,379
He said that, “We should love our neighbour
and that’s how we must love you.

16
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,340
And it’s for the wellbeing, and that’s
why we had started a thing by which we give

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,280
people jobs and look after them."

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,540
And the thing all started with a philanthropic
thing, and then it became a union, a labour

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,359
union, and then he became a social worker,
and ultimately he ended up with an employment

20
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:27,529
exchange!! (laughing) And I didn’t know
what sort of a bishop is he and when is he

21
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:28,950
going to talk about the emancipation of the
Spirit within?

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,670
When is he going to talk about the evolution?

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,159
And when is he going to talk that we have
to be aware of ourselves?

24
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,459
And – nothing!

25
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,509
Not a word!

26
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,810
What he spoke was this, and so disappointing,
I tell you.

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,159
I mean, all the way Christ came only just
to give you jobs?

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,249
(laughing) And then they had a man put up
there who talked about how they give jobs

29
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,789
to people who don’t have jobs and how they
create jobs.

30
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,170
So the whole thing became an economic activity!

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,740
So, [to] understand God and His humility by
saying that He should come all the way on

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,049
this earth just to give us employment exchange!

33
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,200
I mean this is how if you are going to judge
God’s incarnation, I don’t know what you

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,479
are going to get out of them.

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,440
Because this is a wrong conception you have
about God and His ways.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Absolutely.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,540
And people listen to him, I mean without any
questioning or anything because he was a bishop

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,080
elected by all of you, and he was on and on
and on.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,549
So this is, one has to understand, why did
Christ come on this earth?

40
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,349
Why did He come all the way with all humility?

41
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,700
Why did He come as a poor man on this earth?

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:50,109
And why did He, at all, wanted to get crucified
and to sacrifice His life for the people who

43
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:51,780
were supposed to be sinners?

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,340
This is what we should find out.

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,940
Not for unemployment or for getting you a
material gain because He Himself has said

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,159
that, “A rich man can never enter into the
Kingdom of God."

47
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:10,170
So to get jobs for people or to get them some…there
was a disabled person, and “a disabled person

48
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,660
should be helped, and that is the job of the
Church."

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,940
And that’s what they were describing, that
how they were helping the disabled people

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,170
in this country!!

51
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,099
So, because He cured certain people that doesn’t
mean that He came to look after the disabled

52
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,650
hospitals and things like that!

53
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,209
But He came on this earth for a new awareness
being shot into our being.

54
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:42,650
He was born at a time when human beings had
no idea as to what is the eternal life, what

55
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,109
is the Spirit, what we call the ‘Atma’
is.

56
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,150
They never even thought that there is something
like that.

57
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,180
He was born in a place where they did not
think on those lines.

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,060
And though in India, we can say that people
have been thinking about Atma and Paramatma

59
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,349
since long; but they also achieved nothing
because all these so-called religious leaders

60
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,540
of India were busy collecting money.

61
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,459
Then Christ came in, you see.

62
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,419
And they were – I don’t know what sort
of temples they had or what sort of pujas

63
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,220
they used to have, or what ideas they had
about God because He came out two thousand

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
years ago.

65
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,830
And that same time Buddhism also was spreading
in India.

66
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,669
And all these things, if you see in the collectively,
it is very disturbing to see people using

67
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:37,889
Buddha in that fashion.

68
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,990
And it was necessary that Christ should come
on this earth to tell them that it is the

69
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,802
Spirit that you have to find out.

70
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:48,130
You don’t have to worry about other things,
but it is the Spirit which is to be reborn.

71
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,130
You are to be reborn.

72
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,780
You are to be Christian.

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,560
And that’s how we came on this earth.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,630
But He could not cross the limit of Bethlehem.

75
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:04,550
I mean, He was just, we can say of – absolutely
gated into that place because of the ignorance

76
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,550
of the people.

77
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,670
His message never spread out when He lived.

78
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,440
So His purpose was to come on this earth,
on the Agnya chakra, as you know that, to

79
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:22,639
open it, and to give a new dimension to our
awareness by which we try to understand what

80
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,979
Krishna had said that, “Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavaka."

81
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:33,639
Krishna had said that, “The Spirit cannot
be destroyed, it cannot be killed, it cannot

82
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,199
be wiped out, it cannot be blown off."

83
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,720
“Na chainam kledayantyapo, na shosayati
marutaha."

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,129
“It cannot be sucked in by any air."

85
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,530
And when Krishna said that people said, “What
sort of a Spirit is that?

86
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,530
Where is that Atma?

87
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,560
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,879
Which one it is?”

89
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,169
So Christ came on this earth because He is
the essence.

90
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,730
And He showed by His resurrection that Spirit
does not die.

91
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,000
And He showed it very clearly what Krishna
had said, because, you know, He was Krishna’s

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,349
son, and that’s how He did it.

93
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:09,759
But before He could deliver the complete thing
to human beings they crucified Him.

94
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,639
And that is the way they respected Him and
that is the way they came to Him.

95
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,289
Now in Sahaja Yoga also, we must know that
if you go to Sahaja Yoga, it is not [that]

96
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,120
you are obliging Sahaja Yoga.

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,690
You see, this is how a person talks today
when Christ is no more.

98
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,449
That, “Christ came on this earth, it was
His humility,” because you understand how

99
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:29,449
great He was.

100
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,590
I mean, at least, you try to pose that you
understand, then you say like that.

101
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,180
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you think
the Sahaja Yoga should oblige you and not

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,760
you are being under the obligation of Sahaja
Yoga.

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,290
[Part 2]

104
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,770
…conditions about your spirituality through
completely humbling down yourself because

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,319
it is the grace of God that must be sought
for.

106
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,419
And somebody’s grace you cannot force it
down.

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,419
You cannot demand it.

108
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,800
You cannot ask for it.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,820
You cannot say that, “I am such and such
a big king”, and something like that, “so

110
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,060
the grace should come to me."

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,729
No, it may not come to you at all.

112
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:15,240
Even you may be the highest priest of the
Church of England, you may not get the grace

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
of God.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
To get the grace of God you have to ask for
it, you have to be humble.

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,210
It is like we expect to go to the king’s
palace and then we want that the king should

116
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,910
come forward, he should kneel down, and he
should take you by hand and make you sit on

117
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,500
the throne!

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,030
I mean, this is something absurd!

119
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,759
We can understand that.

120
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,259
But even more than that is an incarnation.

121
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:48,500
An incarnation comes down in complete humility,
not to be humiliated, but to make you understand

122
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:57,360
that an incarnation has come all the way for
your emancipation and for your spiritual growth.

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,759
Then you should with great surrendering and
great humility should accept it.

124
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,729
But the general attitude, you have seen how
Sahaja Yogis before coming and after coming,

125
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,500
how they realise how others are behaving towards
Sahaja Yoga.

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,259
They have no humility about it.

127
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,469
They are thinking, “Oh, we’ll come and
judge Mataji.

128
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:15,490
We’ll see how she is.

129
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,310
We’ll watch her and we’ll do this, or
we’ll come and see the Sahaja Yogis are

130
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
like this."

131
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,750
They never come with the idea that they have
to receive it out of their own humility, because

132
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,840
they have asked for it, that’s why they
are going to have it.

133
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,130
On the contrary, they behave so funnily.

134
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,950
Despite that, they get it.

135
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,130
Despite that, they get their Realisation.

136
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,510
Despite that, they get everything else.

137
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,920
But one should know that, somehow or other
you should try to tell those who come, now

138
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,090
you’ll be coming down here, you see I’ll
be not here, and they’ll be coming to see

139
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,700
you, many people know about your address,
then you should tell them that, “We have

140
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,140
to realise [that] if we have to get something
then there should be an area created within

141
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,870
us through our humility."

142
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,580
Like if you throw a stone into the Ganges
you do not get any water out of it.

143
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,150
But if you are a pitcher, if there is an area
which can take that water in then only can

144
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,150
you fill in the Ganges.

145
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,620
Now, if you go to the Ganges and tell Her,
abuse Her and say, “Oh, you Ganges, come

146
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,490
along to my house!”

147
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,260
Will She come to your house?

148
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,400
In the same way one has to understand an incarnation
or a blessing of God, or a grace of God.

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,590
We have to ask for it and humble down for
it.

150
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,100
They have all the rituals.

151
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,280
For example – if you go to the church, they’ll
say, “Kneel down” and even the priest

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,860
would say, kneel down before him.

153
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,910
Though he may not be a realised soul or anything,
this bishop of Canterbury or somebody who

154
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,290
spoke today, he is not a realised soul, his
Kundalini is just frozen.

155
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,510
But the way everybody was very humbled down
before him.

156
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,010
He never deserved it, according to Me, he
never deserves it, but we’ll do that.

157
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,700
But to an incarnation not only that you are
not humble to Him, but we are extremely insulting,

158
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
humiliating and we crucify.

159
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,250
We have to see that human nature.

160
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:16,420
It is such a terrible thing to do and if this
is done often then the wrath of God has to

161
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:25,060
come, we cannot stop it because the way we
are behaving, and the way we are looking at

162
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
it.

163
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,160
Now, think of Christ, how He was created,
as you have seen in the Devi Mahatmyam, the

164
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,190
Mahavishnu stage, how He was created specially
in the heaven, and then how He was brought

165
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,190
in.

166
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,010
You have read it in the Devi Mahatmyam, His
creation.

167
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,240
With all those things which are being done
to Him, all the powers that were given to

168
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,660
Him, and was specially asked to come on this
earth, to live like a ordinary human being.

169
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:57,860
Say, if you tell a king to go and live in
a shack, or you can say in a place which is

170
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:06,540
not meant for even human existence, in such
places, if you ask a king to go and live,

171
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,130
it will be very difficult.

172
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,560
But they do it, they have done it.

173
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,940
And when they come here, the attitude of the
people should be completely surrendering;

174
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,940
to thank God that you have done this for us.

175
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Thankfulness.

176
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,340
And the thankfulness is the way to joy, there
is no other way.

177
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,820
We get everything but we never thank.

178
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,390
Grudging type we are.

179
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,710
Today is the day of thankfulness that He sent
His only son, as we say, and he came himself

180
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,560
so many times on this earth, and how we have
been helped by his coming here, his aspect

181
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,210
coming down on this earth.

182
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,500
The thankfulness if you do not have, you’ll
never see the joy that you have – whatever

183
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,280
you have got, whatever God has given you out
of His grace, out of His compassion, out of

184
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,460
His love.

185
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,160
There is not even a second, which you can
spare, but thank Him all the time.

186
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,330
It’s only thankfulness.

187
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,140
And when you thank Him, the waves of joy will
rise within you.

188
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,470
Because we do not know how to thank Him for
what we have got it.

189
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,960
There is no joy within us and we are joyless
people, we are very unhappy.

190
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,370
Whatever we have, we are not happy about it.

191
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,510
So, this is the point is that, Have we thanked
Him?

192
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,400
Have we thanked Him every moment of our lives,
whatever He has given us?

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,511
It’s a great thing, the greatest thing,
is that He has given us Realisation, and He

194
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:44,910
has given us the way of Sahaja by which we
can now find out ourselves fully.

195
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,310
And the another thing is, unless and until
that is done, we cannot perfect anything in

196
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,150
this world, nothing can be perfected.

197
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,530
All your institutions, all your endeavours
are going to be imperfect.

198
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:01,230
A human being has to be perfected and he has
to get cured and, for that, the only simple

199
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,840
thing is to humble down.

200
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,820
Humbling down is the only way you can get
it.

201
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,840
There is no way of arguing about it, there
is no way of talking about it, or imposing

202
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,380
on anyone – nothing of the kind – but
how much you are humbled down within yourself

203
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
is the point.

204
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,010
Always look into your heart, humble down,
humble down, and humble down.

205
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,060
And thank, every moment, every minute.

206
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,740
And that is the key to spark the joy out of
every moment.

207
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,780
Every moment has an ocean of joy in it but
to spark it you must thank for whatever you

208
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,780
have got.

209
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,180
But if you are a grudging type, all the time
if you think that, “Oh, I haven’t got

210
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,020
this, I haven’t got this, I haven’t got
that,” then you can never enjoy whatever

211
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
you have.

212
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,860
And that is what is the message for Christmas
for everyone: is that Christmas is a day of

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,720
thankfulness because He gave His only son
to you and He came as an extremely humble

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,990
person, in a very humble abode, in a very
humble birth.

215
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:10,740
And that is a thing one has to know, that
we have to be thankful for what we have got,

216
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,580
materially, physically, emotionally, and mentally
also whatever we have learnt.

217
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,490
While He lived in complete poverty, with complete
thankfulness within him.

218
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,920
So may God bless you!

219
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,290
I am very much thankful for this house, that
my children have got it.

220
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,690
I am very much thankful that my children are
all here and they are enjoying.

221
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,100
I am very much thankful that I am with them
and that your problems are solved.

222
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:46,120
I don’t know how to thank for all this,
your love that you have shown, and all the

223
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,120
beautiful things you have been thinking and
singing, and how you have taken to Sahaja

224
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,700
Yoga and working for it.

225
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,590
There is no end to it!

226
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,230
But you also enjoy it by thanking all the
time.

227
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,590
May God bless you!
