1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,160
Today, we have gathered here

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,630
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,370
The One, which is reflected within us, is the Shiva -

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,550
which is the pure Spirit.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,070
This pure Spirit within us is the reflection

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,230
of God Almighty - Sadashiva.

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,690
It's like the sun that falls

8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:04,490
in the water and gives a clear reflection,

9
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,850
or else it falls on the stone -

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,370
it doesn't give any reflection at all.

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,390
If you have, say, the mirror,

12
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,740
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,240
but will reflect back its light.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,500
In the same way in the human beings

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,130
the reflection of God Almighty

16
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:47,380
is expressed in the way your personality is.

17
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,400
If your personality is clean and clear, innocent,

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,850
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,690
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God Almighty

20
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:12,750
in the proper manner, in the sense

21
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,330
that their own identification with wrong things is no more.

22
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,580
When there is no such identification

23
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,410
and when a person is absolutely the pure Spirit,

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,760
then the reflection of God reflects into others.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Luckily you all have got your Self Realization.

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,320
That means the reflection of God Almighty

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,940
is already working into your attention.

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:04,530
The attention is enlightened by the power of the Spirit.

29
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,840
The power of the Spirit is that it is a reflection.

30
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,840
That means the reflection is never

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:26,870
identified with the mirror or with the water.

32
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,300
It is there till the sun shines,

33
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,790
and when there is no sun there is no reflection.

34
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:48,880
So, when you are in Sahaja Yoga,

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,800
you have cleansed out yourself.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,670
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

37
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,170
and now you are pure personalities.

38
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,590
That's why this reflection is clearer and clearer,

39
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,530
and people see it - see it on your face,

40
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,860
they see it in your body, they see it in your work,

41
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,220
in your behavior, in everywhere.

42
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,440
It is difficult for people to really believe in themselves,

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,590
that they could be the reflection of God Almighty.

44
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,460
They have some sort of a complexes about themselves,

45
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,600
I think, that they cannot understand
how they have suddenly become

46
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,020
the reflection of God Almighty.

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,980
But they have a capacity

48
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,920
and they can become the reflection of God Almighty,

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,680
for which they have to have faith in themselves,

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,310
faith in their ascent - to believe that “we have become that”.

51
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,370
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

52
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,810
Without the full confidence, you cannot achieve your ascent -

53
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,630
that you have seen. Even in My lectures I have to tell them

54
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,780
that we have to have full self-confidence.

55
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,250
But confidence doesn't mean, by any chance,

56
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,950
your ego, your aggressiveness.

57
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,980
If you are confident, you are least aggressive.

58
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,330
There is a story, a Chinese story, very interesting one,

59
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,190
that one king wanted his cocks to win in the

60
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,900
race they have about the cock fighting.

61
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,930
So somebody said that there is a saint,

62
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:16,060
if you can take your cocks to him he'll make them so strong

63
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,060
that they will definitely win this race.

64
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,290
So he took his two cocks and gave it to the saint and he said,

65
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,350
“I want you to give them all the strength to fight this race”.

66
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,130
After one month, the king
came and took these two cocks

67
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,300
and put them in the arena where there were many other cocks also.

68
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:52,280
So the cocks started fighting and attacking these two cocks,

69
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,720
but these two cocks were just standing very patiently,

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,920
absolutely calm and quiet.

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,940
Any kind of attack

72
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,950
they were just looking at it as a fun,
Any kind of attack

73
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:07,960
Any kind of attack

74
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,300
and all the cocks got tired and they ran away from the arena,

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,420
and that's how these two cocks won the game.

76
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,240
This is what it is for us to understand,

77
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,870
that for a person who is detached, he can never be attacked.

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,830
We are attacked by so many identifications we have.

79
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:39,630
Firstly, our family, then our country, then our religion,

80
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,510
then all kinds of thing, racialism.

81
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080
All these identifications really make us weak,

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,740
because they attack us all the time

83
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,860
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

84
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,480
The reason is, you must have confidence in Sahaja Yoga

85
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,330
and confidence in yourself - that you are on the right path

86
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,770
and that you are now saved, and nobody can attack you

87
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,050
because you have the complete protection of the Divine.

88
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,580
People may follow any religion,

89
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,780
they may follow any guru, they may follow anything,
People may follow any religion,

90
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,720
they may follow any guru, they may follow anything,

91
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,860
but they have fear all the time that “we'll be attacked”,

92
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,240
and they're afraid to say things, which they should say.

93
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,640
They have no discretion even to know

94
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,790
what is to be said.
They have no discretion even to know

95
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:40,190
With the proper understanding that you are the pure Spirit,

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,700
if you believe in that then you'll be surprised that

97
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,140
you will be very confident about what you are doing.

98
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,330
In that way we can say

99
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,900
that we have also another great advantage -

100
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,960
is that we are in the collective.

101
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,540
We can find out in the collective how are we behaving.

102
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,860
What is the reaction in the collective?

103
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,140
In the collective it's a person who is very subtle,

104
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,060
he need not talk too much, he need not say much.

105
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,670
He could stand like the cocks I told you about,

106
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,250
but his depth can be felt.

107
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,800
You can feel a person of that caliber,

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,920
that he's such a deep person, that he doesn't want to aggress.

109
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,670
He feels protected within himself.

110
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,350
So this protection we have to feel,

111
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,320
not mentally but within ourselves,

112
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,760
and once you have that gravity,

113
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,020
that feeling, nobody can attack.

114
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,170
The attacking person himself is insecure,

115
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,200
or maybe he’s ill bred, maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,890
So you have to just have a kind of a

117
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,810
gracious view about the person.

118
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,100
Like Shiva was,

119
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,950
we should say Sadashiva's character is known, that

120
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,940
He is the one who used to forgive anyone.

121
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,270
Anybody who did penance like standing on their heads,

122
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,020
or standing on one foot, or not eating their food,

123
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,250
or all kinds of penances, He used to be so disgusted

124
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,020
that He would say, "Alright, what do you want? Take it."

125
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,120
And He also gave blessings to many rakshasas

126
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
as you have heard,

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
and so many rakshasas were blessed by Him

128
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,060
because He got fed up with their penances.

129
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,020
There were so many stories about Sadashiva

130
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:14,540
giving a blessing to people.

131
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,600
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting story about Ravana,

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,600
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don't know what he did,

133
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,320
how much he must have starved with his ten heads

134
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,220
and what…

135
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,500
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so hungry -

136
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,970
with ten mouths, you see.

137
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,200
I don't know what he must have done

138
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,190
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva just got fed up, you see.

139
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,450
His compassion is so great He thought,

140
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,150
‘Let this man have whatever he likes.’

141
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,990
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said: “What do you want?

142
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,360
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”

143
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,740
So he said that, ”I want to have a blessing.”

144
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,340
He said, ”What blessing?”

145
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,170
”First you promise that whatever I ask for, you will give me.”

146
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,360
He said, “Of course. If it is in my power, I'll give.”

147
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,760
It's a very interesting story.

148
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,750
So he said, ”I want to have your wife.”

149
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,900
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

150
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,310
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner with him,

151
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,880
he can do wonders. So he asked that

152
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:38,320
”I should get your wife as my partner.”

153
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,810
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for Him

154
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,430
to take such a decision to give him, to this devil,

155
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,490
but in compassion He did it. And all these events, you see,

156
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,310
really show that how His compassion works out things.

157
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:11,380
As a result, it was decided that the…

158
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,670
His wife Parvati had to go with this horrible fellow.

159
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:26,300
But Parvati's sister was Shri Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

160
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,550
and He said to Himself

161
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,430
that, "I can't allow my sister to go with this devil.

162
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,310
I must do something about it.”

163
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,690
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.

164
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,500
So, what He did was to

165
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,700
make him feel like going for the bathroom.

166
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,530
So he felt shy. He put the lady on one side

167
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,520
and he went to the bathroom.

168
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,570
Now, Shiva had warned him that,

169
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,500
"You'd better be careful, because this Mother Earth

170
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,300
is the mother of this lady,

171
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,580
and never put Her on the Mother Earth.

172
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,270
You must carry Him all the time on your back".

173
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,960
So when he reached a certain point,

174
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,450
Shri Krishna created a mischief and he felt like going.

175
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,690
So he put Her down. As soon as he put Her down,

176
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,510
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he didn't know what to do.

177
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,630
Second time again he tried.

178
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,760
And he again went to Shiva and he said,

179
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,080
"See now, this is what you have promised,

180
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,610
and this is what is doing".

181
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,750
So He said, "I had warned you that

182
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,730
Her brother is a very mischievous fellow

183
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,440
and He'll somehow or other manage,

184
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,590
so you'd better be careful. This time you don't listen to Him.

185
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,510
Don't put Her on the ground, whatever it may be".

186
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:10,060
So this time he did another try, we can say,

187
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,270
and carried Her on his back. Suddenly he found a little boy.

188
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,490
It was Shri Krishna Himself laughing at him.

189
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,080
He said, ”Why are you laughing at me?”

190
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,500
"Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman on your back?

191
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,380
She has no ornaments". He said, “She's the Goddess.”

192
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,840
He said: “No. She has no ornaments. She's wearing nothing.

193
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,650
How can She be the Goddess?”

194
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,900
So you see in India that's a ... proverb we use.

195
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,380
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives without any ornaments

196
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,720
or anything, that she's like the Lanka Parvati.

197
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,520
So he was carrying Her to Lanka.

198
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,510
And when he looked at Her up,

199
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,180
he saw a very old woman without any teeth, you know,

200
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,490
laughing at him. He got such a fright he threw Her away.

201
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,670
That's Mahamaya.

202
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,100
Then the third situation was, he went and told that,

203
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,040
"You better tell your wife that She's not to listen to anybody,

204
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,280
and you better see that you give me your wife itself".

205
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,050
He said, "Alright, She'll be born in Lanka and you can marry Her",

206
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,470
and Her name was Mandodari.

207
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,040
Now the great story goes on like that.

208
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,020
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper of Vishnu,

209
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,980
and at the time when Rama came, you see, to kill him -

210
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,670
all this was organized by Mandodari Herself.

211
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,770
Because She knew that if Shri Ram kills Ravana,

212
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,120
he will get his liberation from these ideas about women -

213
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,840
the way he was running after Sita

214
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,620
and doing all these things.
the way he was running after Sita

215
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:03,630
and doing all these things.

216
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,710
She actually wanted that something should happen that

217
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,810
he should take another birth, and he should get rid of these

218
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,470
notions of looking after beautiful women

219
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,450
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

220
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,520
She was against it completely, but he would not listen.

221
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,780
So the war took place, and in the war he was killed by Shri Rama.

222
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,300
All this episode came

223
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:45,860
because of the unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

224
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,860
His compassion is,

225
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,720
to look at, looks very illogical sometimes,

226
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,450
but there's a big logic behind it.

227
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,700
The logic is that whatever He does

228
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:09,910
brings forth a kind of a solution of the problem.

229
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,460
For example, there was a war on,

230
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,370
and the war was going on,

231
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,160
and that time there was a problem

232
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,290
because there was one horrible devil

233
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,990
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva.

234
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,660
That nobody can kill you.

235
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,030
He had given, also, blessings that they call ‘Vardaan’

236
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,080
to another saint, who said,

237
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,820
"I want to sleep now and nobody should disturb me".

238
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,360
So he was given a blessing -

239
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,310
anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

240
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,420
you can just look at that person and that will be…

241
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,860
he'll be reduced to ashes.

242
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,010
So these two now…

243
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,860
when the war started, you see, Shri Krishna thought,

244
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:15,800
best thing is to kill this devil with the same blessings

245
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,340
that the saint has got –

246
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,360
so He played.

247
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,860
And He started running away from the battlefield,

248
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:33,590
and that's why He's called as a

249
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:39,800
as a warrior who has ran out of the field – ‘Ranchordas’ -

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,220
the one who runs away out of the field of battle.

251
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,410
And when He was running, He was wearing a shawl - Shri Krishna.

252
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,680
He just stealthily entered into the cave

253
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,270
where this another saint was sleeping

254
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,410
and put His shawl on top of that.

255
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,880
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

256
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,780
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was following Him,

257
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,810
this satanic fellow, he reached that place .

258
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,540
and saw the same shawl

259
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,950
and he said, "Oh, so now you are tired

260
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,320
and now you are sleeping here. I'll put you right,"

261
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,300
without realizing who was sleeping.

262
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,720
And he pulled the shawl,

263
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,490
and here the sleeping saint gets up and looks at him,

264
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,240
and they say with his third eye he burnt (him).

265
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,690
So the solution came in

266
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,080
So the whole play is like this, of three forces going on,

267
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,230
just to show ultimately the truth prevails.

268
00:20:54,430 --> 00:21:01,490
First is the Shiva's compassion, His goodness, to one side.

269
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,970
Then the play of Shri Krishna, or say Shri Vishnu,

270
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,230
of neutralising it;

271
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:18,230
and the third is the play of

272
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,500
Brahma who creates things and who produces things.

273
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,190
All these three forces are playing,

274
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,230
just to create an atmosphere for all of us to feel that

275
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,240
there is something else is to be done to our human awareness.

276
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,210
All they have evolved within us this desire to seek the truth.

277
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,050
Now, on one side Shiva is extremely compassionate,

278
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,860
very kind even to Asuras, the rakshasas.

279
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,140
But on the other side He can be extremely cruel.

280
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,180
He can destroy the whole Universe.

281
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,080
If the people are so decadent,

282
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:19,160
if the people do not take to spirituality,

283
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,450
if their innocence is completely lost,

284
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,320
if they do not get detached from all these wrong identifications

285
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,710
which are creating problems in this world,

286
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,060
He destroys the whole Universe.

287
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,740
So, as it is, He is the spectator of the work of Adi Shakti.

288
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,700
He allows Her to do all this work, to create human beings,

289
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,950
to give them realization, do all this.

290
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,410
But in case He finds Her children,

291
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,490
people who have been saved by Her,

292
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,830
are misbehaving

293
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,190
or insulting or in any way destroying Her work,

294
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,430
He might get into a temper

295
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,250
by which He can destroy the whole Universe.

296
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,760
But I don't think now there's any chance for Him to do that,

297
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

298
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,390
But what I find among Sahaja Yogis is this,

299
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,920
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow very fast.

300
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:37,600
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their principle of Shiva Tatwa.

301
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,380
The first achievement shows that from inside

302
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,610
they start getting detached.

303
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,560
Now, detachment is not mental. It's not mental.

304
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,470
It is not that we have to take to some sort of a Sanyasa

305
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,030
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up our families and all that.

306
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,410
But the detachment is within oneself.

307
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,370
When that detachment starts working,

308
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,620
the first sign is that we become joyous.

309
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,240
We become happy.

310
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,190
Now if you ask anyone, "Why are you unhappy?”,

311
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:28,130
he'll talk about his wife, maybe his house, maybe his children,

312
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:35,510
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever it is.

313
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,870
So he gets absolutely upset,

314
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,950
or maybe very unhappy to see things happening around him.

315
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,970
Now [if] he is a realized soul -

316
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,620
this unhappiness is not going to help.

317
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,150
What is needed is, now,

318
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:05,970
to know that you can correct all these ills of the society,

319
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,700
of the family, of the whole country by transforming others,

320
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,590
not by feeling bad. But while doing that,

321
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:22,120
the main thing that you should have is a complete detachment.

322
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,380
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja Yoga

323
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,980
how people told Me about their own countrymen, country fellows.

324
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,680
I was amazed how they told Me about their own religions,

325
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,140
how wrong things they are doing.

326
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,110
I didn't know so much as they told Me,

327
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,880
and I thought that this is a detachment that has come

328
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,960
that they can see clearly what's wrong -

329
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:59,160
what's wrong with my society, with my people,

330
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,420
with my relations, with my family, with my country,

331
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,410
with the whole world.

332
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,710
But is only possible if you are not identified

333
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,990
to any one of them. Otherwise you will never see the defects.
But is only possible if you are not identified

334
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,000
to any one of them. Otherwise you will never see the defects.

335
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,270
You'll never see what's wrong with that person.

336
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,150
You can never even see the chakras which are catching.

337
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,630
So, the first thing that should happen is detachment.

338
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,080
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

339
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,790
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how do you get detached?”

340
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,450
Because I am not attached you see, so I'm already detached -

341
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,950
I don't know how to do that way.

342
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,380
But for you people I would say,

343
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,810
to understand yourself, you should introspect.

344
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,940
Try to find out to what thing am I attached.

345
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,980
Why am I miserable? For whom am I worried?

346
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,750
Why should I worry?
Why am I miserable? For whom am I worried?

347
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:00,760
Why am I miserable? For whom am I worried?

348
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,250
Some things, you see, which were never very important,

349
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,110
they become very important to certain Sahaja Yogis.

350
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:16,150
For example, I was told that in the West people don't care

351
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,040
so much for their children. But as soon as they get realization

352
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:28,920
they just get attached to their children like as if it's some glue.

353
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,110
They cannot think what is good for their children.

354
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:39,460
Everything about children they think is their primary duty.

355
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,400
The other day I was surprised when they told me that

356
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,020
it's the parents who want to come after the Birthday Puja.

357
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,680
I was shocked.

358
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,550
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja

359
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,660
and why should the parents want to come after that?

360
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,840
When I told Yogi he said, "Mother, we'll be very happy

361
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,070
if they are here, and they should be".

362
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,000
He said "It will help the children, it will help the parents".

363
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,690
But the whole, now, attention goes to the children -

364
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,890
that we must leave the children there

365
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,830
and we must look after them, and that's the only thing.

366
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,730
So the attachment to children

367
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,080
will definitely make you do such things,

368
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,640
which are not good - not good for you.

369
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,650
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja Yoga,

370
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,200
I’ve seen - very common.

371
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,910
Then, another attachment is, say, to your family.

372
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,270
Normally, there are no such things in the West.

373
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,790
People are not attached to their family much, you see.

374
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,120
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

375
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Suddenly they become self-realized

376
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,790
and it's like a boomerang, they come back to the family.
Suddenly they become self-realized

377
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:03,800
and it's like a boomerang, they come back to the family.

378
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,920
You see, so attached to the family, attached to the house,

379
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,190
attached to everything. I just can't understand.

380
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,990
If you are becoming the Pure Spirit then you are detached,

381
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,900
because you are just a reflection,

382
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,940
but the reflection of God Almighty.

383
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,250
All these identifications drop out.

384
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,930
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

385
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,650
I've never dropped them.

386
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,070
But still I can suggest certain things, which you can try.

387
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,870
First is meditation.

388
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,630
You should discover about yourself, what's wrong with you,

389
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,190
which side is catching - is it right or left side?

390
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,890
With meditation you can find out.

391
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,470
Are you attached to money,
With meditation you can find out.

392
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,060
are you attached to business, are you attached to your family,

393
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:06,970
are you attached to your country in a way which is not Sahaj,

394
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,210
or to your culture which is not Sahaj.

395
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:18,410
Then try to get rid of this attachment by meditation.

396
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,730
You know how to get rid of the right and the left.

397
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,880
This attachment will show on your fingertips,

398
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,860
and you have to see for yourself what centers you are catching,

399
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,670
in which way are you in trouble.

400
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,370
And then you can clarify it

401
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:44,300
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj treatment.

402
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,610
I think here we fail, that once we get attached to something

403
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,050
we don't even think we are getting attached.

404
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,930
We think we are doing very great thing

405
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,750
because now we love this person, love that person -

406
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,060
Shiva's qualities, the compassion part.

407
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,400
You start getting attached to people. That is no compassion.

408
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,530
That is no compassion of any kind,

409
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,860
to be attached to any such things is no compassion,

410
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,890
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva.

411
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,250
Though people think it is the Shiva's compassion

412
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,080
that is working within us - it's not,

413
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,310
because that compassion is very pure.

414
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,120
It is like, as I've told you many a times,

415
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,840
it's like the sap in the tree which rises

416
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,090
and goes to various parts of the tree,

417
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,270
and then either it evaporates or goes down into Mother Earth.

418
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,470
It's not attached. If it gets attached to one flower,

419
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,490
or to one leaf, or to one fruit

420
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,990
then the whole tree will suffer and also the flower will disappear.
or to one leaf, or to one fruit

421
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,520
then the whole tree will suffer and also the flower will disappear.

422
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,280
So this kind of attachment to a particular thing,

423
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,540
to a particular idea is not proper.

424
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,070
In Sahaja Yoga I've found people are very adaptable

425
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,410
and understand what they should do,

426
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,820
but the main thing is meditation.

427
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,610
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva Tatwa,

428
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,960
on the principle of Shiva, you can definitely detach,

429
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,480
and then the joy will be the maximum,

430
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,050
joy will be the maximum.

431
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,560
I've seen people have interest in, say, food

432
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,710
or in clothes or in house, anything.

433
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,110
You can have interest, you should have interest,

434
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,720
but in that interest there should be enlightenment -

435
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,260
that you cannot get attached to it.

436
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,100
Some people, say, who are, say, from South India,

437
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,540
they don't like North Indian food.

438
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,290
Those who are from North India don't like South Indian.

439
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,470
It's a big problem. I asked the people in Indian Airlines:

440
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,900
"Why don't you have some standard food?”

441
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,840
He said: "What is the standard food of India? Tell me".

442
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,170
It was a (good) question. Indians are very particular

443
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,460
about the taste and food.

444
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,760
So, it's a fact we don't have any standard food in India.

445
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,170
But in the same way, we can say in so many other ways

446
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,990
that in the West people run after things

447
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,750
which are not necessary.

448
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,740
They do things just out of fashion or, I don't know,

449
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,950
because their personality is not grown up.

450
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,830
If your personality is grown up then you see everything,

451
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,840
everything from an angle which is much higher than others,

452
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,590
and you don't get dissolved with others.

453
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,390
What you know is much higher,

454
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,590
much greater and much more joy giving.

455
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,680
Now these attachments, people think that

456
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,430
it's very joy giving.
Now these attachments, people think that

457
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,650
If you get a child and if you have, say, a wife,

458
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,580
everything, are joy-giving. It's a very wrong idea.

459
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,310
The joy comes from your own source of your Spirit.

460
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,660
Whether your husband is good,

461
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,970
whether your children are good or bad, whatever they are,

462
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,920
they cannot give you joy.

463
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,230
It's only you can enjoy your Self,
they cannot give you joy.

464
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:51,270
they cannot give you joy.

465
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:57,320
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

466
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,160
When nobody can harm you,

467
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,690
then whom are you going to be angry with?

468
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,000
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

469
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,300
is that He’s extremely forgiving. He goes up to a point,

470
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,410
till He destroys the whole work of Adi Shakti.

471
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,970
But otherwise He’s very, very forgiving,

472
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,170
and He also is very balanced about it.

473
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,210
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with the whole world -

474
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,820
was so decadent and all that and She started destroying everything.

475
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,070
So He put a little child under Her feet,

476
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,610
and such a big tongue came out with such a shock,

477
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:42,230
She stopped Her destruction.

478
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,650
So His ways are such that a person,

479
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,040
who is to develop the Shiva principle within himself,

480
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,660
should be extremely forgiving.

481
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,150
I know there are people who are very cruel, who are very torturesome.

482
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,350
If you cannot bear it, all right, finish it off.

483
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,270
I'll stand by you there; but if you can bear it,

484
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:16,860
is better to bear, and undergo this experience of bearing it,

485
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,390
because it's not difficult to bear than to get out of it.

486
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,090
For example, a lady came to me, and she said:

487
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,160
"I'm going to divorce my husband". I said: "Why?"

488
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,230
"Because he comes home very late and I get very little of him".

489
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,000
But I said, "When you divorce you'll not get him

490
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,190
at all.
But I said, "When you divorce you'll not get him

491
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,210
But I said, "When you divorce you'll not get him

492
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,890
What's the logic? At least now you see him, whatever it is,

493
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,150
whenever, whatever the time is there.

494
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,230
But this is no solution.

495
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,640
If you divorce him, you'll never see him.

496
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,640
So what's the use of such a divorce?"

497
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,810
So many things like that can be understood

498
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,020
once you are a detached person,

499
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,180
that you are not to be attached to anything.

500
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,910
Now who can aggress you if you are not attached to anyone?

501
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,480
Nobody can. Only thing, when you feel that you have to protest,

502
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,080
you should, but with detachment.

503
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,660
In protest also is important

504
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,870
to absolutely to have a complete detachment.

505
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:30,200
Now, the main problem before us, today, is something else.

506
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,540
Is that we all have to ascend,

507
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:43,880
and ascend with equal strength.

508
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:54,490
There's a story about some birds who were caught in a net,

509
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,700
so they decided that we should get out of this net,

510
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,200
and they tried. Everybody tried to get out.

511
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,490
But nobody, individually, could work it out.

512
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,400
So they all decided to fly together, "One, two, three and go,"

513
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,450
and they took all that net with them.

514
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,910
And they said… then they requested the rats that

515
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:27,470
"Please come and cut our net", and they were freed.

516
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,680
So, if it can happen between the rats and the birds,

517
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,250
why not between us?

518
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,380
So, in collectivity… you'll be amazed in the collectivity

519
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,700
how we could be helpful and joyous with each other.

520
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,560
Now, say something is wrong

521
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,110
with your mother, father, sisters, somebody. Doesn't matter.

522
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,070
After all you have the Ocean of Joy here with the collectivity

523
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,080
and your problems can be solved,

524
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,630
if collectively if you want to solve your problem.

525
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,100
So, we have to depend on the collectivity;

526
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,750
Very much to be one with the collective.

527
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,170
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

528
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,180
the joy itself draws you together.

529
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,900
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing.

530
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,640
We have had so many experiences of that,

531
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,350
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how happy they were

532
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,540
to find Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,

533
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,170
and how they felt happy.

534
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,420
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis

535
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,290
is really the most joyous channel,

536
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,690
and that is what is the source, we should say,

537
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,550
of our becoming one together.

538
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,220
Once you start enjoying each other...

539
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,810
I've told you once a story of a great poet in India,

540
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,730
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

541
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:15,130
And there was another one who was a…

542
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,730
potter. Sometimes I miss out in English words.

543
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,440
This potter was another poet

544
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,720
and he was called as Gora Khumhar.

545
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,180
So, when Namdeva went to meet him -

546
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,560
a saint only feels like meeting a saint -

547
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,720
looked at him, and he just stood back

548
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,960
and then he said a beautiful couplet.

549
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,750
He says that, “I came here to see the formless - Chaitanya,

550
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,950
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

551
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,040
“Nirgunachya bheti alo sagunashi”.

552
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,120
I came to see the formless, to see the vibrations,

553
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,880
but here it is in the form that I see it".

554
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,290
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

555
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,330
This kind of appreciation, this subtle appreciation

556
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,790
is only possible between the two saints,

557
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,770
or between the many.

558
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,650
They don't see [that] he was kneading the clay;

559
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:34,640
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing that work.

560
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,870
He never saw all these things.

561
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,170
He never saw his body, face or anything,

562
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:47,320
but he saw that, the Divinity personified in him.

563
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,360
This sensitivity of feeling for other Sahaja Yogis

564
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,160
should really develop within you.

565
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,750
Then you won't care for nonsensical, superficial things.

566
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:10,640
And this is one of the great principles of Shiva.

567
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,280
He doesn't bother. Now see, His hair are all matted up,

568
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,560
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both the legs like that

569
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,360
going for His wedding – can you imagine?

570
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,060
And all His friends, all His followers are…

571
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,970
somebody has only one eye, another has only one hand,

572
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,960
one is bent like that,

573
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:46,590
because for Him the outside personality doesn't matter.

574
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,370
What matters is the spirituality.

575
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,510
Whether you have one eye or whether you have a crooked body

576
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,250
makes no difference to Him.

577
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,730
To Him all of them are His own people,

578
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:08,480
because nothing that is superficial attracts His attention

579
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,570
but the divinity in a person.

580
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,770
We have so many ways of understanding His principle

581
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,640
because He’s all pervading.

582
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,860
If you feel compassion for someone,

583
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,800
it works. It definitely works.

584
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,240
Recently there was a case of some sort of a

585
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,320
incurable disease in Mexico.

586
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,550
And the lady, who was Mexican, who was working in the UN -

587
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,780
she's still working in UN -

588
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,650
she wrote to Me two letters, that

589
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,910
“Mother, I'm going to lose my son

590
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,810
because he has this horrible disease”.

591
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,380
I mean, just she wrote to Me.

592
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,840
I just felt such compassion for her,

593
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,800
because she wrote a letter which brought tears to My eyes.

594
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,370
And imagine, those tears have cured that boy,

595
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,620
has cured that boy completely,

596
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:37,090
and she wrote Me a letter of thanking and all.

597
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:42,350
I was amazed, because My compassion is not mental,

598
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,450
it just works, it's just there, just flows and works it out.

599
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,530
In the same way, you can also become that.

600
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:58,930
I want you to have all My powers. But first is the compassion.

601
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,570
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another person, anyone,

602
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,240
whether he's a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja Yogi, that's not important.

603
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,090
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

604
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:17,810
If you say even he's a non-Sahaja Yogi,

605
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,660
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

606
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:28,370
That's not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi is different.

607
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,300
Like the other day somebody said, I said,

608
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
"You are very hot-tempered".

609
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,300
"Yes, yes, I am. When somebody provokes me".

610
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,950
I said, "Everybody when he's provoked only gets angry.

611
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,510
Only the mad people are such who do not get angry

612
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,120
even if they are provoked”, you see.

613
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,990
So, if you get angry when you are provoked,

614
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,650
is nothing so great. Everybody gets angry like that,

615
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,970
when you are provoked. But if you say that if you are not provoked

616
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,020
then you will not get angry, that sort of a state is very different.

617
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:09,280
So, what I find (is) that in the whole atmosphere of today,

618
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:18,990
in the modern times, there's a big struggle going on

619
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:23,450
which is not Shiva's culture.

620
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:31,180
Shiva's culture is the, I should say, the Sahaj culture.

621
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:40,120
If you are Sahaja Yogis, you should have compassion in you,

622
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,320
understanding of others' feelings;

623
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,160
and also you should have readiness to look after

624
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,300
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja Yogis,

625
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,450
then your compassion will become effective.

626
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,080
Now, as you know today the biggest problem

627
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,240
of today's civilization

628
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,090
is that Western culture has gone to dogs.

629
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,610
They are going… I mean, when you read the newspaper

630
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,610
you are shocked the way things are happening.

631
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,470
I don't know how many will realize it

632
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,350
before their destruction. It's really self-destructing.

633
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:31,900
On one side this is the self-indulgent and permissive society

634
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,700
which is working.

635
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,540
Now on the other side I find the Islamic culture

636
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,340
is trying to oppose it.

637
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,280
That's correct. They are trying to oppose it is correct.

638
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,260
But the way they are opposing is creating problems.

639
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,160
If you oppress somebody - "Don't do this, don't do that" -

640
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,920
then they'll do it much more. I'll give you the example,

641
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,600
that if you go into the north of India

642
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,520
the culture is more Islamic,

643
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,690
and the people are very licentious

644
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,390
and all the time looking at women and… not all, but many.

645
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,610
Though they are, say they are Hindus or they say this and that.

646
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,030
But still they have all these bad habits

647
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,600
which have come from the Islamic suppression.

648
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,470
When a woman is completely covered

649
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,490
and nobody can see her, they become much more curious.

650
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,830
I have some people who came to Bombay

651
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,160
and somebody was travelling with Me and

652
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,440
he was looking at every woman on the street. I said,

653
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,440
“Your neck will break now, the way you are going on”.

654
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,630
But is a common practice there.

655
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,920
Not only that, but this curiosity goes too far

656
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,060
and people can become extremely immoral,

657
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,910
just like we are in the West.

658
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:03,430
So, the suppression of your desires is also wrong.

659
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,670
Also, this culture which outwardly suppresses

660
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,140
but inwardly people are very immoral.

661
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,790
Once I was traveling from Riyadh to London

662
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,360
and I went off to sleep. When I got up,

663
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,260
I saw some other people sitting there

664
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,200
all very nicely dressed up with short skirts

665
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,710
and men with all the bow ties and this and that.

666
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:32,300
So I asked the airhostess “Did we stop somewhere?”

667
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,350
She said: “No, no, we have been going directly”.

668
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,040
I said: “Then who are these people?” “Same”.

669
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,080
“They are so much changed.” I mean, I was surprised

670
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,740
that they were wearing such long, these chadur and all that,

671
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,130
and now here they are with all these funny dresses.

672
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:53,060
I couldn't understand. That's what happened.

673
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:59,560
The curiosity created by suppression also is not helpful.

674
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,860
In Sahaja Yoga there's no question of suppression.

675
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,810
You become innocent, just become innocent.

676
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,750
That is the principle of Shiva.

677
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,320
This Sahaj culture is in the center.

678
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,340
Neither too much of licentiousness nor too much of suppression,

679
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:22,490
but it is in the center, which is the Shiva's greatest principle -

680
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,870
is to be innocent. And this innocence just shines in you.

681
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,160
I have seen it. You people,

682
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,440
whatever you might have done before, but I see you are so pure.

683
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,010
You don't have these stupid ideas of

684
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:43,840
behaving in a manner that is so Western.

685
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,370
Also, so many Islamic people I've seen

686
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,190
who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

687
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,420
have become very, very Sahaj

688
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,640
and are leading a very good life.

689
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,420
We have some Iranians who sent Me letters of their confessions,

690
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,520
and I was shocked. I never read them

691
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,520
because it was too much for Me. And now I find them to be

692
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,230
the most moral people that way.

693
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,540
So going to one extreme is wrong, or to another is wrong.

694
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,160
But to be in the center, in the Sahaj,

695
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,920
is the best way to understand -

696
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,860
what is so important for life is morality.

697
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,120
And that comes from your innocence.

698
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,690
And that is the quality of -of course Shri Ganesha,

699
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,880
who is the Son of Shiva,

700
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:46,480
but is emitted through the innocence of Shri Shiva.

701
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,380
Now, I think in next lecture of Shiva

702
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,280
I'll talk about innocence to you,

703
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,530
but for this one you have to understand the detachment -

704
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,150
The detachment that should evolve within.

705
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,060
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

706
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,130
you can develop that detachment within you,

707
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,160
which will be really joy giving.

708
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,600
So many qualities of Shiva can be described,

709
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,550
and I think in so many lectures I have told you about Him.

710
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,790
I have to just say that

711
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:32,850
you should have also collective meditation in your ashrams.

712
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:37,720
Will be a good idea if you can try collective meditation,

713
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,220
will be nice. But you don't have to give vibrations to anyone.

714
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,800
You don't have to look after the chakras of others.

715
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,910
You just bother, yourself, what's wrong with you.

716
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,840
And now whatever is the solution

717
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,180
for your ascent you should do it,

718
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:58,730
because the responsibility of the whole world

719
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,940
rests on Sahaja Yogis.

720
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,750
This you know, that there's no way out without Sahaja Yoga.

721
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:11,070
To save humanity from all kinds of problems,

722
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,310
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

723
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,230
So it is your responsibility to keep yourself

724
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:22,420
in proper shape, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

725
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,970
Get rid of your left and get rid of your right,

726
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,950
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga,

727
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,140
not by bombastic words or aggressiveness,

728
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,360
but with love and compassion.

729
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,040
I'm sure we have done a lot, we have achieved a lot,

730
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,950
but there are still some points here and there

731
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,150
which is a very unpleasant task for Me to correct them.

732
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:52,930
But whatever it is I have to say that it's working,

733
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:57,020
and everybody should look at themselves

734
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,100
and feel happy from where they have come here,

735
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,190
and how far we have to go.

736
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,900
May God bless you all.
