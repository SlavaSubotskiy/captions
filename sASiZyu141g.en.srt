1
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:06,680
Today we have gathered here

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,693
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,890
The One, which is reflected within us,
is the Shiva,

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,204
which is the pure Spirit.

5
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:40,590
This pure Spirit within us is
the reflection

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,503
of God Almighty, Sadashiva.

7
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:58,864
It’s like the sun that falls in the water

8
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:04,905
and gives a clear reflection.

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,370
Or else it falls on the stone,

10
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,995
it doesn’t give any reflection at all.

11
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,925
If you have, say, the mirror,

12
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:24,259
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

13
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:31,187
but will reflect back its light.

14
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:36,019
In the same way in the human beings

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:48,369
the reflection of God Almighty is expressed
in the way your personality is.

16
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,980
If your personality is clean and clear,
innocent,

17
00:01:55,181 --> 00:02:00,370
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

18
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:11,200
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God
Almighty in the proper manner,

19
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:19,886
in the sense that their own identification
with wrong things is no more.

20
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:24,068
When there is no such identification

21
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:31,930
and when a person is absolutely the pure
Spirit,

22
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,280
then the reflection of God reflects into
others.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,933
Luckily you all have got your Self
Realization.

24
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:48,839
That means the reflection of God Almighty

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,459
is already working into your attention.

26
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:04,825
The attention is enlightened by the power
of the Spirit.

27
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:12,899
The power of the Spirit is that it is
a reflection.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:20,076
That means the reflection is never
identified

29
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:27,867
with the mirror or with the water.

30
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:34,177
It is there till the sun shines,

31
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,310
and when there is no sun there is
no reflection.

32
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:53,291
So when you are in Sahaja Yoga you have
cleansed out yourself.

33
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:57,190
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

34
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,690
and now you are pure personalities.

35
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:08,080
That’s why this reflection is clearer and
clearer,

36
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:12,049
and people see it; see it on your face;

37
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,379
they see it in your body; they see it
in your work;

38
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,740
in your behaviour; in everywhere.

39
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,960
It is difficult for people to really
believe in themselves,

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,110
that they could be the reflection of God
Almighty.

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,957
They have some sort of a, complexes about
themselves I think,

42
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:48,041
that they cannot understand how they have
suddenly become

43
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:52,029
the reflection of God Almighty,

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,313
but they have a capacity; and they can
become

45
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:05,440
the reflection of God Almighty,

46
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,200
for which they have to have faith
in themselves,

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,719
faith in their ascent, to believe that we
have become that.

48
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:24,867
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very
important.

49
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:30,329
Without the full confidence you cannot
achieve your ascent.

50
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,868
That you have seen even in my lectures,

51
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,300
I have to tell them that we have to have
full self-confidence.

52
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,469
But confidence doesn’t mean by any chance
your ego, your aggressiveness.

53
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,649
If you are confident, you are least
aggressive.

54
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,774
There is a story, a Chinese story, very
interesting one:

55
00:05:56,987 --> 00:06:07,728
that one king wanted his cocks to win in
the race they have about the cock-fighting.

56
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,484
So somebody said that “There is a saint,
if you can take your cocks to him,

57
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:20,580
he’ll make them so strong that they will
definitely win this race.”

58
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,809
So he took his two cocks and gave it to
the saint and he said,

59
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:31,958
“I want you to give them all the strength
to fight this race.”

60
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:38,595
After one month the king came and took
these two cocks,

61
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:43,886
and put them in the arena where there were
many other cocks also.

62
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:52,838
So the cocks started fighting and attacking
these two cocks,

63
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,405
but these two cocks were just standing

64
00:06:55,606 --> 00:07:01,440
very patiently, absolutely calm and quiet.

65
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,416
Any kind of attack they were just looking
at it as a fun,

66
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:12,820
and all the cocks got tired and they ran
away from the arena,

67
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:17,958
and that’s how these two cocks won
the game.

68
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,760
This is what it is for us to understand,

69
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,382
that for a person who is detached he can
never be attacked.

70
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:32,335
We are attacked by so many we have.

71
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:38,199
Firstly our family, then our country,

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,000
then our religion, then all kinds of thing,
racialism.

73
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,599
All these identifications really make
us weak,

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,225
because they attack us all the time

75
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:54,380
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja
Yogis, I have seen.

76
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,000
The reason is, you must have confidence
in Sahaja Yoga

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,850
and confidence in yourself, that you are
on the right path

78
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,290
and that you are now saved, and nobody
can attack you

79
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,569
because you have the complete protection
of the Divine.

80
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,933
People may follow any religion,

81
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:18,230
they may follow any guru, they may follow
anything,

82
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,380
but they have fear all the time that
we’ll be attacked,

83
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,732
and they’re afraid to say things, which
they should say.

84
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:32,309
They have no discretion even to know what
is to be said.

85
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:40,710
With the proper understanding that you are
the pure Spirit,

86
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:45,283
if you believe in that then you’ll be
surprised

87
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:52,634
that you will be very confident about what
you are doing.

88
00:08:52,835 --> 00:09:00,395
In that way we can say that we have also
another great advantage –

89
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,492
is that we are in the collective.

90
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:11,060
We can find out in the collective how are
we behaving.

91
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,379
What is the reaction in the collective?

92
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,598
In the collective it’s a person who is very
subtle,

93
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,586
he need not talk too much, he need not
say much.

94
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:28,190
He could stand like the cocks I told you
about,

95
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,714
but his depth can be felt.

96
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,350
You can feel a person of that caliber,

97
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,499
that he’s such a deep person, that he
doesn’t want to aggress.

98
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,180
He feels protected within himself.

99
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:46,870
So this protection we have to feel,

100
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,804
not mentally but within ourselves,

101
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:54,280
and once you have that gravity,

102
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:59,439
that feeling, nobody can attack you.

103
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:07,263
The attacking person himself is insecure;
or maybe he is ill-bred;

104
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:11,720
maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

105
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,666
So you have to just have a kind of
a gracious view

106
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:25,631
about the person. Like Shiva was.

107
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:28,536
We should say Sadashiva’s character
is known,

108
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:33,459
that He is the one who used to forgive
anyone.

109
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,790
Anybody who did penance like standing
on their heads

110
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,524
or standing on one foot or not eating their
food or all kinds of penances,

111
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:49,359
He used to be so disgusted that He would
say: “Alright, what do you want? Take it!”

112
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:53,651
And He also gave blessings to manyrakshasas

113
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:57,846
as you have heard and so many rakshasas
were blessed by Him,

114
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:03,580
because He got fed up with their penances.

115
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:15,060
There were so many stories about Sadashiva
giving a blessing to people.

116
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,120
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting
story about Ravana,

117
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,119
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don’t
know what he did,

118
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,721
how much he must have starved with his
ten heads and what …

119
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:36,490
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so
hungry – with ten mouths!

120
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,968
I don’t know what he must have done

121
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:44,709
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva
just got fed up, you see.

122
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,969
His compassion is so great He thought:

123
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,725
“Let this man have whatever he likes.”

124
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:54,510
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said:
“What do you want?

125
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,447
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”
So he said that

126
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,836
“I want to have a blessing”. He said:
“What blessing?”

127
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:07,710
“First you promise that whatever I ask for,
you will give me.”

128
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:10,880
He said: “Of course. If it is in my power,
I’ll give”.

129
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,280
It’s a very interesting story.

130
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,270
So he said: “I want to have your wife”.

131
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

132
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,759
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner
with him,

133
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,285
he can do wonders.

134
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:39,294
So he asked that: “I should get your wife
as my partner.”

135
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:45,479
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for
Him to take such a decision

136
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:52,010
to give in to this devil, but in compassion
He did it.

137
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:55,452
And all these events you see really show

138
00:12:55,653 --> 00:13:01,952
that how His compassion works out things.

139
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:11,024
As a result it was decided that

140
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:18,190
His wife Parvati had to go with this
horrible fellow.

141
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:26,875
But Parvati’s sister (brother) was Shri
Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

142
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:33,158
and He said to Himself that: “I can’t allow

143
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,830
my sister to go with this devil. I must do
something about it.”

144
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:42,938
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.
So what He did was

145
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:49,220
to make him feel like going for the
bathroom.

146
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,076
So he felt shy, he put the lady on one side

147
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:59,755
and he went to the bathroom. Now Shiva
had warned him that:

148
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:03,040
“You’d better be careful, because this
Mother Earth

149
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:08,117
is the mother of this lady, and never put
Her on the Mother Earth.

150
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:12,790
You must carry Him (Her) all the time
on your back.”

151
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,480
So when he reached a certain point

152
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,433
this Shri Krishna created a mischief,

153
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,969
and he felt like going.

154
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,186
So he put Her down. As soon as he put
Her down,

155
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:33,030
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he
didn’t know what to do.

156
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,108
Second time again he tried.

157
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:40,334
And he again went to Shiva and he said:

158
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:45,130
“See now, this is what you have promised,
and this is what he is doing.”

159
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,159
So He said: “I had warned you that Her
brother is a very mischievous fellow

160
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,410
and He’ll somehow or other manage,
so you’d better be careful.

161
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:58,164
This time you don’t listen to him.

162
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:02,094
Don’t put Her on the ground, whatever
it may be.”

163
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:09,963
So this time he did another try,

164
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:14,278
we can say, and carried Her on his back.

165
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,745
Suddenly he found a little boy.

166
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:22,010
It was Shri Krishna himself laughing
at him.

167
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,600
He said: “Why are you laughing at me?”

168
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,020
“Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman
on your back?

169
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,900
She has no ornaments.” He said: “She’s
the Goddess.”

170
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,360
He said: “No. She has no ornaments.
She’s wearing nothing.

171
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,170
How can She be the Goddess?”

172
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,420
So you see in India that’s a … proverb
we use.

173
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,189
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives
without any ornaments or anything,

174
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,240
that she’s like the Lanka Parvati.

175
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,030
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And
when he looked at Her up,

176
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,753
he saw a very old woman without any teeth
you know, laughing at him.

177
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:09,436
He got such a fright he threw Her away.
That’s Mahamaya!

178
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:14,620
Then the third situation was, he went
and told that:

179
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:18,551
“You’d better tell your wife that She’s not
to listen to anybody,

180
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,800
and you’d better see that you give me
your wife itself.”

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,540
He said: “Alright, She’ll be born in Lanka
and you can marry Her.”

182
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:31,540
Her name was Mandodari. Now the great
story goes on like that.

183
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:36,654
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper
of Vishnu,

184
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:42,500
and at the time when Rama came, you see,
to kill him.

185
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,260
All this was organised by Mandodari
Herself.

186
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:53,384
She knows, knew that if Shri Rama
kills Ravana

187
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:58,702
he will get his liberation from these ideas
about women;

188
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:04,139
the way he was running after Sita and doing
all these things.

189
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,013
She actually wanted that something should
happen that he should take another birth,

190
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:18,269
and he should get rid of these notions
of looking after beautiful women,

191
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,029
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

192
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,164
She was against it completely, but he
would not listen.

193
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:32,363
So the war took place, and in the war he
was killed by Shri Rama.

194
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:46,628
All this episode came because of the
unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

195
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:54,285
His compassion is to look at, looks very
illogical sometimes,

196
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:57,024
but there’s a big logic behind it.

197
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:01,265
The logic is that whatever He does

198
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:11,461
brings forth a kind of a solution of the
problem.

199
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:17,945
For example, there was a war on, and
the war was going on,

200
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:26,899
and that time there was a problem because
there was one horrible devil

201
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,539
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva

202
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,273
that: “Nobody can kill you.”

203
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:44,172
He had given also blessings - as they call
varadan - to another saint,

204
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,415
who said: “I want to sleep now and nobody
should disturb me.”

205
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:51,880
So he was given a blessing:

206
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,871
“Anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

207
00:18:55,072 --> 00:19:01,411
you can just look at that person and that
will be, he’ll be reduced to ashes.”

208
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:07,456
So these two now, when the war started,
you see, Shri Krishna thought,

209
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:16,320
“Best thing is to kill this devil with
the same blessings

210
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,932
that the saint has got.” So He played

211
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:26,437
and He started running away from
the battlefield;

212
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:32,325
and that’s why He’s called

213
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:38,914
as a warrior who has ran out of the field.

214
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:45,740
Ranchordas – the one who runs away
out of the field of battle.

215
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:52,027
And when He was running He was wearing
a shawl, Shri Krishna.

216
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:55,199
He just stealthily entered into the cave

217
00:19:55,415 --> 00:20:01,987
and there’s another saint was sleeping and
put His shawl on top of that.

218
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:06,439
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

219
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:14,582
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was
following Him, the satanic fellow,

220
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:21,152
he reached that place and saw the same
shawl

221
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,470
and he said: “Oh, so now you are tired

222
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,943
and now you are sleeping here. I’ll put
you right!”

223
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:34,302
Without realising who was sleeping and he
pulled the shawl.

224
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:40,026
And here the sleeping saint gets up and
looks at him,

225
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:43,828
and they say with his third eye he burnt.

226
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:48,037
So the solution came in. So the whole
play is like this,

227
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:54,871
of three forces going on, just to show
ultimately the truth prevails.

228
00:20:55,087 --> 00:21:02,070
First is the, Shiva’s compassion, His
goodness, to one side.

229
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:10,620
Then the play of Shri Krishna or say
Shri Vishnu of neutralizing it;

230
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:24,062
and the third is the play of Brahma who
creates things and who produces things.

231
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:27,803
All these three forces are playing,

232
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:33,543
just to create an atmosphere for all of us
to feel

233
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:38,846
that there is something else is to be done
to our human awareness.

234
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:47,590
All they have evolved within us this desire
to seek the truth.

235
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:52,608
Now on one side Shiva is extremely
compassionate,

236
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,422
very kind even to asuras, the rakshasas.

237
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:03,716
But on the other side He can be extremely
cruel.

238
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:07,747
He can destroy the whole universe.

239
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:11,667
If the people are so decadent,

240
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:18,804
if the people do not take to spirituality,

241
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:24,029
if their innocence is completely lost,

242
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,886
if they do not get detached from all these
wrong identifications

243
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,267
which are creating problems in this world,

244
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:36,646
He destroys the whole universe.

245
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:42,326
So as it is He is the spectator of the work
of Adi Shakti.

246
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,770
He allows Her to do all this work,

247
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:50,511
to create human beings, to give them
Realization, do all this.

248
00:22:50,712 --> 00:22:55,005
But in case He finds Her children,

249
00:22:55,206 --> 00:23:01,408
people who have been saved by Her,
are misbehaving

250
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:05,741
or insulting or in any way destroying
Her work,

251
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:12,822
He might get into a temper by which He can
destroy the whole universe.

252
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:17,314
But I don’t think now there’s any chance
for Him to do that,

253
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:21,384
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

254
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:25,960
But what I find amongst Sahaja Yogis
is this

255
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:30,519
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow
very fast.

256
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,179
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their
principle of Shiva Tattwa.

257
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:46,130
The first achievement shows that from
inside they start getting detached.

258
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,137
Now detachment is not mental. It’s not
mental.

259
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:55,990
It is not that we have to take to some sort
of a sanyasa

260
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,616
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up
our families and all that.

261
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:08,950
But the detachment is within oneself. When
that detachment starts working,

262
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:16,823
the first sign is that we become joyous,
we become happy.

263
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:21,821
Now if you ask anyone: “Why are you
unhappy?”,

264
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:28,711
he’ll talk about his wife, maybe his house,
maybe his children,

265
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:36,376
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever
it is.

266
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:43,357
So he gets absolutely upset, or maybe
very unhappy

267
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,856
to see things happening around him.

268
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:56,140
Now he is a realized soul this unhappiness
is not going to help him.

269
00:24:56,432 --> 00:25:02,443
What is needed is now to know that you
can correct

270
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:10,552
all these ills of the society, of the
family, of the whole country,

271
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:15,550
by transforming others, not by feeling bad.

272
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:22,711
But while doing that, the main thing that
you should have is a complete detachment.

273
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:26,960
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja
Yoga

274
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:32,547
how people told me about their own
countrymen, country fellows,

275
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:37,295
I was amazed how they told me about their
own religions,

276
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:40,715
how wrong things they are doing.

277
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,685
I didn’t know so much as they told me,

278
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:47,483
and I thought that this is a detachment
that has come

279
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:51,538
that they can see clearly what’s wrong;

280
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:59,750
what’s wrong with my society, with
my people,

281
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:05,963
with my relations, with my family, with my
country, with the whole world.

282
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:13,635
But is only possible if you are not
identified through any one of them,

283
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,586
otherwise you will never see the defects.

284
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:18,842
You’ll never see what’s wrong with
that person.

285
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,711
You can never even see the chakras, which
are catching.

286
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:28,255
So the first thing that should happen
is detachment.

287
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:32,693
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

288
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:36,357
Many people ask me, “Mother, how do you
get detached?”

289
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,825
Because I am not attached you see, so I’m
already detached.

290
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:42,548
I don’t know how to do that way.

291
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:48,766
But for you people I would say,
to understand yourself

292
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,389
you should introspect.

293
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:57,307
Try to find out to what thing am I
attached. Why am I miserable?

294
00:26:57,508 --> 00:27:01,367
For whom am I worried? Why should I worry?

295
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:05,841
Some things you see which were never
very important,

296
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,668
they become very important to certain
Sahaja Yogis.

297
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:14,510
For example I was told that in the West,
people don’t care

298
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:22,389
so much for their children. But as soon
as they get Realization

299
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,509
they just get attached to their children,
like as if with some glue.

300
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,630
They cannot think what is good for
their children.

301
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:40,065
Everything about children they think is
their primary duty.

302
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:46,032
The other day I was surprised when they
told me that it’s the parents

303
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:53,200
who want to come after the Birthday Puja.
I was shocked.

304
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,171
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja.

305
00:27:56,372 --> 00:28:02,180
Why should the parents want to come
after that?

306
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:05,329
When I told Yogi he said: “Mother,

307
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,629
we’ll be very happy if they are here, and
they should be.

308
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,592
Because it will help the children, it will
help the parents.”

309
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:15,264
But the whole now attention goes
to the children,

310
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:19,790
that “We must leave the children there
and we must look after them”,

311
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,351
and that’s the only thing.

312
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:31,600
So the attachment to children will
definitely make you do such things,

313
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,430
which are not good, not good for you.

314
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:41,784
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja
Yoga, I’ve seen, very common.

315
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:45,486
Then another attachment is, say, to your
family.

316
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:49,855
Normally there are no such things
in the West.

317
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:52,309
People are not attached to their family
much, you see.

318
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,798
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

319
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,640
Suddenly they become self-realized

320
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,845
and it’s like a boomerang, they come back
to the family

321
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:11,440
It is so attached to the family, attached
to the house,

322
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,763
attached to everything. I just can’t
understand.

323
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:20,510
If you are becoming the pure Spirit then
you are detached,

324
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,459
because you are just a reflection, but
the reflection of God Almighty.

325
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,795
So all these identifications drop out.

326
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,499
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

327
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,169
I’ve never dropped them,

328
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,590
but still I can suggest certain things,
which you can try.

329
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,390
First is meditation.

330
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,186
You should discover about yourself, what’s
wrong with you,

331
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:50,719
which side is catching, is it right or left
side.

332
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,180
With meditation you can find out.

333
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:57,099
Are you attached to money, are you
attached to business,

334
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,476
are you attached to your family, are you
attached to your country

335
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:08,510
in a way which is not Sahaj

336
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,815
or to your culture, which is not Sahaj?

337
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:19,006
Then try to get rid of this attachment
by meditation.

338
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:23,343
You know how to get rid of the right
and the left.

339
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:27,473
This attachment will show on your
fingertips,

340
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:32,432
and you have to see for yourself what
centres you are catching,

341
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:38,969
in which way are you in trouble. And then
you can clarify it

342
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,820
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj
treatment.

343
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:51,191
I think here we fail, that once we get
attached to something,

344
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,605
we don’t even think we are getting
attached.

345
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,489
We think we are doing very great thing

346
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,270
because now we love this person, love
that person,

347
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,600
Shiva’s qualities, the compassion part.

348
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:07,731
You start getting attached to people.

349
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:12,391
That is no compassion. That is no
compassion of any kind.

350
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:16,251
To be attached to any such things is
no compassion,

351
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:20,491
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva,

352
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:24,018
though people think it is the Shiva’s
compassion that is working within us.

353
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:35,466
It’s not, because that compassion is very
pure.

354
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:39,942
It is like as I’ve told you many a times,
it’s like the sap in the tree

355
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:45,773
which rises and goes to various parts
of the tree,

356
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:52,532
and then either it evaporates or goes down
into Mother Earth. It’s not attached.

357
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:59,977
If it gets attached to one flower or to one
leaf or to one fruit,

358
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:07,251
then the whole tree will suffer and also
the flower will disappear.

359
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:16,257
So this kind of attachment to a particular
thing, to a particular idea is not proper.

360
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:24,512
In Sahaja Yoga I’ve found people are very
adaptable and understand

361
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:29,565
what they should do, but the main thing
is meditation.

362
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:33,130
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva
Tattwa,

363
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:37,660
on the principle of Shiva, you can
definitely detach,

364
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:44,772
and then the joy will be the maximum,
joy will be the maximum.

365
00:32:44,973 --> 00:32:48,323
I’ve seen people have interest in, say,
food

366
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:55,513
or in clothes or in house, anything.

367
00:32:55,714 --> 00:33:01,637
You can have interest, you should have
interest, but in that interest

368
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:07,780
there should be enlightenment, that you
cannot get attached to it.

369
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:15,232
Some people, say, who are say, from South
India, they don’t like North Indian food.

370
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:18,959
Those who are from North India don’t like
South Indian.

371
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,209
It’s a big problem. I asked the people
in Indian Airlines:

372
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,529
“Why don’t you have some standard food?”

373
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,484
He said: “What is the standard food
of India? Tell me.”

374
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:30,554
But it was a question.

375
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:34,165
Indians are very particular about
the taste and food.

376
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:39,505
So it’s a fact we don’t have any standard
food in India.

377
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:42,885
But in the same way, we can say in so many
other ways

378
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:52,454
that in the West people run after things,
which are not necessary.

379
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:57,396
They do things just out of fashion, or
I don’t know,

380
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:00,644
because their personality is not grown-up.

381
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:07,693
If your personality is grown up then you
see everything, everything

382
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:11,530
from an angle, which is much higher
than others,

383
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:14,278
and you don’t get dissolved with others.

384
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:20,363
What you know is much higher, much greater
and much more joy giving.

385
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:25,144
Now these attachments, people think that
it’s very joy giving.

386
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:32,383
If you get a child and if you have say,
a wife and everything, are joy giving.

387
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,313
It’s a very wrong idea.

388
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:39,040
The joy comes from your own source
of your Spirit.

389
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:44,110
Whether your husband is good, whether
your children are good or bad,

390
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:48,392
whatever they are, they cannot give you
joy.

391
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:52,023
It’s only you can enjoy yourself,

392
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:58,576
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

393
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:04,457
When nobody can harm you, then whom are
you going to be angry with?

394
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:07,600
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

395
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,994
is that He is extremely forgiving.

396
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:16,128
He goes up to a point, till He destroys
the whole work of Adi Shakti.

397
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:19,703
But otherwise He is very, very forgiving,

398
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:23,890
and He also is very balanced about it.

399
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:27,902
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with
the whole world,

400
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:32,518
was so decadent and all that and She
started destroying everything.

401
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,760
So He put a little child under Her feet,

402
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:39,263
and such a big tongue came out with
such a shock,

403
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:42,950
She stopped Her destruction.

404
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:47,334
So His ways are such that a person

405
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:53,757
who is to develop the Shiva principle
within himself

406
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:57,424
should be extremely forgiving.

407
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:02,127
I know there are people who are very cruel
and who are very tortur.

408
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:07,078
If you cannot bear it, alright, finish
it off.

409
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:10,993
I’ll stand by you there; but if you can
bear it

410
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:17,541
is better to bear, and undergo this
experience of bearing it,

411
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:23,151
because it’s not difficult to bear than
to get out of it.

412
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,795
For example, a lady came to me, and
she said:

413
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:28,894
“I’m going to divorce my husband.”
I said: “Why?”

414
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:32,953
“Because he comes home very late and
I get very little of him.”

415
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:39,528
But I said, “When you divorce you’ll not
get him at all! What’s the logic?

416
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:43,751
At least now you see him, whatever it is,
whenever, whatever the time is there.

417
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:49,369
But this is no solution. If you divorce him
you’ll never see him.

418
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,403
So what’s the use of such a divorce?”

419
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:58,743
So many things like that can be understood
once you are a detached person,

420
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:01,914
that you are not to be attached
to anything.

421
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:07,612
Now who can aggress you if you are not
attached to anyone?

422
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:11,855
Nobody can. Only thing when you feel

423
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:15,815
that you have to protest, you should,
but with detachment.

424
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:23,588
In protest also is important to absolutely
to have a complete detachment.

425
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:30,938
Now the main problem before us today
is something else:

426
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:36,889
is that we all have to ascend,

427
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:45,549
and ascend with equal strength.

428
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:55,160
There’s a story about some birds who were
caught in a net,

429
00:37:55,361 --> 00:38:00,564
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

430
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:06,193
Everybody tried to get out, but nobody
individually could work it out.

431
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:11,145
So they all decided to fly together, “One,
two, three, go!”,

432
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:15,134
and they took all that net with them.

433
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:25,919
And they said, then they requested the rats
that “Please come and cut our net.”

434
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,243
And they were freed.

435
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:32,399
So if it can happen between the rats
and the birds,

436
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,902
why not between us?

437
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:40,056
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed,

438
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:45,419
in the collectivity how we could be helpful
and joyous with each other.

439
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,273
Now say something is wrong

440
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:52,834
with your mother, father, sisters,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

441
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:57,760
After all you have the ocean of joy here
with the collectivity,

442
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,936
and your problems can be solved

443
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:04,360
if collectively, if you want to solve
your problem.

444
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:07,817
So we have to depend on the collectivity,

445
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:11,424
very much to be one with the collective.

446
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:16,898
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

447
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,925
the joy itself draws you together.

448
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,596
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing!

449
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:26,407
We have had so many experiences of that,

450
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:31,445
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how
happy they were to find

451
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:37,910
Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,
and how they felt happy.

452
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:48,003
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

453
00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:55,319
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

454
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,525
Once you start enjoying each other…

455
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,537
I’ve told you once a story of a great
poet in India

456
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:09,428
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

457
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:17,335
And there was another one who was
a… potter.

458
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:20,464
Sometimes I miss out in English words.

459
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:30,557
This potter was another poet and he was
called as Gorakumbhar.

460
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:33,876
So when Namdeva went to meet him –

461
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:37,308
a saint only feels like meeting a saint –

462
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:45,691
looked at him, and he just stood back and
then he said a beautiful couplet.

463
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:52,467
He says that: “I came here to see the form,
formless Chaitanya,

464
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:57,664
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

465
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:00,738
‘Nirgunachah beti allo sagunashi’ -

466
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:05,819
“I came to see the formless, to see
the vibrations,

467
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,597
but here the, it is in the form that
I see it.”

468
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:15,032
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

469
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:19,079
This kind of appreciation, this subtle
appreciation

470
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,493
is only possible between the two saints,
or between the many.

471
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,372
They don’t see he was kneading the clay;

472
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:35,395
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing
that work.

473
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:37,586
He never saw all these things.

474
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,852
He never saw his body, face or anything,

475
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:48,506
but he saw that the Divinity personified
in him.

476
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:55,019
This sensitivity of feeling for other
Sahaja Yogis

477
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,856
should really develop within you.

478
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:05,457
Then you won’t care for nonsensical,
superficial things,

479
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:11,354
and this is one of the great principles
of Shiva.

480
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:17,025
He doesn’t bother. Now see, His hair
are all matted up,

481
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:23,263
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both
the legs like that

482
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:27,657
going for His wedding. Can you imagine?

483
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:31,472
And all His friends, all His followers

484
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:36,705
are somebody has only one eye, another
has only one hand,

485
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:39,644
one is bent like that,

486
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:47,908
because for Him the outside personality
doesn’t matter.

487
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:53,694
What matters is the spirituality. Whether
you have one eye

488
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:57,959
or whether you have a crooked body makes
no difference to Him.

489
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,407
To Him all of them are His own people,

490
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:09,208
because nothing that is superficial
attracts His attention,

491
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:13,297
but the divinity in a person.

492
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:18,552
We have so many ways of understanding
His principle,

493
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:22,308
because He is all-pervading.

494
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:29,905
If you feel compassion for someone
it works. It definitely works.

495
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:41,011
Recently there was a case of some sort
of a, incurable disease in Mexico.

496
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:43,025
And the lady, who was Mexican,

497
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:46,405
who was working in the UN, she’s still
working in UN,

498
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:52,571
she wrote to me two letters, that “Mother,
I’m going to lose my son

499
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:59,078
because he has this horrible disease.”
I mean, just she wrote to me.

500
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:03,535
I just felt such compassion for her,

501
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:08,518
because she wrote a letter, which brought
tears to my eyes.

502
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:14,183
And imagine, those tears have cured
that boy!

503
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:22,683
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: “It has fallen.”
Then Hindi)

504
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:30,301
Has cured that boy completely,

505
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:37,794
and she wrote me a letter of, thanking
and all.

506
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:43,110
I was amazed, because my compassion
is not mental.

507
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:49,171
It just works, it’s just there, just flows
and works it out.

508
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:53,207
In the same way you can also become that.

509
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:56,290
I want you to have all my powers.

510
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:59,642
But first is the compassion.

511
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:03,161
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another
person, anyone.

512
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:06,959
Whether he’s a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja
Yogi, that’s not important.

513
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:12,792
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

514
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:22,443
If you say even he’s a non Sahaja Yogi,
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

515
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:29,181
That’s not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja
Yogi is different.

516
00:45:29,382 --> 00:45:32,200
Like the other day somebody said, I said:
“You are very hot-tempered.”

517
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,450
“Yes, yes, I am, when somebody provokes
me.”

518
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,732
I said: “Everybody when he’s provoked
only gets angry.

519
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:46,898
Only the mad are such who do not get angry
when they are provoked, you see.

520
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,124
So if you get angry when you are provoked,
is nothing so great.

521
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:54,406
Everybody gets angry like that, when you
are provoked.

522
00:45:54,607 --> 00:45:57,957
But if you say that if you are not provoked
then you will not get angry,

523
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:00,754
that sort of a state is very different.”

524
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:10,046
So what I find, that in the whole
atmosphere of today

525
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:19,590
in the modern times, there’s a big struggle
going on,

526
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:24,247
which is not Shiva’s culture.

527
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:32,777
Shiva’s culture is the, I should say,
the Sahaj culture.

528
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:40,807
If you are Sahaja Yogis you should have
compassion in you,

529
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:46,119
understanding of others’ feelings;

530
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,976
and also should have readiness to look
after

531
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:56,099
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja
Yogis,

532
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,349
then your compassion will become effective.

533
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:08,759
Now as you know today, the biggest problem
of today’s civilisation

534
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,878
is the Western culture has gone to dogs.

535
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,344
They are going, I mean when you read
the newspaper

536
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,368
you are shocked the way things are
happening.

537
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:23,643
I don’t know how many will realise it
before their destruction.

538
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,162
It’s really self-destructing.

539
00:47:26,363 --> 00:47:34,461
On one side this is the self-indulgent and
permissive society, which is working.

540
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:43,107
Now on the other side I find the Islamic
culture is trying to oppose it.

541
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:47,074
That’s correct, their trying to oppose it
is correct,

542
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:51,062
but the way they are opposing is creating
problems.

543
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:54,898
If you oppress somebody – “Don’t do this,
don’t do that” –

544
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:58,743
then they’ll do it much more. I’ll give
an example,

545
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:06,276
that if you go into the north of India
the culture is more Islamic,

546
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:12,093
and the people are very licentious and
all the time looking at women.

547
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:17,333
Not all, but many; though they are say,
they are Hindus or they say this and that,

548
00:48:17,534 --> 00:48:20,806
but still they have all these bad habits,

549
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:24,367
which have come from Islamic suppression.

550
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,252
When a woman is completely covered

551
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:32,271
and nobody can see her, they become much
more curious.

552
00:48:32,472 --> 00:48:37,286
I have some people who came to Bombay
and somebody was travelling with me,

553
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:39,749
and he was looking at every woman
on the street.

554
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:44,239
I tell, I said: “Your neck will break now,
the way you are going on.”

555
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,398
But is a common practice there.

556
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,696
Not only that, but this curiosity goes
too far

557
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:52,767
and people can become extremely immoral,

558
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:55,700
just like we are in the West.

559
00:48:55,901 --> 00:49:04,496
So the suppression of your desires is
also wrong.

560
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:10,430
Also this culture, which outwardly
suppresses,

561
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:14,911
but inwardly people are very immoral.

562
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:20,354
Once I was travelling from Riyadh to London
and I went off to sleep.

563
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:24,814
When I got up, I saw some other people
sitting there all very nicely dressed up

564
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:30,479
with short skirts and women with –
all the bow ties and this and that -

565
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,146
so I asked the air hostess, I said: “Did we
stop somewhere?”

566
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,163
She said: “No, no, we have been going
directly.”

567
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,922
I said: “Then who are these people?”
“Same.”

568
00:49:39,123 --> 00:49:41,861
“They are so much changed!” I mean,
I was surprised

569
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,571
that they were wearing such long, these
chador and all that,

570
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:49,932
and now here they are with all these
funny dresses.

571
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:53,873
I couldn’t understand. So that’s what
happens.

572
00:49:54,074 --> 00:50:00,374
The curiosity created by suppression also
is not helpful.

573
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,517
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no question
of suppression.

574
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:06,641
You become innocent, just become innocent.

575
00:50:06,842 --> 00:50:09,517
That is the principle of Shiva.

576
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:14,998
This Sahaj culture is in the centre. It has
neither too much of licentiousness

577
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,049
nor too much of suppression, but it is
in the centre,

578
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:25,246
which is the, Shiva’s greatest principle is
to be innocent.

579
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:29,565
And this innocence just shines in you,
I have seen it.

580
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,620
You people, whatever you might have
done before,

581
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:37,721
but I see you are so pure. You don’t have
these stupid ideas

582
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:44,619
of behaving in a manner that is so Western.

583
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,996
Also, so many Islamic people I’ve seen who
have come to Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:50:49,197 --> 00:50:53,207
have become very, very Sahaj

585
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:57,457
and are leading a very good life.

586
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:03,004
We have some Iranians who sent me
letters of their confessions,

587
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:06,807
and I was shocked. I never read them
because it was too much for me.

588
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:12,035
And now I find them to be the most moral
people that we have.

589
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:17,296
So going to one extreme is wrong, or
to another is wrong.

590
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:22,668
But to be in the centre, in the Sahaj is
the best way to understand

591
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:27,646
what is so important for life is morality.

592
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:30,960
And that comes from your innocence.

593
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:38,676
And that is the quality of, of course,
Shri Ganesha, who is the Son of Shiva,

594
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:47,599
but is emitted through the innocence
of Shri Shiva.

595
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:56,043
Now I think in next lecture of Shiva
I’ll talk about innocence to you,

596
00:51:56,244 --> 00:52:01,302
but for this one you have to understand
the detachment,

597
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,941
the detachment that should evolve within.

598
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:07,817
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

599
00:52:08,018 --> 00:52:13,966
you can develop that detachment within you,
which will be really joy giving.

600
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,366
So many qualities of Shiva can be
described,

601
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:23,522
and I think in so many lectures I have told
you about Him.

602
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:30,699
I have to just say that you should have
also collective meditation

603
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,186
in your ashrams. Will be a good idea

604
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:39,281
if you can try collective meditation,
will be nice.

605
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:42,027
But you don’t have to give vibrations
to anyone.

606
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:45,523
You don’t have to look after the chakras
of others.

607
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:48,676
You just bother, yourself, what’s wrong
with you.

608
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:54,016
And now whatever is the solution for your
ascent you should do it,

609
00:52:54,217 --> 00:53:01,748
because the responsibility of the whole
world rests on Sahaja Yogis.

610
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:06,562
This you know, that there’s no way out
without Sahaja Yoga.

611
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:11,835
To save humanity from all kinds
of problems,

612
00:53:12,036 --> 00:53:15,071
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

613
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:20,924
So it is your responsibility to keep
yourself in proper shape,

614
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,214
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

615
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:26,708
get rid of your left and get rid of your
right,

616
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:32,723
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga, not
by bombastic words

617
00:53:32,924 --> 00:53:37,141
or aggressiveness, but with love and
compassion.

618
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:40,821
I’m sure we have done a lot, we have
achieved a lot,

619
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:44,689
but there are still some points here
and there

620
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,971
which is a very unpleasant task for me
to correct them.

621
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:53,691
But whatever it is I have to say that
it’s working,

622
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:57,775
and everybody should look at themselves

623
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,881
and feel happy from where they have
come here,

624
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:03,010
and how far we have to go.

625
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,933
May God bless you all.
