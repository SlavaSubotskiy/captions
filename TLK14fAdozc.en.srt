1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,353
If you don't hear me this time please tell me.

2
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:09,698
I am sorry for being late,

3
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,051
for this lecture

4
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:16,757
but, 

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,309
Dr. Warren had time to explain to you,

6
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,434
about this experience.

7
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,671
Sometimes it is easier to understand

8
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,171
this from a person,

9
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,671
who has achieved it,

10
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:37,303
than to understand from a person

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,894
who is talking from some tenth storey.

12
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:43,644
That's what my father told me, 

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,552
that if somebody's born on the tenth storey,

14
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,042
and the rest of them are on the first floor,

15
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,091
if you start telling them from there they will first of all not listen,

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,917
nor will they understand what you see.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,870
It's not proper,

18
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:06,263
that we should try to tell them something from a level,

19
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:09,556
to a level, which is still there static,

20
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
in their mind.

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:16,523
So one has to, raise their, consciousness,

22
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:20,740
two three storeys so they start seeing that there's something beyond.

23
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:26,105
But, in doing so,

24
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:29,336
so many mistakes,

25
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:34,668
have been, there, before,

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,545
and some people have done it deliberately,

27
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:40,217
some are misguided

28
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,670
and some are doing it deliberately.

29
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,623
Net result is just the same.

30
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:49,443
Even if you give poison to someone by mistake,

31
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:54,599
or in a misguided way, the result is the same.

32
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,682
In the same way,

33
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,462
whether you are misguided,

34
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:03,437
or whether you do it deliberately, whatever is wrong

35
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,829
has an effect on the kundalini.

36
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,946
Now the Aquarian Age,

37
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:13,023
is the word I picked up from Dr. Warren,

38
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,437
which is so true today.

39
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,476
Aquarian means the water carrier,

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,565
and in Sanskrit language it is called as kumbha.

41
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:26,666
Kumbha is the one what we call the kundalini,

42
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,320
the mooladhara is the kumbha,

43
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:33,823
where the kundalini is there, the power of kundalini is there.

44
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:37,030
So to call it an Aquarian age must be some,

45
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,736
work of some, realized soul who could see that,

46
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:44,838
in this age the kundalini is going to be awakened,

47
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:51,709
and that, an age will start of people getting their kundalini awakened.

48
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:56,545
Now I have already talked to you the other day about

49
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:00,234
this second center, which is called as swadhisthana,

50
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:03,255
which gives us our sustenance

51
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:05,755
and also our power to create.

52
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,849
The sustenance is created inside,

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,697
that green part, which is,

54
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,734
represented by main ten Primordial Masters,

55
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,622
and these ten Primordial Masters had another

56
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,968
series of masters who were called as,

57
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:28,145
Disciple Principles.

58
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:31,660
Now about these people I have talked to you last time,

59
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,759
but today I would like to speak to you

60
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:38,492
about other centers, specially this nabhi,

61
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:45,011
which is the navel centre which is very important in human beings.

62
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:49,321
This is the centre by which we seek.

63
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:53,388
When in amoeba stage we seek,

64
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:58,037
food, at a higher level

65
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,428
we start seeking heights,

66
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,910
like when they became mammoth and all these

67
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,410
animals they wanted to have a height,

68
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:11,459
to go over the trees to be able to master them and to eat the leaves,

69
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,875
but they became so much outsized with their height,

70
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:17,701
that they had to become smaller animals,

71
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,371
like say intelligent animals,

72
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:25,376
and, like say cats and things like that, cat family.

73
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:30,736
And this is how the evolution has been,

74
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:36,551
brought forth through our seeking as amoeba,

75
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,814
then as animals and now as human beings.

76
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,038
As we have evolved higher and higher,

77
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:46,718
we have become subtler and subtler in our seeking.

78
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:51,337
For example the people who are seeking say power,

79
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,442
are not so evolved as people who are seeking their spirit, no doubt about it.

80
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,338
Because you have gone through that, you have had enough of it.

81
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:03,265
Maybe last lives you might have been kings and queens

82
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:05,704
and you must have seen all the jokes of it,

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,013
so you said now, it's had enough of it,

84
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,328
this power business, we don't want to have anymore,

85
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,526
such a headache we don't want to have.

86
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,747
The people who are seeking money also,

87
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:18,560
are the people who have had enough of it

88
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,038
and they were fed up of it so they said now we have had it.

89
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:25,827
So now you are seekers of, something beyond.

90
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,960
It has been always so, something beyond we seek,

91
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:32,868
but this seeking beyond is not described

92
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:36,677
to so many people and they are not able to understand

93
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:40,479
what is the beyond, that's why this center is very important,

94
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,656
of your evolutionary process.

95
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,378
Now, first of all as I have told you that we have to be in balance,

96
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:53,833
that's one thing we must have is the balance in life.

97
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,407
I mean in commonsense also we can see supposing there's

98
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,433
a car going only on one wheel,

99
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,545
how many would like to travel by that.

100
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:06,371
Anything that you do in life has to have a balance,

101
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,011
otherwise, anything, even catching something, holding something

102
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,590
or, small small things, even riding a bicycle

103
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:18,959
you know that you have to have a balance.

104
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,788
So if the kundalini has to move,

105
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,486
you have to be a balanced personality,

106
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,684
a personality with a temperate,

107
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:32,383
nature and must have a balanced attitude towards life.

108
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,797
That is very important, but in case it is not,

109
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:39,827
you can be sucked into the central path of the sushumna,

110
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,025
in the central path of your evolution.

111
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:45,739
Now the evolution takes place by remaining in the central path.

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,236
Those who go to the extremes fall out of this.

113
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:54,722
Now the virus that we suffer from very commonly,

114
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:58,777
is nothing but a kind of a vegetable

115
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,889
which is fallen out of evolution.

116
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:04,762
Now the vegetable that we call as tobacco,

117
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:09,698
is going to fall out of complete evolution and you'll be surprised after

118
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,371
some years you will not find

119
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:16,152
any tobacco growing anywhere because it will go out of evolution,

120
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:21,777
thanks to human beings that they misunderstood the role of tobacco.

121
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:25,204
Tobacco is an insecticide, is to be used

122
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,885
for killing the insects and not to kill yourself.

123
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:33,873
But, we sometimes forget, that whatever,

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
God has created for the good,

125
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:40,178
sometimes we can use it for our destruction.

126
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:44,640
Same is alcohol. Alcohol was created for polishing,

127
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,795
it's very good for example if you have to polish your crystal,

128
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,690
you should use gin is very good,

129
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,221
for diamonds or anything.

130
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:59,543
Is just a polish, it's a polish for the,

131
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,470
for anything, it gives a polish. You see alcohol is a polish and

132
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:07,715
its composition is such that it gives a polish to a thing.

133
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,665
Now God wanted you to have polished surfaces and polished things

134
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,987
and all the clean look of it so He gave you this polish.

135
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,856
Now you started drinking it, now what to do.

136
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,639
He never asked you to drink, but if you drink that,

137
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,250
then it polishes your intestines also.

138
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:31,122
But it has its own nature. It doesn't have any

139
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:35,609
idea of morality, poor thing what, we can't blame the alcohol,

140
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:40,099
because it is suppose to polish, wherever you put it it polishes all right,

141
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:43,024
so it polishes your liver also nicely.

142
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,074
And when the liver is nicely polished then what happens

143
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,487
that the heat from the liver,

144
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:57,273
which is for the expulsion from the body,

145
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:00,996
it has to pass into the bloodstream, cannot because there's a,

146
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:03,559
barrier and because of that barrier

147
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:06,123
poor liver does not know what to do.

148
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:09,781
It just goes on accumulating all the heat within it

149
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,896
and that's how your liver goes out of circulation of anything,

150
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:19,389
and you have liver problems and you feel very giddy, nauseated,

151
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,007
and liver is the one which really cleanses your attention.

152
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:27,330
Whatever you gather from your attention it cleanses.

153
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:32,419
So you become horrid I mean you are all the time angry,

154
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:35,965
hot-tempered, you bark at people all the time,

155
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:40,794
all that thing is typically liverish you see. We grow tall,

156
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:44,621
like that absolutely straight line, and

157
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:48,178
you become very hot-tempered. Sometimes you could be hawk-like you know,

158
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,313
people will be afraid of going nearer such a person,

159
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,656
because such a person can be very dry personality

160
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,433
and that's why you'll find,

161
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,921
drunkard people if you they're over-drunk you go near them they'll just

162
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,276
beat you for nothing at all. I mean

163
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,585
it sometimes happens that by chance

164
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:08,059
if you go and ask some drunkard that: 'What's the time?' in the night

165
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,244
you will have it.

166
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:15,265
So, because it spoils your awareness

167
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:19,412
and in that awareness a nice man also could be like that,

168
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:24,186
but of course there could be a case where a person might become better.

169
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,072
That is also another thing that can happen

170
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,571
when you get possessed by this

171
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:32,576
left-side movement because alcohol reduces

172
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,068
your awareness and you go to the left-side movement to the left side,

173
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,148
may give you, a feeling 'Oh I'm very much better now'

174
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,032
and sort of you get happy because your ego is subsided and everything is

175
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:49,104
alright and 'I'm really moderate now, I cannot hit anyone

176
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,525
and let me have little bit and sleep off'.

177
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:54,006
But next day there's a hangover

178
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,145
and you feel so horrible with it,

179
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,496
that you don't know what to do, I mean

180
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,996
it's something, then again you want to have it in the night

181
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:04,607
because you want to again go to the same realm into the left side.

182
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:09,308
Now this left side realm, apparently shows that there is

183
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:14,695
reduction in the weight of the ego, but it does not, it wobbles.

184
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:19,385
What happens that you go to the superego on the left hand side you see there,

185
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:24,087
and the ego then thinks that it has gone down because the superego

186
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:28,853
increases in size. But when superego increases, the ego is pushed down

187
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:33,070
and then when you come to your ego condition,

188
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,705
then it pushes down so there's a big wobbling going on,

189
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,809
and such people get ultimately very much confused.

190
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,264
They might end up in a lunatic asylum I don't know what they do,

191
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:48,698
but, when they are even sane you can find they lose the grip over life,

192
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:52,891
for example such people can become very frivolous, and

193
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:56,139
cannot feel the joy of life without drinking.

194
00:11:56,487 --> 00:12:01,691
It's most amazing that people can't enjoy each other unless and until

195
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:06,934
there's a glass in between. I mean human beings are so beautiful,

196
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:12,690
and they have the capacity to enjoy each other, so much,

197
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:17,602
they are the only ones who are blessed more than anybody else.

198
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,715
But if there's a glass all the time in between

199
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:23,215
then they can just bark at each other,

200
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,564
they cannot enjoy each other.

201
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:29,837
The enjoyment should be complete when there's nothing in between.

202
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,447
Now this is what I was telling you, this nahbi chakra.

203
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:39,317
This nahbi chakra gets, ruined also when we take to,

204
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:42,867
alcohols or serious things like that, drugs and,

205
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:45,518
even I've seen certain medicines can spoil this.

206
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:49,278
Then you get a problem with the other things like digestion,

207
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,856
you get constipation, all sorts of things take place,

208
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,165
by which you develop

209
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:57,864
gas troubles and other troubles and then your heart troubles and it

210
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,042
goes on one after another.

211
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,135
I do not say that it's only alcohol that will cause.

212
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:07,552
There are other causes also, but alcohol can never be helpful,

213
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:11,032
in giving you good health. Some people

214
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,482
have a feeling that if you take alcohol then only you will keep good health.

215
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:18,473
Is a wrong thing. Because health is not only physical health.

216
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,966
It's also mental health. People think that

217
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,451
physical health is the end of everything,

218
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,627
is absolutely wrong because we are not only the physical being.

219
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,549
We are also the mental being and the emotional being.

220
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,480
And when you play too much with your nahbi chakra

221
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:39,476
you have the biggest problem and that is that

222
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,125
you can never be successful in life

223
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,704
as far as enjoyment is concerned, of your achievements.

224
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,147
For example a person becomes rich,

225
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:53,059
unduly rich he becomes, is a blessing

226
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:55,777
I should say of nahbi chakra on the right-hand side.

227
00:13:56,557 --> 00:14:01,621
Right-hand side nahbi chakra can give you a lot of wealth,

228
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:07,123
a lot of money and you'll have ten cars and fifteen people attending to you,

229
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,531
everything you may have but, it cannot,

230
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,800
it cannot give you the satisfaction of life.

231
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:19,606
You will go on accumulating and end up with a suicide or something like that

232
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
and you would not know why you are

233
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,570
bent upon committing suicide.

234
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,070
That's why in all affluent countries you find

235
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,376
people are planning to commit suicide

236
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,145
and the more affluent they are the worse it is.

237
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:35,298
But the left side gets completely dried.

238
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:39,481
Now the left side is the centre of

239
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,658
the family life, the Gruhalaxshmi,

240
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,727
the Goddess of the family,

241
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,830
the household you see.

242
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,607
A person who runs after money too much,

243
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:53,747
forgets his family. He has no time for his family.

244
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:56,297
The husband and wife may meet somewhere

245
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,871
on the airport

246
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:01,654
or may just wave at each other sometimes you see, crossing each other,

247
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,917
or the children suffer the most.

248
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,765
And in that case the women also then take up with the men,

249
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:12,684
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

250
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,861
and in so doing so,

251
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,952
when they compete with each other,

252
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,801
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

253
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:24,271
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

254
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,267
her ego is not satisfied. In olden times

255
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,444
the man used to go in the jungle,

256
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:32,249
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

257
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:34,534
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

258
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:37,469
There was no problem because there was barter system.

259
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,516
He could see her working in the household.

260
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,411
Now the husband earns the money

261
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,426
and the woman spends. I mean that also requires some work,

262
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:46,834
isn't it to spend the money.

263
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:51,180
But to man it looks like, that I'm the earning member and she's the spender.

264
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:56,556
So she said all right, I will also earn. But in this too much of competition,

265
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,315
too much of competition like this, between the two,

266
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,746
what happens, the family suffers, the children suffer 

267
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:06,245
and such a person will have problem with the wife, the wife will have

268
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:10,937
problem with the husband and you can always feel that center on this finger,

269
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:14,298
if that finger is catching, that means there's something wrong

270
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,109
with your family relationship,

271
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,065
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

272
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,194
It's an important thing. Because you are like the flowers

273
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,241
which have to produce a fruit.

274
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:29,963
That's what nature wants.

275
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:32,881
Nature wants that you are there to produce the, 

276
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,901
fruit, that is your children.

277
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,343
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

278
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:44,478
Now, if you think that 

279
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:48,579
with that responsibility if you can do something else you should do.

280
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,217
But the main thing is that,

281
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:54,092
and if you don't do that, is to look after your children, to give them joy,

282
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:56,204
have a beautiful nest for them,

283
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,982
then I must say that you are neglecting your basic duty

284
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,482
and your attention is on something else.

285
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:06,530
That's why so many divorces are taking place and problems are there,

286
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,327
the women ask for their rights, they go beyond their limits,

287
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,022
they became dominating here, the men become dominating.

288
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:14,114
That's not the way we are going to solve it.

289
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,464
We have to know that we are two wheels,

290
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,511
two wheels of one chariot,

291
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,602
one on the left, another in the right.

292
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,822
Now they are not similar,

293
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:26,525
they're not similar they are two types one left side one right side.

294
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,874
But, they are equal.

295
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,272
In their, whatever they do it's equal,

296
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:35,513
they are to be respected equally in the same manner.

297
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,797
And it is always so for example,

298
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,709
I had a girl who came to me

299
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,993
and she was a private secretary,

300
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,299
and she told me: 'Mother you say this,

301
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:49,618
but I've seen that all these men come and flirt with their private secretaries.'

302
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:53,201
So I said: 'All right, maybe so, but what does that matter.'

303
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,132
You see that shows that's something wrong with the man, he

304
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,962
doesn't understand, he's off his head, he

305
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,422
cannot enjoy his wife and he's running after other things.

306
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,208
It's like having something in your house and you are

307
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,975
looking at other things you see.

308
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,542
Like in India if you go to some,

309
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,451
somebody comes to your house be careful about your things,

310
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,103
but in England I tell them, if somebody comes to your house

311
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,179
be careful about your wife, see.

312
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:19,061
Is just a little difference between,

313
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:22,202
but the second one is a dangerous thing because fundamental,

314
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,143
the wife is the fundamental thing,

315
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:27,362
because you do not know what she will do, how she will react

316
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:31,656
and you do not know how the guests because that is regarded as their freedom.

317
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:35,479
But if you take away something from somebody's house that's not freedom,

318
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,570
because we can take away anything from somebody's house

319
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,143
why should anybody arrest us?

320
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:42,558
Because there is a free will for you to do what you like,

321
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,824
is allowed to do what you like, but in that free will

322
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,566
you are harming so many people and ultimately your society.

323
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,817
Now these two wheels, as I said,

324
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,558
are very important to God,

325
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:00,693
because so many great people want to take birth on this earth.

326
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:04,840
So many great souls want to take birth on this earth,

327
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
and if we behave in such a manner,

328
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:11,641
that all the time this chariot is this way going up and that way going up,

329
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,343
I can tell you no child would be willing

330
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,768
to be born in this place who are great people.

331
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:21,166
Only the people who are of the worst type will be born,

332
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:25,731
they'll be hooligans, they'll be horrible people with a horrid nature

333
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:29,190
and they'll spoil the whole atmosphere of the countries

334
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:32,954
where husband wife have, do not have good relationship.

335
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,454
The children will be such hooligans

336
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:37,566
and such horrible things

337
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:42,299
that you'll be surprised that at the age of eight years and five years

338
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,171
they'll be committing murders and doing

339
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:46,881
all kinds of such thing that you'll be shocked.

340
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,588
Now between you and me,

341
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,387
because you are also husbands and wife and,

342
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,887
one thing it should be there that

343
00:19:56,387 --> 00:20:00,141
we should not quarrel before our children.

344
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,694
We should have all decency of husband and wife, there are so many things

345
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,935
we do not do in the presence of our children.

346
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,625
In the same way we need not sit down and

347
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,125
quarrel and say: 'I hate you and I hate you'.

348
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:16,543
I tell you this is something you have to change little bit in our language.

349
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:19,005
In India if somebody says: 'I hate you'

350
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,969
it's regarded, that man regarded as a most unmannerly person.

351
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:25,636
I mean its very bad manners to say 'I hate you' how,

352
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:29,024
I mean it shows that you are very low type of person to say like that.

353
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:30,726
But 'I hate you' so what.

354
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:33,226
If you hate so what, you are not God.

355
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,898
If you hate me what does it matter, actually,

356
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,570
if somebody hates someone, so what.

357
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:43,465
That shows that person is not a good person, just to hate someone.

358
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:47,600
'I hate you' is a way of expressing something

359
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:53,359
that is I feel, is very wrong for the family system. It shocks children.

360
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,821
Children look upon you as ideals.

361
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,724
When they are born you should see them,

362
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:01,935
most of the children nowadays in Australia are born realized,

363
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,293
I see them around when I went to the airport and I see they're born realized.

364
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,550
And they watch you, and they're surprised

365
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,658
and they sulk and they feel very sad.

366
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:11,485
They don't like, they don't take sides,

367
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,117
they don't like the father to fight the mother, the mother to fight.

368
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:18,280
And one other thing which you must understand,

369
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:20,780
that a certain gradation has to be there.

370
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,941
A woman is the strongest point of the household.

371
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:25,987
Like this Mother Earth is.

372
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,840
She takes all the problems upon Herself.

373
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:31,098
She, because She's the strongest.

374
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:35,176
Who else can withstand this kind of, weight on Her.

375
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:36,847
It's the Mother only can do that.

376
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,951
In the same way a woman in the house is the mother,

377
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,672
and she has to bear.

378
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,667
You see it's nice to have a husband

379
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:45,944
who comes home and says whatever he likes

380
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:48,034
and takes out all the filth on you,

381
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,982
than to have a husband who is very sweet, hello, hello

382
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:54,594
and outside he goes like a bumptious tiger on everyone.

383
00:21:55,896 --> 00:22:01,204
Such a man is, has to be, he has to, you see they're like children I would say,

384
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:05,559
they are like children. They have to take out their tensions on their wives only,

385
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,930
and you should be an absorber of that

386
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,531
and that's the sign of a woman.

387
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:13,136
A strong woman doesn't get easily disturbed by these things.

388
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,319
She's not bothered. She says all right,

389
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,708
you little baby come along,

390
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,266
now I have had four babies, now this is the fifth one

391
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:20,903
which is the smallest has come.

392
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:23,867
Let him shout and scream, even with the children,

393
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:26,831
you have to be patient, they'll hit you, they'll do anything.

394
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:29,425
I would say that way in India, children are treated

395
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,533
very kindly and they are special things.

396
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,830
They will do what they like when they are children,

397
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,517
but when they grow up we do not have teenage problem,

398
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,149
we do not have problem where the children don't respect.

399
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:42,078
In that, this is very important

400
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:45,252
aspect of our modern life

401
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:49,568
that we have to understand, what is the relationship of husband and wife is.

402
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:54,664
Husband is like say, a gentleman who

403
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:57,565
is definitely is to be respected by the wife.

404
00:22:57,617 --> 00:23:00,384
But if she does not respect the husband she cannot

405
00:23:00,474 --> 00:23:01,954
get respect from her children.

406
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,211
But the husband has to be respectable man,

407
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:07,708
that's very important. If the man is not respectable, he

408
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:09,310
cannot be respected easily.

409
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:12,441
But the more is the woman has to be very respectable,

410
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:15,165
if she doesn't give her respect,

411
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,366
you can handle any kind of man

412
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:21,807
if you are clever enough, drunkards, all sorts, they come round.

413
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:25,025
Because after all they're human beings, they're not bad people.

414
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:28,747
But because of mishandling they just get out

415
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:32,286
and the domination of men is just a myth.

416
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,750
See, they cannot dominate,

417
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,510
they're incapable of domination. They just do it because they want to

418
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:40,562
feel that they are superior, that's all.

419
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:43,840
But they cannot dominate. Whatever domination, what is their domination,

420
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,482
is little little things here and there.

421
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:47,609
Just like children, that's what it is.

422
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:51,295
If women understand their maturity and their,

423
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:55,431
their responsibility as women, because they are the shakti,

424
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:57,744
they are the power of the family,

425
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:03,088
and they are the potent shakti for the husband as well as for the children,

426
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,646
but if they get disturbed

427
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,494
then the husband is disturbed and children are also disturbed.

428
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:11,858
But they are potent, while the kinetics are these people.

429
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:13,948
Like here is the electricity, all right,

430
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,617
so we say very good, lamp and electricity and all that,

431
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:19,605
but from where does it come. The source is somewhere

432
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,751
quietly sending the source,

433
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,251
and enjoying itself by giving that source.

434
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,913
In the same way this is a very important centre.

435
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:30,365
Why I said it because today I went,

436
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:36,071
went to Melbourne and all the time this finger was burning up to this point.

437
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,328
So that means there's something wrong with

438
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:41,458
men and women as far as their family life is concerned.

439
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,396
They're all very upset I felt.

440
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,320
The husband is upset and the women.

441
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:48,088
Maybe the laws maybe against men, maybe here 

442
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,122
I don't know. But in America I found

443
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,899
a husband and wife relationship is very queer.

444
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,496
For example I met a lady, very queer people they are.

445
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,779
I went and stayed with a lady she had a luxurious house

446
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:04,318
with a swimming pool and this and that,

447
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:08,965
a maid in coming to do everything up and five storeys and this,

448
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:13,673
and she said: 'You see my, one of my former husbands 

449
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:17,844
will come and see you in Los Angeles.' I said: 'All right very good idea'.

450
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:21,742
So he came, he was like a pauper you know walking like this,

451
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:25,698
and he says: 'I have got a room on rents where I'm staying Mother,

452
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:28,768
 it's very difficult, I have to share it with someone'. I said: 'What?

453
00:25:29,473 --> 00:25:31,473
That lady who was there,

454
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:34,897
she has a very big house, she's supposed to be your wife'.

455
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:38,883
He said: 'That's mine, I tell you, I lost it to her in a case'.

456
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,271
I said: 'How could you lose that in a case?'

457
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,339
'Because she asked for a divorce and because

458
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,708
she found guilty out of me something some,

459
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:51,242
so she got it'. And she married three husbands, all the three husbands

460
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:54,114
are moving like paupers, and this lady's very rich.

461
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,779
If you marry seven husbands, seven husbands are finished forever

462
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:04,269
but the lady is so rich, seven times more than any one of them.

463
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:07,276
So this is kind of a law I don't understand.

464
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,687
First of all why there should be a law, I don't understand,

465
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:11,213
between husband and wife.

466
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,991
I just don't understand. I mean we don't have such laws in India but

467
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:16,895
everybody cares for the wife,

468
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:20,280
because she is the nearest and the dearest person they have.

469
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,425
Who else to depend? If the woman is dedicated and devoted to husband,

470
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:28,407
do you think he'll run after any other woman, he has to come back to her.

471
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:30,691
You see he'll be so fed up with these 

472
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:33,175
women who just live for money or anything

473
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:34,486
and he has to come back.

474
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,782
So you see one has to take a very wise decision,

475
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:40,743
because you must understand you are born at a juncture,

476
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:45,902
whether in, on which you will be destroyed completely,

477
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,790
or you'll be saved completely. Is a very important thing.

478
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,176
You have to save humanity. You are born

479
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,938
at a time when you have to save humanity.

480
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,944
It's not only kundalini awakening

481
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,297
that will help, because you might be saved,

482
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,164
but you have to save the whole society,

483
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,130
the whole family, the whole,

484
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,658
I should say the whole universe or the whole

485
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:12,729
creation will have no meaning if you people are destroyed.

486
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,616
Now you, this is one of the way of destruction,

487
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:18,701
 by destroying the family. The children become mad,

488
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:19,997
the husband becomes mad,

489
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:22,709
they all end up in orphanages, that's what I've seen,

490
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:25,036
they are mostly in orphanages in their old age, 

491
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,710
there's nobody to bother about you.

492
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:30,885
So it's a question of giving, and giving and giving.

493
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:36,516
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

494
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:40,445
and the another is Raja Laxshmi centre is on the right-hand side.

495
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:45,410
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

496
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:49,175
and we become very, in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

497
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:54,542
 and we can become very very, sort of authoritative and we might,

498
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:59,472
sort of end up with a funeral with ten thousand people behind us,

499
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:05,121
all bought from market and put there behind you without any feelings,

500
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:08,575
that's all finished. With such a man finished they'll say, oh thank God he died,

501
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:11,395
he was a horrible terror for us.

502
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,028
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

503
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,856
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

504
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:25,658
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance,

505
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,965
lead a very balanced life,

506
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,465
by which we are satisfied.

507
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:33,886
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi also one

508
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:36,880
should understand this power is a Lady,

509
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:41,132
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols

510
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,224
which suggest that,

511
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:49,237
these symbols are carved out with such deep significance.

512
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:54,195
She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

513
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:59,195
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus.

514
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:04,048
It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.

515
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:07,975
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car,

516
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,396
loudly, because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

517
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:17,698
and a rich man must go in a big limousine or some sort of

518
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:20,089
a thing to show off that he's very rich.

519
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,085
If he comes to any program, or any he must sit in front,

520
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:25,029
he should have the front seat,

521
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,581
and he makes him known everywhere everybody must feel

522
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:31,718
the weight of the rich man. He can run away with ten wives,

523
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,180
of somebody and, he can have a big

524
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,201
boat for himself, and he can get any number of women there

525
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,297
and he can spoil any families he likes because he's rich.

526
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:47,502
This kind of thing comes in in people but Laxshmi the One who has,

527
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:49,616
stands on the lotus,

528
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:54,462
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

529
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,976
that God has given that person.

530
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:02,719
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are

531
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:07,808
lotus flowers again. Now the lotus is regarded as a very

532
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:13,374
holy flower in India, because it is so receptive

533
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:18,687
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

534
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:22,120
it is born in the mud. Just think of it,

535
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,044
in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out,

536
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,347
the lotus is born.

537
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:33,444
And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance

538
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,723
to the whole atmosphere,

539
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:37,555
and kills all that's filth and everything,

540
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:41,057
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

541
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:44,067
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

542
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,678
That's what is the lotus for. But this lotus

543
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:53,743
is a pink lotus, means pink, you know is the sign of love.

544
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:57,450
Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have

545
00:30:57,628 --> 00:31:00,977
tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.

546
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:04,810
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice

547
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:10,233
and a, I don't know what do you call that, the bee, the black bee,

548
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:15,491
a very big one which has got horrible,

549
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:20,989
no, the black bee, it's like that, which has got

550
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:24,554
angular legs and things like that, horrible, you cannot touch it.

551
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:28,050
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

552
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:32,771
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals and takes it inside

553
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:37,759
and makes it, sleep on the corona that it has, very soft

554
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,192
one on the bed, and covers it nicely

555
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,804
and gives it a nice, you see,

556
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:47,692
swinging feeling, that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

557
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:52,414
and it sleeps off. Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

558
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:57,195
Now the man who is a laxshmipati the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

559
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:00,154
has to have a temperament like that.

560
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:02,288
Anybody who comes to his house,

561
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:08,311
anyone, should be very readily accepted. I've seen people like that,

562
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,228
I've seen in my lifetime, should be accepted and they should be

563
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:15,557
very gratified to have such people in the house

564
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,312
and should feel that oh God,

565
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,233
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

566
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:23,970
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

567
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,084
how to avoid guests,

568
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,826
guests are equal to pests.

569
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:35,897
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills and

570
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,869
we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

571
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:40,591
quite good bungalows I should say, there were seven bungalows.

572
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,618
And poor husbands were taken to tasks

573
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,766
for mowing the lawns and everything and the wife used to

574
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,449
tell them now come along do it properly

575
00:32:47,606 --> 00:32:48,919
and the polishing of the,

576
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,099
brass whatever was there and everything was done very well.

577
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:55,484
But I didn't see even a rat enter those houses,

578
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,284
even a rat, I mean leave alone human beings.

579
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:02,540
Nothing entered those houses, only these two persons used to come out

580
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,544
and go in.

581
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,976
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

582
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:09,197
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

583
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:14,345
But nobody, while My house was naturally, I am like this,

584
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:18,650
so it was open all the time, people would come in and go out and this and that

585
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:20,785
and I was just enjoying their company.

586
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:21,909
And one day they asked me,

587
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,477
what's the matter in Your house, all the time people are

588
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:27,787
coming and going and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

589
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:31,663
I said nothing, just they come, have tea and go, that's all, just

590
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:34,522
some talk together, some rapport of love.

591
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:36,506
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

592
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,552
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

593
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:44,380
and they are, they like to be together, there is a togetherness in them.

594
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:48,577
But with all this, if you cannot have togetherness,

595
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:50,668
to enjoy your wealth with others,

596
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,653
then what's the use of all the wealth.

597
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:54,808
If you have wealth, you'll go for horse-racing,

598
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,702
that's also your own enjoyment.

599
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,314
If you have wealth you will do something else which is so individualistic.

600
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,403
You cannot enjoy your wealth

601
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,473
unless and until you share it.

602
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,714
As I told you the other day that

603
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:11,382
I am, a capitalist in the sense I have all the powers within myself.

604
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:15,429
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

605
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:18,527
so I am the greatest communist, because I just cannot enjoy,

606
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,922
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

607
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,309
and today my husband was so insistent that I should come back soon,

608
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:27,917
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still, and then I'll come.'

609
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:31,641
So unless and until you share this love after realization,

610
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:34,231
you do not enjoy. All isms drop out, 

611
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:36,967
because you become combination of both extremes,

612
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:40,349
and you just start enjoying yourself.

613
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:42,569
Now this lotus is in the hand

614
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:47,002
and another hand that the Goddess has is like this. She has four hands,

615
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,296
and one hand like this.

616
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,559
Now this hand that is like this means,

617
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:57,535
you see with this we must give, we must give, we must be generous.

618
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:01,478
Miserly people cannot be the blessed ones,

619
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:06,180
they cannot be. Miserly rich is the horridest thing that you could think of.

620
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,551
Mean, if you see a miserly person,

621
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:12,684
I mean, I don't know, I get a headache with a man like that, you see, who

622
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:14,945
goes on counting each and every pi 

623
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:18,176
and measuring everything, you see miserly horrible things

624
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,894
and ultimately when they die, their children

625
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,243
take out all their money and just spend it over.

626
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:28,451
They have, miserly people have another way of 

627
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:30,498
getting their money looted. For example

628
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:34,207
a thief might come in, if not thief then,

629
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,276
their children will become very wayward

630
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:37,785
or something will happen,

631
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:41,413
they will get sick and they'll have hand brokens and

632
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,204
feet broken or something, and they will have to spend money.

633
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:49,221
So the miserly people are such a nuisance to the society.

634
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,640
They give nothing to the society they are

635
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:54,967
there for themselves and they are just malignant personalities.

636
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:57,467
The people who give,

637
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,341
not of course I don't believe into giving

638
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:03,381
into somebody freely because that also can spoil people.

639
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,038
If you give something to someone very freely,

640
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:09,085
they can be completely spoilt and,

641
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:12,384
they would not know how to use that money.

642
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,755
This is the trouble with human beings is,

643
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,889
that they cannot bear anything.

644
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:18,138
If you give them money,

645
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:20,812
either they'll become miserly or they become wayward.

646
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:24,250
If you give them power either they become dictatorial

647
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,621
or they become destroyers.

648
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:30,089
I mean, you cannot give anything to human beings

649
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,414
without realization.

650
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:34,002
Anything they get extreme, they become mad.

651
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:36,136
That's one word you can explain.

652
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:39,526
Now Krishna has said, 'yoga kshema mahatmyam'.

653
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,748
He has said I give you Yoga,

654
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,275
that is union with God, self-realization,

655
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,780
and then I look after your kshema,

656
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:50,956
and kshema means your well-being.

657
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,166
This well-being is brought forth with this Laxshmi,

658
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:57,214
with one hand that is giving, the another is the protection.

659
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,700
This hand which gives, should not, the other hand should not know.

660
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,748
It should be so done so gracefully, graciously.

661
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,443
Today only I was telling the story to some people,

662
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:10,137
about my own father,

663
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:13,544
who was a very generous man I've ever known.

664
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,703
And he had a habit on a Sunday afternoon he used to go,

665
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,714
he used to call all the people and say that I have to

666
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,085
give away lots of things, I have too many things in the house.

667
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:25,628
He'd take out all the blankets, sometimes all the

668
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,918
utensils and sometimes food, anything that he felt like he used to give way.

669
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:34,526
So people would come and he would pass on and his head was bent like that,

670
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:37,026
and some people told him, what's the use, some people are

671
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:39,313
taking three blankets, some are taking two blankets,

672
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:42,473
you don't even see what's happening you are just giving away,

673
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,413
please at least raise your head.

674
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:46,305
So he said: 'The problem is like this,

675
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:48,439
because I don't give, it's God Who is giving,

676
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:49,915
I'm just standing in between.

677
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,192
And they all are saying that

678
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,369
you are giving you are giving, thank you, thank you.

679
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
So I feel very shy, first of all.

680
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,829
And secondly it is the lookout of God who is giving these things

681
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:01,501
to see whether one gets two or one. Why should I bother.

682
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,571
I'm just standing in between, I'm not supposed to see who takes two or one.'

683
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:08,912
Such generosity I've seen, in my own lifetime.

684
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:11,902
And I have seen, the more generous he was,

685
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,813
the more generosity flew into our house.

686
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:19,176
I mean, that like if you open this door from the other side it starts flowing.

687
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:22,507
But some people have sixty shirts, but still they'll go

688
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,252
to the market and buy shirts.

689
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:26,364
And they'll say: 'Oh I have a weakness for shirts.'

690
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:28,648
Now I don't understand this weakness

691
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,974
of heaping up shirts after shirts.

692
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,711
It is ridiculous, isn't it.

693
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:37,385
Some of these things really are ridiculous,

694
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:38,870
that I have a weakness for shoes,

695
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:41,481
now you go and see the shoes are from top to bottom,

696
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:44,964
you can open a shoe shop, or,

697
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:48,950
it's like that, what's the use of getting so many shoes

698
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:52,540
because your foot has got the same size for years now,

699
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:55,177
it's not going to change, even after realization.

700
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:59,948
So there is no need to, I mean if your shoes give way is all right

701
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:03,769
but, I too have the same problem. That

702
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:08,140
I, My disciples know that they should give me a shoe, I don't know why,

703
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,492
they give me a shoe, all the time I go there they give me

704
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,605
chappal or a shoe or something. I said now

705
00:39:12,631 --> 00:39:13,963
I've too many now what to do?

706
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,765
They said: 'Mother return it to us we'll keep it for vibrations.'

707
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,334
I said: 'That's a good idea,' because I have no place

708
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:22,071
to keep all these shoes, I mean I am not a cobbler,

709
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,727
I cannot do anything with it.

710
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:25,365
So it is useless.

711
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,025
Best thing is to give flowers

712
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:31,398
so that I can again send them back to some ocean or to some river.

713
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:35,026
So even in there, when we go on accumulating,

714
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:37,698
and I must have this, you go to the shop the people are

715
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:41,158
like this like this, watching everything. What is there to watch.

716
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:45,197
You see whatever you want to buy you go in the shop see what you like, you have it.

717
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:47,288
But sort of I must have this, I must have that.

718
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:51,502
I have known a person who had ten ironing boards

719
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,934
and twenty iron in his house. All locked up.

720
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:56,162
I said: 'For whom?'

721
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:59,459
So she said: 'Maybe my children.' I said: 'You have only one child,

722
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:01,226
God has been very miserly about you,

723
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:04,839
you have only one child. And now what are you going to do with this?

724
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:07,611
You'd better throw them away.' And with the electrical

725
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:10,258
I mean appliances you know they go off and all that.

726
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,199
But she would not.

727
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:13,854
She could not, she used show everyone: 'See now I've got it.'

728
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,721
Not antiques, all modern stuff, you see.

729
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:19,647
And this is how the things go on accumulating

730
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:22,469
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

731
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:26,370
Actually you should buy something only to give it to someone.

732
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:30,864
That's the best way of enjoying it to the maximum, you see.

733
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:32,977
And anybody likes it - have it.

734
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:35,017
You see, that's the best way.

735
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:38,662
It's a great thing, I mean I tell you it's rather difficult for you people

736
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,660
to understand but I am one of them Wwho does that

737
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:46,265
very often, and my children and my husband are rather worried you know,

738
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:49,204
God knows next time what She'll give away.

739
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:52,035
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

740
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,852
so many things, despite all this,

741
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:56,911
I mean the whole time thinking what to give to whom,

742
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,376
still it's so many things in the house, now that we have to take a bigger house.

743
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:03,690
I don't know what to do with so many things

744
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:07,880
and I try to thrust things on the people, Baba you take this you have liked it.

745
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
But they say: 'No no no how can you give me.'

746
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,890
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

747
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,390
and one must learn how to do.

748
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,578
But I've have seen human beings are different.

749
00:41:17,654 --> 00:41:19,654
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

750
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:23,089
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

751
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:24,963
It's very common you know.

752
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:27,021
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

753
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,711
and when it is coming to giving to others they'll give artificial.

754
00:41:29,772 --> 00:41:32,211
At least don't wear at that time the diamond,

755
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,416
at least that much decency should be there.

756
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:38,417
So you see when it comes to giving, give it with your full heart.

757
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,917
You just feel that love of giving

758
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:45,704
and you feel so happy, because you feel so big about yourself,

759
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:49,293
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

760
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,348
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, and again making it into clouds,

761
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:58,380
a sort of a circle of beautiful conversion into beauty

762
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,866
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

763
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:04,302
And that's what we should try to become,

764
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,758
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

765
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,579
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

766
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:16,644
And this is what it is, and this hand is for ashraya, means for the protection.

767
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:22,153
You must protect the people who are your subordinates,

768
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,014
who are dependent on you, your children.

769
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:29,248
Like, it's a very common thing to insult your children from their childhood.

770
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:31,748
Why did you spoil that carpet?

771
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:35,048
Why did you do that? You should not have said this,

772
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,570
why did you? This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

773
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:42,281
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

774
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:46,667
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

775
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:50,520
is known by the way children are addressed in the family.

776
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:56,423
Like, in a good family we address the children like sa.

777
00:42:56,593 --> 00:43:02,725
Little bit like that, ap, means sa. We never address the children with indignity,

778
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:05,447
and we put them on a dignified level.

779
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:11,258
And it's a very nice thing. I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

780
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:18,820
that, somebody was telling her one day that, there's a very, this boy

781
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:22,577
and why don't you marry him. She said: 'Why do you want to talk about marriage?

782
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:26,176
I'm not yet grown at all to think about marriage,

783
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,070
and we have to be dignified about things,

784
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:32,251
how can we think of marriage when we are not to think,

785
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:37,040
and my grandmother will marry me and I want to live, a dignified person.'

786
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:41,242
A little girl of seven years said this to this woman who was very,

787
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:44,394
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

788
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:48,252
to tease my granddaughter. She said: 'It's not dignified'.

789
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,871
Just think of that. At the age of seven years they have their sense of dignity.

790
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:56,815
If you tell them, you see they, you need not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

791
00:43:56,987 --> 00:44:00,439
but give them dignity they will never spoil it. You'll be surprised.

792
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:04,123
Because we all the time cut them short, they become so bad.

793
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:07,205
They want to, they think we are good for nothing, we don't know

794
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,105
what to do, all the time they're telling us like this.

795
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:13,125
Or even if you have to tell them, tell about somebody else,

796
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:15,961
like that boy, you know, he was absolutely

797
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,819
useless, he didn't know what to do,

798
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:20,379
he spoiled the whole carpet, I went to his house and slipped down.

799
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:22,285
The child immediately gets the thing.

800
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,977
But directly all the time hitting the child,

801
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,121
you see gives him a personality

802
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:29,326
which does not hold,

803
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,826
anything substantial within.

804
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,718
He might later on became a very arrogant person taking a cue from his parents,

805
00:44:35,862 --> 00:44:37,628
and he may behave the same manner,

806
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:39,505
but he would not be that dignity

807
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,521
which just is silent and is expressing and manifesting.

808
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,603
It should be a silent dignity which just manifests,

809
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,687
and when people see such a person,

810
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:53,571
it happens, people see and say 'Oh what a man, what a dignity'.

811
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:57,869
You see that's what, and they become sort of ideals for society.

812
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:01,982
I think this, correcting the children is not the way,

813
00:45:02,096 --> 00:45:05,329
it is not disciplining, but it is making them grow.

814
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,458
What we have to give to our children is the joy,

815
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,730
is happiness of the family, is the complete security,

816
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:16,054
a sense of complete security

817
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:18,622
and you will see you'll never have teenage problems,

818
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:20,943
never have teenage problem.

819
00:45:21,027 --> 00:45:23,027
You'll be surprised you put them anywhere,

820
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,686
they'll be so dignified and so mature, that people will be amazed.

821
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:32,184
You won't have to tell them. Even small little children I've seen,

822
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:34,597
if you keep your house very clean,

823
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:39,231
and also always look after it, children themselves will keep it clean.

824
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:41,994
They would like to do. Because children are

825
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:46,397
really the budding beauties.

826
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:49,981
When we cut them we cut them at the root.

827
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:52,222
They expect so much from us you see,

828
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,910
they lose all their dignity

829
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:56,094
and I'll tell you try this with your children,

830
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:59,631
give them dignity, you will be amazed how they behave.

831
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:01,670
We say they are spoilt, I've never see

832
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:04,061
children being spoilt when they are dignified.

833
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:08,039
Like my own grandson is a realized soul who's a very great person and

834
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:10,824
all his friends are above twenty-five years,

835
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:13,983
you see he's just a five six year old boy and

836
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:16,981
he doesn't like to wear any dress which has got

837
00:46:17,136 --> 00:46:19,885
funny faces and all that He says:

838
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
'This is like a clown, I'm not a clown,

839
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:25,663
I don't want to wear'. I found it very difficult in Singapore to buy

840
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:26,980
a pant for him

841
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:28,681
which didn't have any funny faces,

842
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:31,481
because all of them had Mickey Mouse this that.

843
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:34,121
And I've seen my grandchildren also,

844
00:46:34,276 --> 00:46:38,286
daughters, there these dolls with, you see this ducky

845
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:41,429
what you call the duck sort of a face you see.

846
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:43,994
They said: 'What's wrong with these dolls,

847
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,168
they should know how to put their lips. This is not good.'

848
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:50,492
I mean you see, they themselves know, that this is wrong.

849
00:46:50,647 --> 00:46:54,235
'She's going to go into tantrums.' That's what they say.

850
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:57,353
This duck is going to go into tantrums

851
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:59,307
that's why she is behaving like this,

852
00:46:59,347 --> 00:47:03,590
oh like that, you see they are great-grandmothers sometimes the way they

853
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:06,419
do some things and the way they behave.

854
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,574
But we must give them

855
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:11,389
real love and joy and happiness,

856
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:13,717
that's the thing we can give to our children

857
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:18,107
and you'll be amazed that this Australia is going to be blessed with children

858
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:21,438
who are very great saints,

859
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,710
very very great saints. I know that,

860
00:47:23,836 --> 00:47:28,072
and you have to look after them with dignity.

861
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:32,039
Very great saints are going to be born in this country,

862
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,756
so I have to request to you, that forget your problems,

863
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:40,121
husband wife problem, is nothing. Look after your children,

864
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:43,725
give them dignity, give them a nest where they could live,

865
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:46,494
forget because I've seen in England I've seen

866
00:47:46,592 --> 00:47:49,372
even an eighty-year old woman behaves like a bride

867
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,754
I mean she doesn't get over her feeling that she was a bride.

868
00:47:52,823 --> 00:47:54,968
Like one of the 'Great Expectations'

869
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,925
you must have read of Charles Dickens where there was a bride

870
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,226
who was sitting all the time thinking she was a bride.

871
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:02,002
I see that picture even today,

872
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:04,098
all the time they are in bridal mood.

873
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,541
You see you are a mother and you have to treat your children with that dignity

874
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:11,341
and with that love that a mother should give.

875
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:14,235
It is very difficult for some people

876
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:16,156
to accept the position of a mother,

877
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,281
they think why women should be the mothers.

878
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:23,812
I said this is the greatest things look at me. Look at me.

879
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:27,097
This is the greatest thing to be the mother,

880
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:30,189
to love everyone, that they depend on you for

881
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:33,444
love and guidance, just for love.

882
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:36,379
Such a great thing to feel: 'Oh God

883
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:40,732
see how much I can give, how many cups I can fill,'

884
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,030
it's such a great feeling,

885
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:46,989
I wish you would know what a mother is and the,

886
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,294
motherhood you have to learn from your children and grandchildren and expand it

887
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,140
to the whole universe. It's such a great thing a woman has in the same way

888
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:59,054
the father has to do a lot of things about which I will tell you

889
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:00,795
when we go to the other center.

890
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,859
I think I've talked at length on this center because

891
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:07,181
all the time what I find these two centers are catching

892
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:09,306
very much in Australia.

893
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:13,803
So we have to talk about the things that are catching on this and this.

894
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:17,635
And today I saw there five six children with their both the fingers in,

895
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,540
all realized children with those fingers they were sucking, 

896
00:49:20,636 --> 00:49:22,636
and they were showing me again sucking like that.

897
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:24,819
So you can imagine how much it is,

898
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:28,322
and otherwise this one and this means that

899
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:31,527
you have been going to some unauthorized personality.

900
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:35,818
If you are going to some unauthorized personality this thumb will be caught up,

901
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:39,842
that's why children put their things in their mouths and

902
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:42,342
Freud has his own nonsensical theory,

903
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:46,312
but actually it is the center that is catching

904
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:49,077
with these born-realized children are showing you.

905
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:54,608
Now for today, I may not be able to cover other

906
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,754
centers so much, but later on,

907
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:59,762
what is the date we are having the program now?

908
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,215
Next Monday Wednesday Friday,

909
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:08,079
three days are there out of which I will cover all these centers

910
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:10,790
and specially that of Christ I would like to speak,

911
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:14,513
because I met some people, when I went to America

912
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,398
I was telling the people there

913
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:18,125
that you are to be born again,

914
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:21,311
you are to be born again and you must have your realization,

915
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:24,489
so what I found whatever lecture I gave there were big big,

916
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:28,626
much bigger than these you see, they had brought to tape

917
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:32,715
all my speeches, and the people who organized my program told me that:

918
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:36,942
'Mother you'd better get it patented or don't allow them to tape it.'

919
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,137
I said: 'Why?' They said: 'They will be publishing these are all writers

920
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:42,005
and this I said: 'Very good let them write.'

921
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:46,824
But some of them started an organization called 'born again', imagine.

922
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:49,848
Now if I said you have to be,

923
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,287
then you start an organization that we are already self-certificated.

924
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:57,411
You see it's a thing one should understand you are to be born again.

925
00:50:57,473 --> 00:51:02,206
Now Christ has said that you will be born through Me. Is a fact.

926
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:06,962
Where is Christ, is here. This is the gate, see the narrow gate

927
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:10,193
and your kundalini has to pass through that.

928
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:14,315
Now in case it does not pass you have to say Lord's Prayer.

929
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:16,547
You have to take the name of Christ

930
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:18,562
and you have to adore Him,

931
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:22,984
then only it passes through, shows that you have passed through Christ.

932
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:26,646
You enter into the kingdom of God which is the,

933
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:29,802
limbic area. So, it's a fact

934
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:32,302
when He said you have to pass through Me

935
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:35,478
He didn't mean that people who are self-certificated

936
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:37,565
can say that: 'All right this is Christ,

937
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:41,131
this is Bible this is Christ,' as if Christ is somewhere lying there,

938
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,266
you just have to turn a stone and you get Him there.

939
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:47,749
Christ is here. How do you approach Him is only

940
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:51,276
through the kundalini awakening and it passes through Christ.

941
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:52,573
This is the door.

942
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,672
Now say, you are all Christians or maybe you are Jews or whatever it is,

943
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:59,378
but, in India for example

944
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:02,608
they have a very antagonistic feelings towards Christianity.

945
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,108
Now even a Hindu, or a Muslim,

946
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:10,542
if he denies he says all right I don't believe in Christ. He has to.

947
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,750
I have to tell him that: 'See,

948
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:15,990
if you don't believe in Christ I cannot give you realization.

949
00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:18,222
You have to ask for forgiveness,

950
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,459
and you have to request Christ, then only this will pass through.

951
00:52:21,594 --> 00:52:24,396
Now there may be Jews or Christians,

952
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:27,499
any type, they have to know that all of them are here.

953
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:31,122
For example there was a doctor who came from,

954
00:52:31,257 --> 00:52:34,542
Tehran to see me, he had cancer,

955
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:38,112
and he came to see me, he had this cancer of the stomach,

956
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:42,755
so I told him that: 'Do you believe that Mohammed Sahib was the same

957
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:46,753
as Dattatreya or Nanaka?' He said: 'No I don't even believe,

958
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,864
when you say that He was Moses or Abraham.

959
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:51,364
I said: 'He was Moses Abraham

960
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,694
and they are very powerful personality.

961
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:55,829
Unless and until you accept,

962
00:52:56,016 --> 00:52:58,329
that He was Moses and Abraham,

963
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:00,829
you are not going to get it.

964
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,702
He said: 'Ah, I cannot say that,' because Jews and Muslims are like this.

965
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,545
I said they both are the same they are very great personalities,

966
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:10,632
you are just fighting for nothing at all.

967
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:15,751
I know Who is Moses and I know Who is, Abraham.

968
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:19,952
But he would not accept, for eight days, then his wife, you know

969
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:23,027
she was wiser, she said you'd better get it, you are not well,

970
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:25,585
you'll die, better get it, then they came.

971
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:28,334
You see this is what happens, they are just compelled.

972
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:31,501
He came: 'All right Mother what ever you say I will accept.' I said: 'Not that,

973
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:34,714
from your heart you have to say,' and he was cured,

974
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:36,776
for your information he was cured.

975
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,887
So do not have any extreme ideas,

976
00:53:38,974 --> 00:53:41,785
They are all in there, and They are all One.

977
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:46,050
Only we are fighting saying this is mine, that is mine,

978
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:49,356
so this is I have just hinted that this center because I think

979
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:51,295
that's a very important center

980
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:54,837
as I have discussed with the void, about all these Abraham,

981
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:58,171
Moses and all the Old Testament, which is so important.

982
00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:01,893
How, and how Christ is the One, Who,

983
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,773
stays there, Who crucified Himself, to make a path

984
00:54:05,835 --> 00:54:09,327
for us to pass through, why His crucifixion was necessary.

985
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:13,427
So I'll spend more time on that later on. I hope

986
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:17,939
you'll make it convenient to come again, and I hope you'll get a better hall,

987
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,670
they are feeling very warm here. Thank you very much.
