1
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Today we are going to have the Puja of Shri Krishna.

2
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,320
In Shri Krishna’s life,

3
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,320
the River Yamuna has played a very great role.

4
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,960
The Yamuna River is a very deep river

5
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,320
and the water has a blue color,

6
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
which they say Shri Krishna also had,

7
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,840
while the River Ganges flows faster

8
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,120
and much shallower than this river.

9
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,360
Next year maybe we might go to Allahabad,

10
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,400
might be able to see the two rivers meet.

11
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,920
The whole of Haryana

12
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,720
has been a very, very historical, mythological place.

13
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,480
You must have known about it

14
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,680
that Pandavas and Kauravas fought in Kurukshetra

15
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,600
and also all this area has been

16
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,080
used since long for meditation.

17
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Markandeya, whose name you have heard many a times,

18
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,800
meditated in this area.

19
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,920
First, he was in Maharashtra,

20
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,800
where you have seen the Sapta Shringhi.

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,040
And after that, he came down here and meditated

22
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,320
and wrote his treatise.

23
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,280
Everywhere you find a place of a pir.

24
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Also they are realized souls who have been respected till today.

25
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,760
To begin with, we have to say that this is the

26
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,640
area of great spirituality,

27
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,640
because Shri Krishna lived here.

28
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,920
And, in those days there were no cars,

29
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
not this transport.

30
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,520
So he has vibrated all this land so beautifully.

31
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
Very fond of playing near the River Yamuna.

32
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Of course, his childhood was not spent here.

33
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,240
But later on when he became the king

34
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,880
he used to visit this place many a times.

35
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,360
We have to understand his character in a very special way.

36
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,600
First, we had the incarnation of Shri Rama.

37
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,200
The Vishnu, as you know, took the birth of

38
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,080
Shri Rama.

39
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,680
But Shri Rama forgot his divinity.

40
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,440
He was made to forget his divinity,

41
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,200
and he lived like an ordinary person,

42
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,040
became a king

43
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,720
like Socrates has described, the benevolent king.

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,440
And he had to also sacrifice his wife.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,120
That’s very symbolic, no doubt.

46
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,440
The other part of north India we’ll be able to see his

47
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,080
vibrated areas where he moved.

48
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,840
But Maharashtra he went without shoes,

49
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,440
walked and walked and walked.

50
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,680
Thus, this whole country is really vibrated by great saints

51
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,480
and by great incarnations.

52
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,000
Shri Krishna’s one side was that he was like a child,

53
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
and he wanted to

54
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,480
create an atmosphere of mirth, of joy,

55
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,320
because at the time of Shri Rama,

56
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,880
after him the religion was taken very seriously

57
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,600
and people started doing very serious type of religion.

58
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,600
The same incarnation again reappeared, Shri Krishna.

59
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,560
And Shri Krishna wanted to show that

60
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,320
spirituality is not serious; it’s “Leela”.

61
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,080
It’s a game that you have to play.

62
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,760
And in his lifetime he showed.

63
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
People don’t understand him at all,

64
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,440
because from Shri Rama’s concept he cannot condescend,

65
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,360
to come down to the, sometimes,

66
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,840
to the level of Shri Krishna which was, I think, was much higher.

67
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,120
Because he had to show that all this,

68
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,000
all this world, is just a joke, is Maya,

69
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,520
and beyond that is joy.

70
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,480
His whole style was very interesting.

71
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,920
That time they couldn’t have such beautiful pendals,

72
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,240
they couldn’t have so many disciples,

73
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,720
so he tried on his own style.

74
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,080
And his style was, when he was a child,

75
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,720
there were many milk maid whom they called “gopis”.

76
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,640
They would be taking their bath in the River Yamuna, not here.

77
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,800
He would just break their water pitcher

78
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,800
and the water would flow on their back.

79
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,000
This Yamuna River was vibrated by Radhaji.

80
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Radha: “Ra” means energy; “Dha” means the one who sustains.

81
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,520
Radha - Dhara iti sada - Radha.

82
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,120
And he

83
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,960
didn’t know how to tell them about Kundalini.

84
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,360
So he used to throw stones, small stones,

85
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,520
at those pitchers and the water would flow down their backbone,

86
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,200
thus giving them the blessings of the Kundalini.

87
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
His style was extremely, extremely

88
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,280
simple, playful, mirthful,

89
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,360
and nobody understood why he was doing all these things.

90
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,680
Also, when he was a very small child,

91
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
there were ladies who were taking their baths.

92
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,840
So he was trying to raise their Kundalini and he hid their clothes;

93
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
he vibrated them.

94
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,280
So, many people don’t understand a little child; he’s so innocent.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,520
And he was teasing them, and tried to show

96
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,640
that life is nothing but joy.

97
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,040
And he then he gave them those clothes.

98
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Later on, he grew up.

99
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,200
Then he became the king of Dwarika.

100
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,440
In our country there are very westernized intellectuals,

101
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,480
and they try to say that there were two Shri Krishnas.

102
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
I mean, they want to analyze everything

103
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,040
without understanding spirituality,

104
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,120
what is the subtle thing behind it.

105
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,200
There was, he had sixteen thousand wives, as they say.

106
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,400
They were his powers. You see, for men - I am a Mother.

107
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,120
I can have thousands of children: boys, girls, men, women.

108
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,480
Nobody can say anything about my character.

109
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,000
But for men it is very difficult.

110
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
So he got all his powers born as women

111
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,520
who were married to some king.

112
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,160
Not married; actually he had abducted those women

113
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
and put them in jail.

114
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,480
So he saved them from there,

115
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,000
brought them out, and married them.

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,360
Now the, if you see the accent is on marriage.

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,600
He married these women with sixteen thousand powers.

118
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,320
As you know, he is sixteen petals and one thousand

119
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,080
of the Sahasrara is sixteen thousand powers which he married.

120
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Then he had five wives, for which also people have objections.

121
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Only Krishna can do like that.

122
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,680
Five wives are the five elements.

123
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,240
The essence of them, the essence of them, the causal of them,

124
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,480
came as his wives and he married them.

125
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,320
But he was such a detached soul.

126
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,120
There’s lot of stories about his detachment.

127
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,240
There was one great rishi,

128
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,640
meaning a saint or sage,

129
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,880
who had arrived on the other side of the River Yamuna.

130
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,320
This was in Dwarika.

131
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,720
And, there was no Yamuna River,

132
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,840
but there was also, there was Narmada and Tapti,

133
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,640
and they wanted to go and serve the sage.

134
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,160
So when they went near the river,

135
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
they found the river was all flooded.

136
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,960
So they went back to Shri Krishna and said,

137
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,240
“See, we are going to worship the sage

138
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,200
and the river is all flooded.”

139
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
So he said, “All right, you go and tell the river a truth.

140
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
By that truth it will go down.”

141
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,640
“What’s the truth?”

142
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,840
“That Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya, is a celibate person.”

143
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,960
He had five wives.

144
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,600
They said, “How can we say this?”

145
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,040
"This is the truth” he said. “You go and tell him. Tell the river,

146
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,960
and river will understand the truth.

147
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,720
The power of truth will put down the floods.”

148
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,800
So they went and they said that, “Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya,”

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,480
and the river went down.  And they were surprised.

150
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,520
“How it can happen? This fellow is our husband,

151
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,680
and how can he say that he is a Brahmacharya?”

152
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,240
So they served the sage, served him well,

153
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,920
gave him food,

154
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,480
looked after him, and

155
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,000
when they came back they again saw the river was again in floods.

156
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,080
So they were quite worried how to cross the river now.

157
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,720
So then went back to the sage and informed the sage

158
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,680
that, “See, we have to go back and there the river is

159
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,960
in speed and we don’t know how to cross over.”

160
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,440
He said, “It’s very easy. If you want to go, it’s very easy.”

161
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
They said, “How?”

162
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,160
“How did you come?”

163
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,080
They said, “We told, Krishna told us like this to tell

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,680
that the river is celibate,

165
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,920
that, that, ‘I am celibate. I am celibate.

166
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,440
And the river, she’s also – Narmada is also a celibate river.

167
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,440
So the river went down.”

168
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,840
“All right, then you go and tell the river now

169
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,600
that I didn’t eat any food. Nothing I ate.

170
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
I am just fasting.”

171
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,400
They said, “This fellow ate like a glutton,

172
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,960
and telling us a lie like this,

173
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,640
and how are we to believe this man?”

174
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,040
So, they went to the river and to the river they said that,

175
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,640
“This sage didn’t eat any food - he is on a fast -

176
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,400
and please go down.” And the river went down.

177
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,320
So they were surprised, how this fellow has eaten everything

178
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,280
and despite that, when we told it, it’s a big lie.

179
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,640
This river has listened to this lie.

180
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,280
So they crossed over.

181
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,440
The point is, those people who are at that level,

182
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,440
even when they eat they don’t eat.

183
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,320
Even they are married, they are celibate. It’s a state.

184
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,840
It’s a state in which you are completely detached,

185
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,040
absolutely detached.

186
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,160
You don’t feel the attachment of the work you are doing,

187
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,760
or the life you are leading.

188
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,480
I cannot say how one should become detached.

189
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,520
Of course, with the Kundalini working out and

190
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,240
you meditating, all that, and

191
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,000
fixing the Kundalini properly, it will work out.

192
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,520
You will be amazed how you will become detached about things

193
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,640
and how you can manage

194
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,080
things without feeling that you are doing it,

195
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,200
how you can work out so many things without feeling even tired.

196
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,520
It’s, it's a state. And that is the state one has to achieve.

197
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,240
Now for that, whether you are at that stage or not,

198
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,400
first thing you must notice how many times

199
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,920
I use the word, “‘I”, “me”.

200
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,440
How many times I said,

201
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,520
“I saw this, I enjoyed this, I this, I that?”

202
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,000
Or, “This is my child. This is my house,” something like that.

203
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,120
When you start using “I” too much,

204
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,160
then you are not detached.

205
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,080
Try to introspect. How many times I say,

206
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,760
“I have got this.

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,680
work to be done I’ve got to do this.

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,000
I must furnish this. I must achieve this.

209
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,120
This is the goal of my life.”?

210
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,080
These are all words of illusion.

211
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,000
Once you get detached, it’s a state, again I say. I won’t say that,

212
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
“By standing on your head you will become detached,”

213
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,160
or anything like that. It’s a state into which one has to grow.

214
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,440
So Shri Krishna’s message, all his life, was complete detachment.

215
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,280
Even when he went with Arjuna for a war,

216
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,120
he said, “I will be just the driver of your chariot.

217
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,040
But I will not raise any weapons. I will not fight.

218
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,760
I will be just your charioteer,

219
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,160
and if you agree to that condition, I’ll be there.”

220
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,600
Actually, when Arjuna had a question,

221
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,200
“How can I kill? These are my relations, these are my gurus,

222
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,480
these are my, my close people, my friends.

223
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,280
How can I kill them?”

224
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,000
And he became very depressed.

225
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,360
When he became depressed, Krishna said,

226
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,960
that “Do you know they are already dead?

227
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Anything that is born has to die.

228
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,040
So, you have to kill them.”

229
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,680
Now people can say that Krishna was preaching violence.

230
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
No, not that.

231
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,520
But what he said at those people

232
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
who are adharmies [GW: adharmics?],

233
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,240
who have no sense of dharma, who have been so cruel,

234
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,760
who have been very much against the tradition of dharma,

235
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,200
they have to be killed.

236
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
Whether you kill them or not, they are already dead

237
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,560
because they have committed so many sins.

238
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,040
They are already dead.

239
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
So you should not think that you are killing,

240
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,880
but it’s a Divine

241
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
which is going to kill them, so-called killing.

242
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,760
And so the war started.

243
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,320
In the Gita also people have very less understanding

244
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,600
as to what he wanted to communicate.

245
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,480
The first thing, I mean the war is on

246
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,400
and he’s talking about philosophy, you can imagine the detachment.

247
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,280
The first thing he told him that, “You should take to Gyana.”

248
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,040
“Gyana” means “bodh”.

249
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,160
Bodh, as you know, is only possible through enlightenment.

250
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,760
So he said, “You should take to Gyana, to bodh,

251
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,680
which is enlightenment.”

252
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
But people don’t understand Gyana.

253
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,280
They think that by reading books, by reading all kinds of,

254
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,240
there are so many criticisms of Gita reading all that,

255
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,480
or understanding about Gita.

256
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,120
There are many in this country

257
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
who are giving lectures on Shri Krishna;

258
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,880
in their own lives they are horrible.

259
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,280
So, the first thing he told,,

260
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,680
the best thing to be done that is the only thing to be done.

261
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,120
He was a, not a businessman.

262
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,920
A businessman will tell you first something that is not so good,

263
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,720
then better, better, better raising you slowly.

264
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,560
But he said, outright,

265
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,320
that that is the point by which you become Stitapragya,

266
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,240
means Sahaja yogi. He said clearly.

267
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,800
But Arjuna said then, “If it is so,

268
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,520
why do you want me to go on war, to do this karma?”

269
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,000
That is also very much misunderstood.

270
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,320
Only after Realization you can understand

271
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,680
what he meant by doing karma.

272
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,240
He has said it very clear that,

273
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,920
“You do your work, karmas, your whatever you have to do,

274
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,240
your action, and put it at My lotus feet,”

275
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,840
which is an impossible situation.

276
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,160
As long as you have

277
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,440
the sense that you are doing something - Aham-bhava -

278
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,000
that due to ego, you might call it,

279
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,840
as long as you have this feeling within you,

280
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,000
or maybe

281
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,120
when there is still that “I” is existing within you,

282
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,680
you may say that, “I’m putting it at the lotus feet of God,”

283
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,320
but you don’t.

284
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,680
Because Shri Krishna knew,

285
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
after Arjuna asked the question,

286
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,360
that human nature is not straightforward.

287
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,160
They won’t understand in a straightforward way.

288
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
So he was diplomatically. He told him,

289
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,160
“All right, put everything at my feet, which you cannot do.”

290
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,640
So people tried that.

291
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,960
Ages they have tried and they found out it doesn’t work out that way

292
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,160
"Whatever we do, we feel responsible for it.

293
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,400
So why should we think

294
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,000
that we are putting at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna?

295
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,240
For example, some people who were murderers they would say,

296
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
“All right, we have murdered all right,

297
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,520
but we have put it at the lotus feet of God.”

298
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,840
This kind of a delusion happened.

299
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,440
I mean, there were horrible people in this country

300
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,400
who used to kill

301
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,880
travelers in the name of Goddess.

302
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,080
All these misunderstandings,

303
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,400
which shooted them, they started doing it.

304
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,680
So, he said that,

305
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,080
“Your karma should be at My lotus feet.”

306
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,840
It’s only possible after your Realization,

307
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
when you really feel you are not doing anything.

308
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
You ask Sahaja yogi to give Realization to somebody.

309
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,040
He tells Me, "It’s not going. It’s not working.”

310
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,560
He talks like a third person. He becomes a third person.

311
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,440
He never thinks that he’s doing it.

312
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,200
He is raising the Kundalini himself with his own hand.

313
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,800
He doesn’t say, “I am doing it.”

314
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,760
Or he’ll just say, “Doesn’t work out, Mother, doesn’t work out.”

315
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,960
What’s the matter? He would just say,

316
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,440
“This chakra is there. This problem is there,”

317
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
but he would never say that, “I am doing it.”

318
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,040
So, this karma, this action,

319
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,280
becomes akarma, means “non-action”.

320
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,280
Though you are acting, doing everything,

321
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,760
still you don’t feel you are doing anything.

322
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
That’s why he said,

323
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,880
“Normally people would not take to Self-realization.

324
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
So better to give them this condition,

325
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,040
that whatever you do you put at the lotus feet of God.”

326
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Then, he asked about Bhakti.

327
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,720
So, for Bhakti he said, “All right, very clever, you know.

328
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,600
I am not that clever as he was.

329
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,040
I am telling you everything straightforward.”

330
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,600
Because he knew human beings are too clever,

331
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,680
and if they are to be convinced, they cannot be convinced

332
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
just by telling them straightforward things.

333
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,600
And so he says, “All right,

334
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,680
whatever flower, water,

335
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,600
fruit, you give it to me, I’ll accept.”

336
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,720
That’s the Bhakti part. But,

337
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,000
this is now the trick.

338
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
The Bhakti

339
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,160
is to be done when there is not the other, Ananya.

340
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,840
Ananya means there’s nobody else, you and Me.

341
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,400
That means you should be connected to Me.

342
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,760
Then only you can do Bhakti.

343
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,440
But nobody understand, nobody understand the meaning of word,

344
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,800
“Ananya”, or they don’t want to understand.

345
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,280
Ananya means where there is not the other,

346
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,520
means you are a Self-realized soul.

347
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,920
That’s the Bhakti I will accept.

348
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
When I get these Hari Rama people suffering from

349
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
all kinds of troubles and they say,

350
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,000
“Mother, how is it we are suffering from Shri Krishna’s troubles?”

351
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,440
So I tell them, “You have no connection with Shri Krishna.

352
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,400
You are not connected. Supposing this is not connected,

353
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,560
this won’t work.

354
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,160
And there’s a protocol. Shri Krishna is an incarnation.

355
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,040
Even if you have to meet the Chief Minister here

356
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,360
and you go on calling his name, you’ll be arrested.

357
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,440
But he’s Almighty.

358
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,400
How can you take his name so cheaply,

359
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,880
as if he belongs to you or he is in your pocket?”

360
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,120
So, there’s a protocol.

361
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,960
But they were told

362
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,440
that, “You must take the name of Shri Krishna

363
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,680
or of Shri Ram or the name of God.

364
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,600
Just pray to God that you should not forget God.”

365
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,360
That’s the reason. But this not the way.

366
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,520
Like mad, people are going on with it.

367
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,200
That’s how the Kundalini gets spoiled.

368
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,320
I have seen they have Vishuddhi problems

369
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,200
and they never feel in their hands anything.

370
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,240
They’ll go on telling you, “Mother, we don’t feel this or that.”

371
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,480
They are Shri Krishna Bhaktas. So, their Bhakti is also wrong.

372
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,440
But Shri Krishna, whatever is told  you have to understand it,

373
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
written in small lines, what he is trying to say.

374
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,720
His mischiefs, his childlike

375
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,320
pranks he used to play,

376
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,880
all were so sweet and beautiful.

377
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,160
To create a feeling from the innocence, respect.

378
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
I mean, an Indian if he sees a child

379
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,200
he develops a kind of a feeling which is called vatsalya,

380
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,560
the feeling of great love and affection

381
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,120
and protection for children.

382
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,600
But in the West I am surprised the way they are under attack.

383
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,680
Children are so much under attack.

384
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,120
I don’t know why are they doing it.

385
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,200
There’s no feeling of vatsalya at all.

386
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,120
It’s something so cruel.

387
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I don’t know if they are possessed,

388
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,120
or there’s kind of a influence of their previous lives,

389
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
or whatever it is. It’s very common with them.

390
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,320
The way they attack innocence - small children.

391
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,600
Impossible to understand how can human beings do that.

392
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,520
So, Shri Krishna’s childlike behavior - so beautiful

393
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,960
that that makes you feel that love

394
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,600
and affection, protection, for the little child.

395
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,400
I have to tell about Shri Krishnas sister - I was going to tell,

396
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,400
but She thougt, I might forget.

397
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Shri Krishna had a sister, as you know - Vishnumaya -

398
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,560
and she’s the electricity.

399
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,800
We have seen in Cabella, in Canada,

400
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,840
the miracles of Vishnumaya.

401
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,040
When I went to Canada,

402
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
it was said by the aboriginal people

403
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,720
that when the Holy Mother will come,

404
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,120
the whole sky will become red with lightning.

405
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,600
And, the lightning started, next day.

406
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,240
Even before it was daytime, I saw the sky red like this,

407
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,720
completely red. So many people saw it.

408
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,320
But, there were sixteen thousand lightnings,

409
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,080
sixteen thousand lightnings. It was in the newspaper up there.

410
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,160
It was going on, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, the whole night.

411
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,640
And I said “Now I’ll go and sit in the bathroom so it will stop.”

412
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,600
And then it stopped. Otherwise it was going on like that.

413
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,960
How he was connected with the Pandavas.

414
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,640
Draupadi was also his sister.

415
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,560
So Vishnumaya was born as Draupadi.

416
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,520
Also, his mother was there, Yeshoda.

417
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,920
And when Radhaji was the Mahalakshmi,

418
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Mother Mary, and she gave birth to

419
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,520
Shri Ganesha. That was Lord Jesus Christ.

420
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,560
In India, nobody would doubt the,

421
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,000
the Immaculate Conception. Nobody would doubt.

422
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,120
But, for others it is too much

423
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,160
to believe in the Immaculate Conception.

424
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,560
Or they are all arguing and saying all kinds of nonsensical things.

425
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,240
Because Ganesha was created like that,

426
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,760
and also Christ could be created like that.

427
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,520
[Hindi: Iski koi zaroorat nahi hai – hai kya? ]

428
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,320
So Radha, she was Mother Mary.

429
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,640
And it is surprising if you read the Devi Mahatmya

430
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440
in that it’s clearly written who was Christ,

431
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,640
that He was the support.

432
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,800
He was called as Mahavishnu. He was the support.

433
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,640
That’s the Mooladhara. He was the support of the universe.

434
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,160
All these were all related people,

435
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,840
but we are stupidly fighting

436
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,520
because we do not have the knowledge of reality.

437
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,320
So, Radhaji wanted to give him the name Yeshoda.

438
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,320
So he called him Yesu. In Hebrew it is Yesu.

439
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,960
Also in India Yeshoda is called as Jasodha.

440
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,200
Many people called him Jeshua.

441
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,160
That’s how he became Jesus.

442
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,800
You can verify what I am saying on your vibrations.

443
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,360
So, they are all related to each other,

444
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,160
and greatest thing is

445
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,000
they are divine people.

446
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,440
We cannot understand that, we cannot analyze that,

447
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,040
we cannot pass remarks about Him.

448
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,680
It is a sign of human arrogance,

449
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,440
because his knowledge is so limited,

450
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,400
and with that limited knowledge he want to

451
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,240
talk about divinity which is beyond

452
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
the brains, beyond human intelligence.

453
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,960
So only thing we can do is to be humble and to be surrendered.

454
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,400
That’s how Islam came, which means surrender.

455
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,080
Where are they surrendering, God knows?

456
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,720
Or Christians, where are they following Christ?

457
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,440
Hindus, where are they following the principle

458
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,040
that everybody has the spirit in their heart?

459
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,080
How can you have caste system if everybody has the spirit?

460
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,320
Now, thank God, so many people in the whole world

461
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,400
have become Sahaja Yogis. We are transcended

462
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,840
all these artificial barriers in our divine life.

463
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,320
How can Divine divide people?

464
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
Some higher, some lower, cannot be.

465
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,720
Only thing is, you have to achieve that state

466
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,840
in which you see the whole world as a drama,

467
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,520
as Shri Krishna has said

468
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,520
and you are the witness, the sakshi of all that.

469
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,320
I had to tell all the story about Shri Krishna because

470
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,200
this River Yamuna reminds Me of all those beautiful things He did.

471
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,040
And also I was happy yesterday, they way you’re dancing,

472
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,200
the way you’re enjoying, which is very, very significant.

473
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,280
And the one’s who did this before,

474
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,880
were not saints. They were ordinary people

475
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,760
whom Shri Krishna wanted to hold hand.

476
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,080
They’re called raas. „Ra“ means energy. „Sa“ means with.

477
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,960
They all were holding hands,

478
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,120
so with the energy of Radhaji

479
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,200
everybody was getting enlightened.

480
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,760
All these things, as in all religions,

481
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,800
have lost their own meaning, have lost their own form

482
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,440
and they have become very corrupt.

483
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,160
This is because it’s a mental attitude.

484
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,600
If you have a mental attitude, it has its own limitations

485
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
and after some time, there’s always a decline

486
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:14,320
of all these mental

487
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,520
adventures that you take

488
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,760
because there’s no strength of truth in it.

489
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,320
That’s how you find decline in arts,

490
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,160
in music, in everything, there’s a decline coming.

491
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,400
But now you people have found the Truth,

492
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,440
so please try and understand that

493
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,680
the Truth is the one which is eternal

494
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,280
and the Truth is Love.

495
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,320
Truth is Divine Love

496
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,440
and this Divine Love has no consequences.

497
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
It doesn’t blame anything, doesn’t want anything,

498
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,520
it just wants to love.

499
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,440
And when you see this All-Pervading Power being kind-

500
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,360
everybody here has had some sort of a miracle

501
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,800
and most of them have told Me so many miracles that

502
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,040
"Mother, this happened, that happened, that happened."

503
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,320
It’s all done by this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

504
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,760
And also to convince you it is doing so many things interesting

505
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,160
of showing

506
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,560
different types of my photographs, this and that,

507
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,560
but the best was this time in Navaratri.

508
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,840
I mean, my photograph I saw a background

509
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
which was rather very different,

510
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,240
like something round was there and there was a curtain

511
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,520
and somebody peeking through that, like the sun peeping out.

512
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,120
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised

513
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,880
the whole scene was behind Me there.

514
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,840
So it was before it was even made or conceived.

515
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,720
It was seen there in Navaratri Puja.

516
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,800
That means all these things also that you are conceiving

517
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,240
are suggested by the Divine.

518
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,080
Otherwise, how can it be possible that

519
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,520
one month before we got that kind of a photograph,

520
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,640
which I was wondering, how can that be behind Me?

521
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,760
And that was there when we went to Moscow everybody saw this.

522
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,720
It’s very surprising. So all kinds of tricks He’s playing.

523
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,680
Even when I’m not there, He shows that I’m there

524
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,520
and it’s working out in so many ways

525
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,560
that one has to understand that what we think is miracle

526
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,840
is a play of this All-Pervading Power.

527
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,200
I hope you have enjoyed your stay here

528
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,960
and we have still a big tour to go on.

529
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,680
I hope more people are coming now, so

530
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,200
you are all comfortable here.

531
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,480
After realization, actually I have seen

532
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,440
people don’t care for physical comforts.

533
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,200
They just care for the comforts of the spirit.

534
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,960
People are very deep and you have met the people of India.

535
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,120
They’re also very deep people, very good humble people.

536
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,400
We are all part and parcel of One Body

537
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,760
and that’s what one has to remember.

538
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
I hope you’re all right, all of you and tomorrow,

539
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
you don’t know, it’s a very, very cold place they say. Let’s see.

540
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,120
As the sun has come here, maybe the same sun will help us there.

541
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,520
May God bless you.
