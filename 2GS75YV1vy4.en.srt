00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:07,336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

2
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:45,082
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

3
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:49,101
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

4
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,327
I don’t know what to say.

5
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:58,550
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

6
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,488
because most of you come from a culture

7
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:07,418
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

8
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,516
They never realised how important it was that,

9
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:15,865
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

10
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:22,609
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

11
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:32,820
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

12
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:38,484
And also the desire to know the Divine

13
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:50,398
vanishes also in the thin air

14
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:56,953
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

15
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:02,421
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

16
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:11,749
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

17
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:16,820
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

18
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:25,780
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

19
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:32,051
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

20
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:46,398
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

21
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:52,343
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

22
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,862
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

23
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:04,949
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

24
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:07,621
and entertained us the most.

25
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:11,058
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

26
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:16,044
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

27
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,945
and they think that you are laughing at them.

28
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:31,117
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

29
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,667
was more than what one would expect

30
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:42,937
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

31
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:48,961
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

32
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,418
that made us so happy.

33
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:58,055
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

34
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:05,020
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

35
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:10,883
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

36
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:14,965
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

37
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:21,461
His manifestation within you is so evident.

38
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:26,801
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

39
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,793
so very different from other people.

40
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,254
One day I was travelling from London

41
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,640
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

42
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,023
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

43
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:53,925
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

44
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:59,476
I asked her, “Who are you?”

45
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:03,507
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

46
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:09,289
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

47
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,324
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

48
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,824
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

49
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,242
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

50
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:28,597
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

51
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:37,246
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

52
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:42,269
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

53
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:45,422
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

54
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:50,515
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

55
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:53,441
He’s not talked about the source.

56
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,965
I said, “Better find out,

57
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:04,890
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

58
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,750
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

59
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,871
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

60
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:22,652
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

61
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:24,625
and not by the Father.

62
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:27,719
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

63
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:33,140
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

64
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,586
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

65
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:48,355
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

66
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,433
also about the Jews.

67
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:59,867
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

68
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,425
nor about Shri Ganesh.

69
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:11,594
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

70
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:19,414
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

71
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:25,215
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

72
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,851
So now, when we deal with our children,

73
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:38,898
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

74
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:43,339
they are very innocent, very simple;

75
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:49,359
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

76
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,214
and they lose their moorings.

77
00:16:56,074 --> 00:17:03,086
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

78
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:08,152
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

79
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:15,887
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

80
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:21,027
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

81
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:28,281
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

82
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,738
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

83
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,167
But you should know He is on every chakra.

84
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:46,734
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

85
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:49,167
specially the spiritual one.

86
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:54,691
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

87
00:17:56,402 --> 00:18:00,746
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

88
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:08,277
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

89
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:18,035
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

90
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:26,743
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

91
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,597
It was Sahaj.

92
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:35,726
The life before Self-realisation was different.

93
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:38,241
You got your transformation

94
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:48,292
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

95
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,828
But here now we have to see

96
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:57,078
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

97
00:18:57,238 --> 00:19:02,017
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

98
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:10,398
you have to cure people, you have to love them

99
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,164
and you have to be compassionate

100
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:21,125
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

101
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,930
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

102
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:35,537
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

103
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,427
You can project it to others.

104
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:46,739
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

105
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:53,763
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

106
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,921
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

107
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,741
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

108
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:07,272
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

109
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:11,929
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

110
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,030
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

111
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,374
This is what you have to practise,

112
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:23,948
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

113
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,701
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

114
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:33,257
Now, for example, say

115
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,301
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

116
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:47,218
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

117
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:52,921
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

118
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:57,315
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

119
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:06,534
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

120
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:14,655
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

121
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:21,385
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

122
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,386
Not very difficult.

123
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:29,515
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

124
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:35,480
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

125
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,804
The energy will diminish.

126
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:47,917
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

127
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:54,865
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

128
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,349
you are not ordinary people

129
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:02,822
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

130
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:12,568
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

131
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:16,220
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

132
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:21,341
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

133
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:27,397
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

134
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:30,833
or how to deliberately do this.

135
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:34,068
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

136
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,685
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

137
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:50,021
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

138
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:54,228
but just your majestic personality.

139
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:59,087
This personality is here now, you see,

140
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:03,727
is sitting in such a majestic manner

141
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:11,013
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

142
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:20,478
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

143
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,607
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

144
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,970
I don’t think is alright.

145
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:36,544
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

146
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,071
so much ego, so much conditioning.

147
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:47,888
But something within you can rise above others

148
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:58,470
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

149
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:01,138
where you stand with yourself.

150
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:05,075
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

151
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,880
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

152
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:18,087
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

153
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:23,354
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

154
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:30,123
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

155
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,734
But the innocence that you have,

156
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:39,761
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

157
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:46,983
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

158
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:50,951
you are not properly dressed up

159
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:54,487
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

160
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,753
that they expect every other person to be.

161
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,947
It’s a funny thing that in this world

162
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:04,456
all human beings expect others to be very good.

163
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,933
Everybody should be a hero or something

164
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,784
– what about themselves they never think!

165
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:13,136
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

166
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:17,199
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

167
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,816
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

168
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:27,667
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

169
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,870
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

170
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,488
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

171
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:42,753
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

172
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,882
as a child does.

173
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:51,011
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

174
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:55,363
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

175
00:25:55,523 --> 00:26:01,292
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

176
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:05,839
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

177
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:14,444
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

178
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:20,355
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

179
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:24,499
the whole world get worried about it,

180
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:28,597
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

181
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:34,933
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

182
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,081
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

183
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:43,324
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

184
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:49,230
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

185
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,824
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

186
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:58,351
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

187
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:07,128
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

188
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:09,647
but just spontaneously.

189
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:17,730
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

190
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,628
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

191
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,628
You can’t run away from the society.

192
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:32,679
You start getting all the rapport with such people

193
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,426
who are talking about things

194
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,581
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

195
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:45,749
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

196
00:27:47,202 --> 00:27:50,988
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

197
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:56,992
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

198
00:27:58,874 --> 00:28:05,761
In the sense that – when I was in London

199
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:10,355
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

200
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:14,355
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

201
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:16,483
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

202
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:20,238
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

203
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,363
all the married women have to wear this.

204
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:28,847
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

205
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,589
So I said that,

206
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:35,105
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

207
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:38,558
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

208
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:44,968
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

209
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,902
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

210
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:56,167
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

211
00:28:56,327 --> 00:29:00,866
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

212
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:04,675
For the innocence, I think

213
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:09,905
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

214
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,191
And that’s how it is a society, today,

215
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:22,636
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

216
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,652
Every individual is separate,

217
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:29,066
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

218
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:35,433
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

219
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:39,847
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

220
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:43,292
or greed behind the whole thing.

221
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:48,949
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

222
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:54,488
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

223
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:58,003
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

224
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:03,007
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

225
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:08,995
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

226
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:12,480
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

227
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,370
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

228
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,214
“What will they misunderstand?”

229
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:21,441
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

230
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:24,277
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

231
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:28,003
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

232
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:32,542
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

233
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:37,441
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

234
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,003
But then I noticed it’s too much

235
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:44,066
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

236
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:47,214
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

237
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:51,034
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

238
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:54,503
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

239
00:30:54,663 --> 00:31:04,175
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

240
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:11,718
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

241
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:16,870
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

242
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,097
I just can’t understand how they accept.

243
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:24,827
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

244
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,847
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

245
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:33,503
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

246
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:38,261
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

247
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:44,089
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

248
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:49,519
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

249
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,749
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

250
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:59,673
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

251
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,002
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

252
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:05,456
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

253
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:09,902
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

254
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:13,092
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

255
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:17,967
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

256
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,593
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

257
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:27,761
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

258
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:36,014
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

259
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:40,081
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

260
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:46,094
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

261
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:50,058
but every time you see something you find

262
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,722
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

263
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:58,449
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

264
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:05,757
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

265
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:12,035
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

266
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:14,199
I don’t understand.

267
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,441
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

268
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,886
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

269
00:33:22,046 --> 00:33:24,066
“So what? What’s wrong?”

270
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:28,011
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

271
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:31,816
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

272
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:37,245
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

273
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:42,331
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

274
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:48,636
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

275
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:53,597
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

276
00:33:53,757 --> 00:33:59,195
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

277
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,855
you should be very careful,

278
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,791
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

279
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:09,101
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

280
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:19,144
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

281
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:25,531
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

282
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:32,324
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

283
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:39,718
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

284
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:45,870
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

285
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,956
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

286
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:54,480
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

287
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,378
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

288
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:04,534
how He has made their attention so beautiful

289
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:08,870
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

290
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,366
all the innocent things of the world.”

291
00:35:12,702 --> 00:35:17,425
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

292
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:20,785
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

293
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,511
There are many who are struggling

294
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:27,988
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

295
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:32,037
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

296
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,744
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

297
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:39,191
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

298
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:43,929
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

299
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:49,824
That shows that there are so many people still

300
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:55,519
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

301
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,278
and they want to enjoy it.

302
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:00,777
But a society has to be created of that kind.

303
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:06,167
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

304
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:13,538
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

305
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,755
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

306
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:19,822
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

307
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:24,910
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

308
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,851
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

309
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,636
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

310
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:38,355
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

311
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:42,230
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

312
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:48,949
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

313
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:52,769
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

314
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:55,141
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

315
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:58,386
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

316
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,902
And one of them then turned around and said,

317
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:04,503
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

318
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:06,745
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

319
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,574
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

320
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:14,863
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

321
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:18,699
you have to project now, to project towards others.

322
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:22,597
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

323
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:25,589
just with one glance you can put that person right,

324
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:31,089
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

325
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,390
In a way that’s a projection.

326
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:39,277
Around your society, around where you are working,

327
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:44,581
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

328
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:47,910
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

329
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:53,745
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

330
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:57,589
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

331
00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:01,745
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

332
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:05,011
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

333
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:08,956
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

334
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:13,472
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

335
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:17,238
You have those qualities within you

336
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:20,714
because potentially you had them before

337
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:25,113
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

338
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:29,242
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

339
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,636
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

340
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:40,886
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

341
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:45,706
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

342
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,441
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

343
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:53,277
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

344
00:38:53,437 --> 00:38:59,261
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

345
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:03,042
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

346
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:08,238
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

347
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:11,867
It is not a coincidence we should say.

348
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:17,792
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

349
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,378
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

350
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:25,081
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

351
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:28,345
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

352
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:32,085
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

353
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,237
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

354
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:38,699
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

355
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,000
He put them under the seat and did all that.

356
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:48,995
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

357
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:52,928
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

358
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:58,386
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

359
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:01,110
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

360
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,980
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

361
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,995
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

362
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,441
You see, it is the power that you have.

363
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:16,421
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

364
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:23,991
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

365
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:27,929
You see, how children understand love.

366
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:33,842
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

367
00:40:34,002 --> 00:40:39,780
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

368
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:45,019
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

369
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,730
and they were very troublesome to begin with

370
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,677
and the parents were worried about them.

371
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:55,179
They sent them to Dharamsala

372
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,214
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

373
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,886
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

374
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:08,597
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

375
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,574
they came back and the parents asked them,

376
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:14,512
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

377
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,662
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

378
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:20,683
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

379
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:26,726
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

380
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,724
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

381
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:35,589
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

382
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:39,120
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

383
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,488
We are not bothered.”

384
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:43,527
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

385
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:45,949
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

386
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,660
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

387
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,699
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

388
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:56,824
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

389
00:41:56,984 --> 00:42:00,817
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

390
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:06,125
Very much satisfied, dignified.

391
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:11,512
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

392
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:14,433
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

393
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:17,335
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

394
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,118
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

395
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:24,847
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

396
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:28,484
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

397
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:31,394
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

398
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:35,176
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

399
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:43,146
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

400
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,855
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

401
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:49,215
but I have not been with them for a long time,

402
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,725
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

403
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:56,203
but look at the love that they have.

404
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:59,715
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

405
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,793
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

406
00:43:02,953 --> 00:43:05,004
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

407
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:08,246
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

408
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:12,816
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

409
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:19,590
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

410
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,887
and so much they admire, they want it.

411
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:31,972
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

412
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:36,950
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

413
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:41,077
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

414
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:44,566
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

415
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:48,730
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

416
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,579
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

417
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,551
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

418
00:43:53,711 --> 00:43:59,422
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

419
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:03,808
and we enjoyed all that very much.

420
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:10,484
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

421
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:17,449
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

422
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:22,461
creating something sweet of this kind.

423
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:27,566
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

424
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:34,738
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

425
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:39,676
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

426
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:43,261
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

427
00:44:43,421 --> 00:44:46,465
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

428
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:49,183
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

429
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:53,472
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

430
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:58,496
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

431
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:03,051
so they got equipped from within.

432
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:07,777
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

433
00:45:07,937 --> 00:45:11,660
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

434
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:19,144
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

435
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:22,074
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

436
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:25,324
also know that we have to give it to others.

437
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:29,847
We have to pour this into others.

438
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:33,332
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

439
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:37,285
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

440
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:42,613
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

441
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:47,558
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

442
00:45:47,718 --> 00:45:51,824
And Shiva had to cut His head

443
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:56,472
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

444
00:45:56,632 --> 00:46:02,494
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

445
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:06,676
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

446
00:46:06,836 --> 00:46:11,285
because in innocence you become a person

447
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:14,855
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

448
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:19,153
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

449
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:24,922
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

450
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:31,535
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

451
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,105
There was a king in China.

452
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:36,926
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

453
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:47,426
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

454
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:51,859
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

455
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:55,816
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

456
00:46:55,976 --> 00:47:00,949
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

457
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,051
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

458
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:09,090
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

459
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,842
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

460
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:16,678
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

461
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,678
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

462
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,412
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

463
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:32,517
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

464
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:35,955
So all the cocks were together.

465
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:40,701
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

466
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:44,084
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

467
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:47,314
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

468
00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:49,576
he was just standing straight.

469
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:54,240
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

470
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,561
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

471
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:03,889
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

472
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,568
where they were having these fights.

473
00:48:07,728 --> 00:48:12,041
And this was the only cock which stood up.

474
00:48:12,213 --> 00:48:17,904
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

475
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:22,576
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

476
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:26,942
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

477
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:30,327
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

478
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:34,787
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

479
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:39,529
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

480
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:45,291
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

481
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:54,885
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

482
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:58,108
if you take to your innocence.

483
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:03,432
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

484
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:08,975
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

485
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,939
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

486
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:15,338
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

487
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:18,197
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

488
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:20,471
It rained so much so that they said,

489
00:49:20,631 --> 00:49:25,525
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

490
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:27,922
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

491
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:33,556
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

492
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:39,756
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

493
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:47,283
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

494
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:52,576
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

495
00:49:52,818 --> 00:49:56,588
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

496
00:49:56,748 --> 00:50:02,111
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

497
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:08,194
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

498
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:13,438
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

499
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:18,486
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

500
00:50:18,646 --> 00:50:32,241
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

501
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,735
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

502
00:50:34,895 --> 00:50:39,892
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

503
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:46,635
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

504
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,906
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

505
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:56,648
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

506
00:50:56,808 --> 00:51:00,445
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

507
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:05,437
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

508
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:09,921
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

509
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:15,195
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

510
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:18,484
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

511
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:23,093
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

512
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:30,800
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

513
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:34,552
How He guides you and how He helps you.

514
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:36,957
How He takes you to [the] right path.

515
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:39,566
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

516
00:51:39,726 --> 00:51:44,941
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

517
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:49,535
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

518
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:54,660
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

519
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,027
He takes you to the righteous road.

520
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:03,222
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

521
00:52:03,382 --> 00:52:05,933
You always meet friends here and there.

522
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:08,347
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

523
00:52:08,507 --> 00:52:10,949
And that is how He works.

524
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:20,683
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

525
00:52:20,843 --> 00:52:23,324
because you are His ganas.

526
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:26,367
But the ganas have to work!

527
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:33,108
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

528
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:41,753
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

529
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:47,863
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

530
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:50,933
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

531
00:52:51,093 --> 00:52:54,394
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

532
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:57,468
He gives you all the good time.

533
00:52:58,413 --> 00:53:00,832
Then what are we doing about it?

534
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:06,160
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

535
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,922
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

536
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:14,347
What can we do as antibodies?

537
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:26,259
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

538
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:33,282
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

539
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:39,904
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

540
00:53:40,064 --> 00:53:42,490
You may melt away many people.

541
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:49,662
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

542
00:53:49,822 --> 00:53:54,474
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

543
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:58,230
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

544
00:53:58,391 --> 00:54:03,089
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

545
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,948
Because you are so powerful.

546
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,200
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

547
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:14,638
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

548
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:18,068
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

549
00:54:18,228 --> 00:54:22,232
And all that works out so well.

550
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,912
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

551
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:31,928
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

552
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:35,111
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:40,256
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

554
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:43,416
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

555
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:48,217
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

556
00:54:48,377 --> 00:54:52,041
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

557
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:56,670
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

558
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,209
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

559
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:03,006
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

560
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,881
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

561
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:13,245
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

562
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:17,553
But you are not to feel any strain.

563
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:21,959
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

564
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,889
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

565
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:27,334
– confidence and faith in yourself.

566
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:32,451
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

567
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:36,345
which is nothing but compassion and love.

568
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:39,428
If you have that faith

569
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:44,924
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

570
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:54,502
of having [a] relationship with others.

571
00:55:56,166 --> 00:56:03,650
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

572
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,181
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

573
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:13,045
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

574
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:16,428
I have never got into a fury or a temper

575
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:18,771
because I think I can manage without it.

576
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:22,795
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

577
00:56:22,955 --> 00:56:27,873
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

578
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:32,459
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

579
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:35,381
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

580
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,724
it is such an energy-giving thing,

581
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:48,384
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

582
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:52,412
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

583
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:58,662
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

584
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:03,443
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

585
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:07,529
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

586
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:09,556
that you can’t leave.

587
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:15,803
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

588
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:17,986
they don’t know how the child is lost.

589
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:24,421
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

590
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:29,857
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

591
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,709
But when they are young, they are innocent

592
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:37,357
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

593
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:42,896
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

594
00:57:43,056 --> 00:57:47,076
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

595
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:53,716
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

596
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:58,294
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

597
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:02,123
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

598
00:58:02,283 --> 00:58:08,248
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

599
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:11,443
that your children are looked after.

600
00:58:11,603 --> 00:58:14,818
But you are also a child of your Mother.

601
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:19,334
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

602
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:25,724
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

603
00:58:25,884 --> 00:58:29,326
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

604
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:34,287
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

605
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:36,310
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

606
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,826
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

607
00:58:39,986 --> 00:58:41,841
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

608
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:45,485
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

609
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:54,048
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

610
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,959
Today is to celebrate His birth

611
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,545
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

612
00:59:04,705 --> 00:59:10,572
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

613
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:16,006
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

614
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:22,635
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

615
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:26,549
And that’s why He was first created.

616
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:32,412
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

617
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:35,963
so that He can look after all the people

618
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:44,002
who are going to come from ages to ages,

619
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:48,987
to guide them always on the right path.

620
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:53,928
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

621
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:58,256
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

622
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:00,967
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

623
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:03,076
That I should have not done.”

624
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:08,568
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

625
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:11,912
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

626
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:15,404
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

627
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:19,334
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

628
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:23,193
“Why did you give up your land?”

629
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:27,404
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

630
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:31,886
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

631
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:36,069
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

632
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:38,146
So I thought it’s better to give up.

633
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:40,717
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

634
01:00:40,877 --> 01:00:45,072
And he so innocently was telling me that,

635
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:51,279
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

636
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,381
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

637
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:58,779
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

638
01:00:58,939 --> 01:01:00,785
But I said, “What about your brother?”

639
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:04,431
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

640
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:07,521
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

641
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:11,904
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

642
01:01:12,064 --> 01:01:15,060
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

643
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,889
Later on I might become a bad man.”

644
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:21,700
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

645
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,412
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

646
01:01:24,572 --> 01:01:29,130
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

647
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:33,639
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

648
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:35,217
I don’t know what to do.

649
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:38,553
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

650
01:01:38,713 --> 01:01:44,526
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

651
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,990
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

652
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:52,154
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

653
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:56,459
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

654
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:02,474
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

655
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:06,170
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

656
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:10,537
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

657
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:13,381
So he can save me from the smoking.”

658
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:17,904
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

659
01:02:18,064 --> 01:02:20,779
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

660
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:24,334
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

661
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:28,990
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

662
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:33,615
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

663
01:02:33,775 --> 01:02:38,232
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

664
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:42,489
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

665
01:02:42,649 --> 01:02:47,877
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

666
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:53,420
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

667
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:58,209
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

668
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:03,842
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

669
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:09,560
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

670
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,381
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

671
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:16,529
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

672
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:21,045
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

673
01:03:21,205 --> 01:03:25,506
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

674
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,490
For example, I have never seen such honest people

675
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:32,310
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

676
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:36,092
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

677
01:03:36,252 --> 01:03:39,123
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

678
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:42,045
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

679
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:45,795
but most of you have become so honest.

680
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,654
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

681
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:52,666
and to see people who are so honest.

682
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:56,612
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

683
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:01,490
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

684
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:07,447
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

685
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:13,271
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

686
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:17,837
how you people are so much fond of me.

687
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:29,420
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

688
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:32,623
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

689
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:36,154
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

690
01:04:36,314 --> 01:04:38,310
Because He’s so attached to me

691
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:42,217
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

692
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:44,139
That’s what you are.

693
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:46,482
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

694
01:04:46,642 --> 01:04:50,498
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

695
01:04:50,658 --> 01:04:55,349
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

696
01:04:55,509 --> 01:05:02,115
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

697
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:05,224
But the another quality, as I said, is that

698
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:10,146
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

699
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:15,873
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

700
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:22,670
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

701
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:30,224
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

702
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,699
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

703
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:37,389
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

704
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:42,803
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

705
01:05:42,963 --> 01:05:47,998
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

706
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:50,404
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

707
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:54,295
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

708
01:05:54,455 --> 01:06:00,193
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

709
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:04,240
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

710
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,521
Nobody makes a mistake.”

711
01:06:06,681 --> 01:06:10,084
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

712
01:06:10,244 --> 01:06:14,576
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

713
01:06:14,736 --> 01:06:18,736
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

714
01:06:18,897 --> 01:06:23,014
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

715
01:06:23,174 --> 01:06:28,170
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

716
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:32,209
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

717
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:36,795
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

718
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:44,498
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

719
01:06:44,658 --> 01:06:55,986
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

720
01:06:56,752 --> 01:07:01,224
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

721
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:06,084
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

722
01:07:06,244 --> 01:07:09,795
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

723
01:07:09,955 --> 01:07:12,380
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

724
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,849
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

725
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:22,756
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

726
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:28,662
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

727
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:36,303
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

728
01:07:36,463 --> 01:07:41,209
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

729
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:48,943
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

730
01:07:49,103 --> 01:07:55,654
with such speed and with such lightness:

731
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,240
they were lifting their legs and hand.

732
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,775
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

733
01:08:04,884 --> 01:08:09,982
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

734
01:08:10,142 --> 01:08:14,060
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

735
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,974
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

736
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:20,849
They earn their living, they are farmers,

737
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:25,959
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

738
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,912
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

739
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:38,271
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

740
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:41,553
or another bad things that people think

741
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:45,157
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

742
01:08:45,317 --> 01:08:48,403
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

743
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:54,146
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

744
01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:56,287
in a very beautiful manner.

745
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,334
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

746
01:09:02,494 --> 01:09:05,678
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

747
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:11,678
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

748
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:17,982
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

749
01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:23,334
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

750
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:26,068
and think of violence and killing people?

751
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,865
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

752
01:09:29,025 --> 01:09:32,873
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

753
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:37,889
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

754
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:44,381
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

755
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:48,615
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

756
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:54,529
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

757
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:56,810
There is no need for us to fight.

758
01:09:56,970 --> 01:10:01,365
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

759
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:05,146
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

760
01:10:05,306 --> 01:10:08,326
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

761
01:10:08,486 --> 01:10:11,037
He’ll either become a transformed person

762
01:10:11,197 --> 01:10:15,213
or he will not be there to trouble you.

763
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:21,170
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

764
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,572
and our powers.

765
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:29,373
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

766
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:34,556
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

767
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:39,451
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

768
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:43,111
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

769
01:10:43,384 --> 01:10:44,899
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

770
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,262
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

771
01:10:48,423 --> 01:10:50,482
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

772
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:53,490
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

773
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:58,881
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

774
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:04,810
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

775
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,318
You can do it, everything. You can.

776
01:11:07,478 --> 01:11:11,709
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

777
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:16,553
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

778
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:18,904
you are not going to spoil anybody,

779
01:11:19,064 --> 01:11:23,935
but your power itself will show that this power

780
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:32,490
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

781
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:35,685
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

782
01:11:35,845 --> 01:11:41,611
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

783
01:11:41,813 --> 01:11:47,201
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

784
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:54,861
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

785
01:11:55,642 --> 01:12:01,318
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

786
01:12:01,478 --> 01:12:05,349
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

787
01:12:05,509 --> 01:12:08,584
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

788
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:12,639
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

789
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,412
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

790
01:12:16,572 --> 01:12:19,474
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

791
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:22,180
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

792
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:25,513
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

793
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,764
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

794
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:32,490
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

795
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,693
and they are sitting there and fighting,

796
01:12:34,853 --> 01:12:38,529
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

797
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:42,833
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

798
01:12:42,993 --> 01:12:46,006
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

799
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,740
So there were four tiers.

800
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,740
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

801
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,099
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

802
01:12:54,259 --> 01:12:59,204
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

803
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:03,709
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

804
01:13:03,869 --> 01:13:11,697
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

805
01:13:12,563 --> 01:13:18,467
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

806
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:23,900
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

807
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,178
He’s the one who worked it out.

808
01:13:27,338 --> 01:13:28,740
That’s why they say always,

809
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,654
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

810
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:35,615
because then it gives you that peace,

811
01:13:35,775 --> 01:13:41,326
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

812
01:13:41,486 --> 01:13:44,619
that you never thought it would.

813
01:13:47,634 --> 01:13:52,232
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

814
01:13:52,392 --> 01:13:57,154
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

815
01:13:57,314 --> 01:14:00,318
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

816
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:02,693
We are still hoping to get the land

817
01:14:02,853 --> 01:14:06,100
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

818
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,834
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

819
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:13,115
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

820
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:17,216
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

821
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:23,361
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

822
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:27,935
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

823
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:31,295
But all that has worked out so well and now

824
01:14:31,455 --> 01:14:35,170
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

825
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,409
May God Bless you.
