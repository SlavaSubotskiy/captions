1
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:07,812
It’s such a pleasure to come to this great country

2
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:11,462
where there are so many seekers.

3
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:16,555
So many seekers are born in these modern times.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,760
There were never born so many, any time before.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,421
For example at the time of Christ,

6
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:33,792
He had to gather crowds of people but they had no seeking;

7
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:41,364
they just listened to Him because they felt it was something new.

8
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:49,349
Today, the time has come where many seekers have taken their birth

9
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:54,525
all over the world and they are seeking.

10
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:04,696
This is a fact one has to accept, there’s no hypocrisy about it.

11
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:10,751
Some people don’t understand that the seeking is there

12
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:14,246
and that whatever they’re doing, right or wrong,

13
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:19,443
actually they are seeking within themselves.

14
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:25,864
Today, in the beginning, I will give you a broadline

15
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:30,982
of Sahaja Yoga,

16
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:36,641
the one that means: A spontaneous happening within us,

17
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:41,095
of union with God. It’s easy to talk about it,

18
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:45,626
any one can talk about it. First, when I went to America,

19
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:49,513
people said, you must get a patent on your lectures, Mother.

20
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,986
I just smiled at them. I said, what’s the matter?

21
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:59,142
They said, they might use your words
and use the same things for their own purpose

22
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:04,958
and may be that they all do a lot of harm to you, I said, no,

23
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,044
it’s nice, let them talk about

24
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:13,337
because that’s what has to happen, people have to know about it,

25
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,533
what is there to take a patent for it. We don’t take patent

26
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:23,806
for the light of the sun, and the beauty of the stars.

27
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:26,388
That’s meant for everyone.

28
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:31,833
The main thing is that these lecturing

29
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:41,068
and all such ventures are of no use at all unless and until

30
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:47,982
the happening takes place. It should happen to you.

31
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:54,603
It’s an actualization, it is the Becoming which is important.

32
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:58,099
It’s not reading about it;

33
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:04,481
It's a living force within us
which has made us a human being from ameba

34
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:12,391
and it’s a living force which is
going to make us a higher personality:

35
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:20,669
A prophet. As William Blake has very clearly said,

36
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:25,102
that men of God will become prophets

37
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:30,626
and the day will come when
these prophets will have special capacity

38
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,309
to transform other people as prophets;

39
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:42,364
that time has come today.
William Blake could see hundred years back

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,086
the working of Sahaja Yoga and today you can see the actualization.

41
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,352
Before you today they have placed the diagram of our being.

42
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:11,367
It’s a very complicated stuff;

43
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:18,125
they are trying to make it a simple
diagram for you though it looks still complicated.

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,446
For example when you are sitting in this room

45
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:25,797
supposing there was no light,

46
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:31,975
one has to just tell you that,
just push the button and all the lights will be on.

47
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:37,102
But behind this happening

48
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:40,555
there is a big mistery about electricity,

49
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:45,629
and a big mechanism and a great organization that does it.

50
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:48,503
It’s not just the pushing of a button.

51
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:55,176
Now my situation is such that I can push the button, alright

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,187
but people want to know the history and all the headache about it;

53
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,731
so I have to explain to you what is it about.

54
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,721
Here you see the subtle force, the subtle being within us.

55
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:26,100
This is a human being which has evolved to this stage of awareness

56
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:30,900
and that he has to become that dynamic awareness.

57
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:39,251
If you try to make any instrument,
say for example you try to make this microphone;

58
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,734
people would definitely ask, what is the purpose ?

59
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:49,123
Until it is connected to the mains it has no purpose at all.

60
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,998
In the same way you are created to be beautiful human beings

61
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,830
and you are to be connected to the mains,

62
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:01,151
otherwise you do not find your absolute value.

63
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:05,580
Now the Kundalini about which many people have talked.

64
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:08,939
I mean they have written books after books, and I was shocked

65
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:14,496
for they do not know anything about it,
and how could they write such big books;

66
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,458
from where did they get the knowledge?

67
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:23,060
This Kundalini is a very simple thing.

68
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:31,752
It is the pure desire within us,

69
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:43,400
that one has to become one with the Spirit, is the pure desire.

70
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:48,162
So that through the Spirit, we know God.

71
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:57,400
This pure desire, this power of
pure desire exists within us as Kundalini.

72
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:04,607
The whole being manifested, but still it is sleeping.

73
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,177
It’s completely there, after

74
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,773
creating the whole being as a human being -still it is sleeping,

75
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:17,439
because that power of desire,

76
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:22,537
has not got the chance to manifest itself.

77
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:30,541
Now for this desire of power, people think that you can excite it

78
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:37,299
or something. Some people have started enterprises

79
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:42,494
of Kundalini Yoga, of Kundalini awakening;

80
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:46,693
it is not a commercial stuff, it is not !

81
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,853
It’s a living process.

82
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:56,260
You cannot commercialize it. You cannot pay for it.

83
00:07:56,787 --> 00:08:00,986
We have got brains, we are human beings,

84
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:06,533
we must understand that we cannot pay for the Divine Love.

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,529
On the contrary, you insult it, if you talk of money.

86
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:15,180
God does not understand money, it’s your myth,

87
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,185
human beings have created it; He does not know what money is.

88
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:30,900
You cannot pay for it! You cannot put in any effort for it.

89
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:44,529
For becoming a fruit, a flower
does not put in any effort or pay any money.

90
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:49,724
How much money did you pay to become a human being from a monkey?

91
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:54,431
What effort did you put in to do that ?

92
00:08:54,588 --> 00:09:02,068
It is spontaneous. Like a seed which sprouts through its primule

93
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:06,092
and the same primule becomes the root and the shoot

94
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:16,556
and a little cell at the tip of the root
works out all the digging by itself, spontaneously.

95
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,786
Only living things can be spontaneous

96
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,841
And then the shoot rises by itself, becomes the leaves

97
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:33,251
and becomes the flowers and then the fruit:

98
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:40,481
The whole map of its being is microscopically placed in that seed.

99
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:50,832
In the same way within us is placed the primule,
the germinating force, called as Kundalini.

100
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,793
And this force which exists within us

101
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,781
in three and a half coils (there’s a big mathematics about it,

102
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:05,796
which I think I cannot discuss it today,
but sometime we’ll discuss it).

103
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:13,609
Now it is very important to see the position of Kundalini:

104
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:16,349
It is placed in the triangular bone,

105
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,910
this bone is called sacrum;

106
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:24,559
the sacrum word comes from the Greek language.

107
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:29,520
Greeks must have known this that this is the sacred bone,

108
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,876
so they called it sacrum, it’s most surprising.

109
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,816
When they came to Australia, some Greeks,

110
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:39,279
they must have felt the vibrations of your river,

111
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,512
so they called it Parramatta.

112
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,207
Have you ever thought of what does that mean?

113
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:50,680
It means the Holy Ghost.
‘Para’ is beyond, supreme, ‘Mata’ is the Mother.

114
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:57,848
Some realized soul must have felt the vibrations of this river

115
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:01,832
and they must have named it. In the same way they must have felt

116
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,641
that this bone is something special,

117
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:11,520
and this is the last bone that gets burnt up,
when the body is completely

118
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:15,290
burnt under electrical pressure.

119
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,024
Now this force resides in this bone,

120
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:26,066
and you can see with your own eyes; today in the University

121
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:33,097
many students saw it: the pulsation of the Kundalini in the bone.

122
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:37,374
Now can you do that, any one of you, by jumping

123
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,254
or by shouting or by screaming or by chanting or by paying.

124
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:47,473
Whatever you can do cannot be Divine.

125
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:53,410
Divine has to be something that is beyond human endeavor.

126
00:11:55,012 --> 00:12:00,461
You can jump, you can shout, you can do this, you can do that,

127
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:07,371
but you cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

128
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:15,945
And this miracle you see every day, billions and billions of these,

129
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,976
we take it for granted.

130
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:22,488
We have taken our human awareness also for granted,
it’s a good thing,

131
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:26,406
otherwise we start thinking about it, we go into another

132
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:30,797
tension mounting upon our heads.

133
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:36,422
Now this force lies above the first centre.

134
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:42,804
The first centre is the center called as Mooladhara Chakra.

135
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:48,468
Now this is a very big confusion,

136
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,311
one of the biggest in the modern times.

137
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:57,238
As it is, modern times are known to be full of confusions only.

138
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:01,183
Only in confusions we have to find the truth,

139
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:05,982
unless and until there is confusion, there cannot be that seeking.

140
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:08,664
And this confusion has reached such a stage,

141
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:12,271
that we are confused even about Kundalini.

142
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:16,542
And there are people who have worked hard to confuse us also.

143
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:23,127
This important point,

144
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,570
that the first centre within us which is the centre of innocence

145
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,830
is placed below the Kundalini,
is extremely important to understand.

146
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:39,920
And that ... Kundalini resides in the
triangular bone which is Mooladhara.

147
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:46,189
So the centre of this power lies below the Kundalini.

148
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:52,088
This is a very important point which I am going to tell you today.

149
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:58,130
The last centre within us, the seventh centre within us,

150
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,001
manifests the pelvic plexus,

151
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,551
I don't know if you are doktors here,

152
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,889
but I tell you the pelvic plexus

153
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:10,993
that the exclusion within our body.

154
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,430
All that is excluded

155
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,835
is manifested through this the subtle centre within us,

156
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,109
which is below the sacrum bone, is a subtle centre.

157
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,256
It looks after the prostrate gland.

158
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:31,889
Now this is the centre of innocence,

159
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:36,018
innocence is the first thing God has created on this earth;

160
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:42,045
is holiness, is beauty of God, is love.

161
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:48,842
And this innocence resides within us below the Kundalini

162
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:56,165
and in my next lecture in the same hall
I will be speaking in details about it,

163
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,658
how it manifests other aspects in our life.

164
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:04,347
But why this is an important point,

165
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:10,873
that it is placed lower than the Kundalini-because it says

166
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:20,126
that our excretion is done by pelvic plexus which is manifested

167
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:25,185
by this particular centre called as Mooladhara Chakra,

168
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,111
has nothing to do with Kundalini.

169
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,852
It is very important to know this fact,

170
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:36,675
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini.

171
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:42,944
If sexual manifestation is going to take you to God,

172
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:47,320
animals would be much faster in their evolution than you are.

173
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:50,272
We have nothing to learn from animals.

174
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,312
We are human beings.

175
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:57,531
Those who want to learn from animals will become animals.

176
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,899
Are we to become the frogs and earthworms now,

177
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:04,047
or we have to become a superior personality?

178
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,800
A personality who is completely in command,

179
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:16,712
who is the master. Or are we to be slaves of our problems ?

180
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:26,458
How can we become masters of ourselves
if we give in to our own being,

181
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:31,747
to things that destroy us.

182
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,922
So one has to understand this point very very clearly,

183
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:39,302
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini.

184
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:45,946
It cannot 1 Before us is placed Christ.

185
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:50,175
I’m surprised that people who have known Christ,

186
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,210
how can they accept such an absurd thing, like by doing sex

187
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,167
in a perverted manner you will reach God.

188
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:02,870
Are we now going to become just sex points?

189
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,549
Have we no self-esteem left in ourselves,

190
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,520
to understand that we are much more
than a sex point, a mere sex point.

191
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:17,733
This is the best way of ruining people.

192
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,401
This is the best way of enticing people,

193
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,479
but I tell you, you are seekers, out and out you are seekers!

194
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,464
You must not listen until you have found out your spirit.

195
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:35,134
You are not going to be satisfied with all these nonsensical ideas.

196
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:40,581
You will come back, I know,
one day all of you will have to come back.

197
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:43,243
But that time you will be so ruined,

198
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,774
that I may not be able to help you.

199
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,753
It’s a very clear-cut thing to understand,

200
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:56,238
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini awakening.

201
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,636
She is your pure Mother,

202
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,130
She is the Mother who is individually with you.

203
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:08,678
Forget your concepts, and forget your identifications.

204
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:12,078
Please try to understand. She is your Mother,

205
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:15,984
waiting for ages to give you your real birth.

206
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,661
She is the Holy Ghost within you.

207
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:21,726
She has to give you your realization,

208
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:26,042
and She’s just waiting and waiting to do it.

209
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,871
I have seen some people, who have a Kundalini,

210
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:36,648
which just, like a wounded
serpent is bending Her head all sides and just

211
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:41,277
breaking Her body;

212
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,946
I have seen people with holes in the Kundalini;

213
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:49,543
how much we have harmed ourselves by foolish ideas,

214
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:54,034
by listening to those people
who are just trying to make money out of us,

215
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:58,800
and befool us. There are some destroying forces
that have come on this earth.

216
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:01,789
Not some, but many and they are very speedy.

217
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:03,929
It’s very easy to destroy something,

218
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,449
but to construct is such a difficult thing

219
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:10,347
and to construct something, living is even more difficult

220
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:16,917
Just we are enamored because we think it’s easy.

221
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,480
There are people

222
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:22,781
who think that if you enroll yourself as somebody’s disciple

223
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,553
you’ll be saved. How can you be saved?

224
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,601
You have to grow yourself.

225
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:30,746
You have to become.

226
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:35,242
You must know what powers have you got from any one of them.

227
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:41,057
Those who say that you should have sexual freedom,

228
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:45,256
O! The animals have all that, what is so special

229
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:50,197
about getting a sexual freedom. I can’t understand.

230
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:53,986
I mean in India you know how much people are producing children

231
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:56,916
without going to any one of these gurus.

232
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,339
On the contrary these gurus make you impotent

233
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:07,124
and they teach you about the sex

234
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,417
so that you feel as if the sexual act is
a very big thing to be achieved;

235
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,601
it’s such a simple thing to do

236
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:19,640
and for people who are impotent it is a great thing,

237
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:24,089
no doubt, but for people who are normal and natural

238
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:28,049
it’s so simple, just like going to the bathroom.

239
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:33,737
Why make such an ado about things which are so simple.

240
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:40,398
This has gone too far now. They have also suggested that,

241
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:43,952
you can raise the Kundalini by sex.

242
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,097
It’s like the Mother

243
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:49,530
being connected to the child in a very dirty manner.

244
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:52,421
People might say the Freud talked about it.

245
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:56,288
Freud was another half-baked fellow, I must say.

246
00:20:56,816 --> 00:21:00,663
Absolutely half-baked without any wisdom about him.

247
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:04,116
He must have had some problems like that himself,

248
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:07,320
he was an abnormal personality to begin with.

249
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:10,346
Apart from that all these, psychologists

250
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:14,585
meet only abnormal people. Do they meet ever a normal personality?

251
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:17,848
Who will go to a psychologist who is normal ?

252
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:20,062
Always mad people go to them.

253
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,230
And these psychologists catch from the mad, and become mad.

254
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:31,739
And then they start teaching
you something which is really maddening.

255
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:36,749
Now he was so half-baked that he just saw one side of our life.

256
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,666
He didn’t know that there was another side and another side.

257
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:45,329
And for him sex became so important,

258
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:55,192
he could see perversions and things
and we are really flabbergasted at that.

259
00:21:55,427 --> 00:21:58,961
Those who are simple people, say in Indian villages,

260
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:02,126
if you tell them like this
they’ll say what’s wrong with the fellow ?

261
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,294
He must go to lunatic asylum.

262
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,329
Now we have to see what have we achieved

263
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,059
so far as a human being?

264
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:18,521
What are we as a human being and what we have to achieve?

265
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:25,539
If you see in this diagram
(of course you should not take me for granted either).

266
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,732
Today as in the T.V. they asked me a question,

267
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:33,412
that, do you mind if we doubt,
I said no, on the contrary, I’m very happy,

268
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:35,911
it shows that you are so very free,

269
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:37,690
You have to ask me questions,

270
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:41,010
but when it comes to these fake gurus, you just go headlong.

271
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:45,434
You are so mesmerized you do not even think what you are doing!

272
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,934
And you don’t even see what others have achieved.

273
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,479
You see some people jumping on the street,

274
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:53,569
you also join them.

275
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:58,002
You don’t want to find out what power they have achieved,

276
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,260
what is their situation, are they better off than us or not

277
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:05,229
if they have been cured of their troubles or not.

278
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,958
On the contrary if you find them you’ll find that they’re recluses.

279
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:15,622
They’re even afraid sometimes, I’ve seen, of vegetables.

280
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:20,680
If you show them a garlic, they’ll be frightened.

281
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,626
Some of the gurus have this problem also.

282
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:26,638
They are told that you should not take any garlic,

283
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:29,509
so, if you show them a garlic, they’ll start jumping.

284
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,247
What is this?

285
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:35,329
Are we going to be frightened of garlic ?

286
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:40,719
Are we going to be that kind of

287
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:44,535
a horrible human beings who are frightened of this and that.

288
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,577
Now, within us lies on the left hand side, if you see,

289
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:53,506
is the power of desire which comes more from the right.

290
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:58,835
In Sanskrit it is called as Itcha Shakti.

291
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:05,983
This is the psyche about which Mr. Freud has talked,

292
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:12,109
part of it. You see he’s a blind man
leading everyone into doom, like him.

293
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:17,734
Now this one is our past, is our conditioning,

294
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,300
is the one that is our subconscious mind

295
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,050
and we have a subconscious mind no doubt.

296
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:31,134
But that’s not everything that we have, we have many other things.

297
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,684
Now this subconscious mind within us has an area beyond it

298
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,908
as the collective subconscious

299
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:42,099
and that’s a dangerous area when you enter into that area,

300
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,528
you contract diseases like cancer.

301
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:52,051
You know that in Sahaja Yoga, we have definitely cured cancer.

302
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:57,484
And I was amazed that those people who have got cancer

303
00:24:57,601 --> 00:25:04,120
and who came to me have got cured,
were all affected more by the left side than the right side.

304
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:10,560
And that you can find out yourself once you get your enlightenment

305
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:17,617
and you become a realized soul.
On the right band side there is another power,

306
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:24,052
which is called as the power of action.

307
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:28,201
You desire something, and you have to act is Kriya Shakti.

308
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:40,259
This is the future. Beyond the future lies the supraconscious area,

309
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:42,349
or the collective supraconscious.

310
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:46,450
People have talked about it
without telling you where is it within us.

311
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:49,532
They have talked about Christ. Where is Christ within us?

312
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:52,560
They have talked about Krishna, where is Krishna within us?

313
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:57,364
What is the proof that He exists
at that particular centre within us?

314
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,777
In the centre lies

315
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:04,606
another power by which we have become human beings.

316
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:07,533
The evolutionary power, the sustenance power,

317
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:14,018
the Religo, the religion,
not the religion that we see but THE religion.

318
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:23,608
Carbon has four valencies,
gold has a quality that it is untarnishable,

319
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:28,254
in the same way a human being has got ten sustenances within it.

320
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:33,435
And this sustenance which sustains it,
which says he’s a human being,

321
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,150
is the quality of a human being.

322
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:43,317
So, we have three powers within us, in Sahaja Yoga language

323
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:46,408
we call it differently, to make it simpler.

324
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:52,966
These three powers exist within us.

325
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,954
But the central power is a little cut off ,
if you see, there’s a gap.

326
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,560
This central power by which we evolve,

327
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:05,373
has not yet been connected with the mains

328
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,607
You are aware as human beings

329
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:13,552
but we are not connected to the mains

330
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,384
and the cord is the Kundalini.

331
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:22,224
In our heart resides the spirit. In our heart it resides.

332
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,220
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

333
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:31,774
Unless and until you have got your self-realization,

334
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:34,806
unless and until you are connected with it,

335
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,704
every religion, everything that you do

336
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:43,079
has no meaning, it’s like telephoning
a person without any connection.

337
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:49,797
You spoil it. So you have to get connected.

338
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,781
As today they asked me another question,
which was interesting, about Hatha Yoga.

339
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:58,371
I said nobody’s doing Hatha Yoga, they are doing some exercises

340
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:02,551
most indiscriminately. Because attention is on the body,

341
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:07,381
and that’s why they’re just doing something without understanding

342
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:10,478
why certain exercises have to be done.

343
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,631
Actually the real Hatha Yoga of Patanjali,

344
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,993
you have to have Ishwara Pranidhan;

345
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,807
that means first your God must be established!

346
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:21,877
First you must be connected.

347
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,600
Let the Kundalini rise and then know what chakras are catching,

348
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:28,576
what exercises are needed?

349
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:32,928
What mantra is needed? We have a great

350
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,768
organizations in this country,
and everywhere else where they give a mantra,

351
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:45,815
Now just think of it ! There are six centres;

352
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:50,092
these are the basic centres, there are many more,

353
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,803
I don’t want to tell you the number, otherwise you’ll be surprised.

354
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,780
But six main centres and two on the left and the right are

355
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:06,985
sun and the moon. And at the bottom is the seventh one.

356
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:10,074
So you can see there are nine centres,

357
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,760
basically we have to know
and there are nine deities on these nine centres.

358
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:20,007
How can you give somebody one mantra?

359
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:24,388
Supposing you have to pass through six gates

360
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,467
and you have only one pass,

361
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,622
of the fifth one and you are at the first gate,

362
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,559
how will you pass through?

363
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,110
These people have no idea

364
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:38,802
And they have given such horrible mantras I was shocked,

365
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:43,392
If you tell Indians they’ll be surprised. One of them means

366
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,577
‘tinga’ means (thumb). Can you
imagine this could be a mantra, like this.

367
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:51,443
it’s such a ridiculous thing to say.

368
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,802
Horrible things like ‘inga binga dinga’,

369
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:58,201
these are no mantras, this is nonsense!

370
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:01,639
And it’s a mafia going on.

371
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:05,955
They come and tell you in your ears,
you see you are not to tell it to anybody,

372
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:10,525
I was most surprised that at the end it was the ‘fallopian tubes’.

373
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,532
I said what? Fallopian tubes how can that be a mantra.

374
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:22,618
And we take it We take it, we pay for it ; people had paid £3,000

375
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,138
and they are given to eat for one week for £3,000,

376
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:37,575
the boiled soup of the boiled potatoes.

377
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,556
Just that water, for 5 days!

378
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,668
and one day the rind and one day the potatoes,

379
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:51,571
to make them weak so that they could become completely

380
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,903
out of their minds and then they can be mesmerized very well.

381
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:01,836
Be careful about these horrible people!

382
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,013
They know that you are seekers, and ardently you are seeking.

383
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,214
They know that you have money

384
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:12,724
and they want to play upon your ego by saying that you can pay,

385
00:31:12,842 --> 00:31:15,830
you must pay, how much money have you got?

386
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:18,979
These are all parasites, of the worst type!

387
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:22,109
These are all parasites, remember,

388
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:24,619
and the day will come when you recognize them,

389
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,916
when you’ll be falling on the streets
with epilepsy and all kinds of diseases

390
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:32,061
and then you’ll be coming to me. There are already so many people

391
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,827
who are coming to me in that condition.

392
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,279
I have to warn you again and again,

393
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:40,369
be careful and understand

394
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:43,722
that these people give no knowledge whatsoever,

395
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:47,615
they are just mesmerizing you, just mesmerizing you,

396
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,560
not only because they want to make money

397
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:55,131
but they are bent upon destroying the Kingdom of God.

398
00:31:55,424 --> 00:31:57,958
They are bent upon destroying you all

399
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,347
because they are satanic people

400
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:04,335
and they want to establish the kingdom of Satan.

401
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:11,687
For us, it is easy to take to these things, it’s very easy to fall,

402
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:17,136
as I told you. But to rise is difficult.
It’s not so difficult also,

403
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,620
spontaneity is so simple, if you know the job you can do it.

404
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:25,585
If there’s a beautiful garden

405
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,195
you can easily find out that there must be
a gardener behind it who has done the job.

406
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,916
If somebody knows the job he can do it.

407
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,243
Now this central path is the path through which one has to rise.

408
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:49,727
The Kundalini rises through a very thin line of Brahmanadi.
It's called  Brahmanadi.

409
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,673
In the beginning only a hair like thing rises,

410
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:59,357
it pierces through; in some people,
of course, in a big way it rises also.

411
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:06,505
And then it pierces this
fontanel bone area which is a real baptism, real.

412
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:10,391
Today only, people felt the cool breeze coming out of their heads.

413
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,741
Can you do that by jumping, or by paying money?

414
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,958
They felt the cool breeze in the hand.

415
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,576
It’s written in the Bible, even in the Bible very clearly,

416
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:25,849
that it’s the cool breeze,
cool breeze is the sign of the Holy Ghost.

417
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,342
You start feeling the cool breeze in your hands

418
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:32,056
and you start feeling the cool breeze on your head.

419
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,310
This is the actualization. Of course, you people don’t read

420
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,347
other books which are very good, like Adi Shankaracharya,

421
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:43,204
People don’t even like the mention of his name

422
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:49,630
who has really and clearly said
that it is the cool breeze; the chaitanya

423
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,904
is to be felt like cool breeze in the hands.

424
00:33:54,826 --> 00:34:00,724
They do not want that you should know the truth.

425
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,196
And this is the truth that when you get your realization,

426
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:08,886
you have to feel the cool breeze in your hands yourself.

427
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:12,709
You have to judge yourself. I’m not going to tell you,

428
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,976
it is you who has to see, it is you who has to feel,

429
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:20,917
and then you have to grow and you have to know all and everything,

430
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,195
all the secrets of Divine Science.

431
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:28,921
You become the master then, you are the guru.

432
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:34,470
You are the Spirit, and you should get it,
it’s your own which is given to you.

433
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:37,706
I have nothing to do about it,

434
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,909
I’m just a catalyst. I should say,

435
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:44,011
you can do it yourself,
once you get realization you can give realization.

436
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:47,820
Actually Warren came to me, and Terence,

437
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:54,538
and they had been really lynched by all these gurus,
and they were so unhappy.

438
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:58,109
Just before leaving for India he telephoned to me

439
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:00,488
from Australia telephone to me:

440
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:04,238
"Mother, we have got your telephone, can we come and see you?"

441
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:08,124
and I knew they were seekers. So first, I caught hold of them.

442
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:11,441
You see, I don’t work much in the cities,

443
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:15,660
I work in the villages because
villagers are easier to get realization;

444
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:18,335
the other day we were in a village called Kadus,

445
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,920
where six thousand people got realization,

446
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,142
it was announced in the paper. So,

447
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,364
in the cities these gurus work out because they want money

448
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:30,373
and the purse, you see, it’s there in the cities.

449
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,787
I work in the villages. Poor things had to go to the

450
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:36,185
villages where they don’t even have proper bathrooms,

451
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,291
you have to go to the rivers to have your bath and things

452
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:42,981
and it was very spartan for comfortable Australians.

453
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,658
But they managed it somehow.

454
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,573
And they got their realization and when they got it,

455
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:52,881
when they came back here they have given realization

456
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,215
 in the first shot to 300 people.

457
00:35:56,626 --> 00:36:01,020
And now they know such a lot about Kundalini,

458
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,141
about awakening, about enlightenment.

459
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,089
It’s all logical after realization,

460
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,747
before that it is blind rationality,

461
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,627
which doesn’t understand anything,

462
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:20,548
This Kundalini is there, your own, Sahaja.

463
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:25,470
‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born;
it’s born with you, it’s within you!

464
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:32,579
It has to only rise with authority, with a person who knows

465
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:36,452
how to do it, One should not feel hurt about it,

466
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:40,334
because I’m doing it, you better do it, I’ll be very happy.

467
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:45,139
You see, I’m a very happily married woman, you know,
I don’t need anything.

468
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:49,944
My husband has permitted me to
go about doing this because he knows nobody can do it.

469
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:55,259
I’ll be very happy if you can do it, really I would like to retire.

470
00:36:56,429 --> 00:37:00,705
Moreover why should you feel bad if I do it?

471
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:05,160
After all there are so many things
I can’t do. I can’t drive, I can’t type,

472
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,109
I don’t know even how to open your tins,

473
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:10,668
I’m so hopelessly bad.

474
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:16,527
So what is there to feel bad about it
if I know how to raise the Kundalini

475
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,465
and when it is your right to know yourself

476
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:26,051
and to get it within yourself
so that you achieve your real baptism,

477
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,560
your real force, and once you have achieved it,

478
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:37,542
first thing that happens is
that you become a different personality.

479
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,753
You become something so different.

480
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:44,362
The other day a gentleman, old man,

481
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,292
who met me in Singapore long time back,

482
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:50,496
he told me that : ‘Mother, after realization,

483
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,382
actually I’ve not even touched it fully,

484
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,117
but one thing happened to me I just gave up gambling,

485
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:58,831
smoking and drinking, just like that.

486
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:03,324
What happened to me? I said,
when you have found out the real, you give up.

487
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:07,972
When you have found the real diamond,
of course, you give up the artificial ones.

488
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,576
Because you are bored stiff, because

489
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,867
you find life so boring, human beings so boring, life so boring,

490
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:20,061
so uninteresting, full of tensions,
full of cruelty, full of problems,

491
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:21,897
you want to take to these things.

492
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,807
But once you’ve found out your absolute,

493
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,006
your sense of security is absolutely established.

494
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:32,491
And the joy and happiness, the bliss that is promised to you,

495
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:38,064
starts pouring down into you. You feel so relaxed.

496
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:41,639
Apart from that, so many things happen to you

497
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:45,721
that it is hard to tell you in this one lecture.

498
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:49,089
I’m going to have many other lectures for you.

499
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,447
Now first thing that happens is that physically you get fit,

500
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:57,900
It’s not that I’m going to go to
the hospital to find out who are physically unfit

501
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:01,884
and start an enterprise. Alright, pay so much money

502
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:04,400
to cure this disease and all that. No,

503
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:08,752
I do not know how many people I’ve cured,
really I do not know, believe me.

504
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:11,603
And I do not know how many of my disciples have cured.

505
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:17,159
It’s like the sun shining, it does not
know how many leaves have become green.

506
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,076
You do not keep notes of people whom you love,

507
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,066
and whom you feed… Do you write down how many morsels

508
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:28,115
you have fed the person, do you?

509
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:32,685
This is love. Why do you need the proof ?

510
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,927
Why do you need, you are not paying me anything?

511
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,884
Do you want to have any proof of the sun?

512
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:44,620
You are not giving me anything!
I’m not selling anything! There’s no shop on!

513
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:49,619
You have to get this gift. You have to get it.

514
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:54,904
So why do you want to judge me?
If you don’t get it, better try for it.

515
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:59,619
What are you going to gain by knowing about me,
it’s not easy to know about me.

516
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:03,159
It’s very very difficult. I’m such a camouflage.

517
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,892
It’s a very difficult thing to know.
Better thing is, you know yourself, then you’ll learn.

518
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,675
Unless and until you know yourself, you won’t know me,

519
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,819
so no use asking me questions which are rather embarrassing,

520
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:20,337
I won’t be able to tell you; because I’ve become very clever now.

521
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:23,107
Krishna, just told one person, Arjuna.

522
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:34,271
He said, give up everything and follow me.

523
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,032
He said that after Yoga you’ll get the Kshema, means, well-being.

524
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:42,492
Not before you get a well-being, after that

525
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:45,730
because when the Kundalini rises as I will tell you later on.

526
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:47,882
If the centers are enlighten

527
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:50,740
as a result of that you get the well-being,

528
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,803
physically, mentally, emotionally,
materially, socially, in every way.

529
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,633
And spiritually (unclear)

530
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:03,344
He said after Yoga it will happen! not before that.

531
00:41:03,832 --> 00:41:07,832
And that’s what is going to happen to you, when you get it.

532
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:10,903
If you don’t get it today, don’t get disappointed.

533
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,283
I work for days in and days out

534
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:16,464
and some people have been really very difficult

535
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,377
in that great England,

536
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,812
the Jerusalem, according to William Blake,

537
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,484
I have to work very very hard.

538
00:41:25,742 --> 00:41:30,097
I’ve worked on only six people for four years, can you believe it?

539
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:33,139
Very difficult nuts to be cracked, you see.

540
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,909
But once they were cracked it has blown up like anything.

541
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:42,135
And now we have thousands of people who are realized.

542
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,069
Of course. I do not keep any records of them,

543
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,539
there is no organization, nothing,

544
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,413
You know them through your vibrations

545
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,487
by which you know that they are realized or not.

546
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,772
Because you become collectively conscious,

547
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:59,385
you become; again and again I say, it’s the becoming.

548
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:03,799
You start feeling others and you start feeling yourself.

549
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:07,334
it is important, vital,

550
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,777
absolutely the thing for you to do.

551
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,430
You have to get it, if not today then tomorrow.

552
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,323
Why not do it today, it’s a good idea.

553
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:20,719
But after getting it one has to know that,

554
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:23,518
as Christ has described, some seed fell...

555
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:31,960
but after getting it one has to know

556
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,872
that as Christ has described some seed fell on the rock,

557
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:41,271
 in the same way it happens, you have to look after it,

558
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:45,323
you have to make it grow, you have to master it,

559
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:48,299
and you have to become the guru yourself.

560
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,987
And as I told you this morning,

561
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,080
you better go and ask ail these gurus to pay back the money.

562
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:02,603
This is best way we can understand that it is beyond rationality.

563
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,373
I’m talking about the unlimited; our rationality is limited,

564
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:09,829
our brains are limited. But many ,things can be understood.

565
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:14,127
So many people reached the conclusion
that it is the Kundalini awakening,

566
00:43:14,245 --> 00:43:17,310
is the one which is going to give us self-realization.

567
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,279
Through their limited brain only, they reached it.

568
00:43:20,436 --> 00:43:22,838
They also reached so many conclusions,

569
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:28,599
that like persons like Jung, the disciple of Mr. Freud the great,

570
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,364
was such a sensible man that he said you must get your realization,

571
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:34,572
you must get your self-realization,

572
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,010
and he prepared the ground for Sahaja Yoga, for he said,

573
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,510
when you get your self-realization,

574
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:44,561
you will become collectively conscious. He talked about it.

575
00:43:45,061 --> 00:43:46,794
So, one has to understand

576
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:51,760
that this is not only what I’m saying, this has been said

577
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,507
by all the great saints, by all the incarnations,
by all the great prophets.

578
00:43:58,016 --> 00:44:00,949
Mohammad said, you have to become the Peer.

579
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:05,174
But you know what they’re doing about religion now.

580
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:08,112
I do not want to fall into controversies

581
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:13,125
but you can yourself judge,
what have they done out, of these incarnations.

582
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:17,645
You give anything to human beings
they know how to make a mess out of it.

583
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,696
You give them the best thing,

584
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:22,654
the highest, they know how to spoil it.

585
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:28,539
Like, I would say that Hindus were told,

586
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:32,504
that Atma, the spirit resides in everybody.

587
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:40,433
They had no business to start the different caste system,

588
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:46,686
which depends on the birth. Actually Jati (caste) means a person

589
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:50,319
born with certain aptitudes. For example you are Brahmins,

590
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,608
because you are Seekers,

591
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:54,088
you are seeking the Brahma, so you are Brahmins.

592
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:59,323
Those who are seeking the power say, we seek in elections

593
00:44:59,753 --> 00:45:04,303
are Kshatryas. Like that, these are the

594
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:09,034
aptitudes of personalities which determine a person’s birth.

595
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,820
Actually the one who has written Gita himself, was Vyasa,

596
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,652
was an illegitimate child

597
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:20,164
of a fisherwoman and how could he say that you are born

598
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:22,834
in a Brahmin family.

599
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:30,691
It’s a capacity, a category.
You are in the category of those Seekers.

600
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:33,974
You are the ones who are going to get realization,

601
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:38,625
that’s why you are the Brahmins, and this category can be anywhere.

602
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:42,155
It can be in Islamic world, it can be in China,

603
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:47,263
and it can be in Russia,
it can be in England, and it is in Australia.

604
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:52,784
I have, through my husband’s job, been to all these countries.

605
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:56,743
I was amazed. I’ve given realization even to Russians,

606
00:45:56,945 --> 00:45:59,278
they’re very good for realization.

607
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,491
But they’ll take time to understand it to that extent.

608
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,894
Because you are really free people;

609
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:11,124
you are the people who are free, democratic, can have more

610
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:17,036
open mind, to understand Sahaja Yoga,
to achieve it to much greater heights.

611
00:46:17,804 --> 00:46:22,005
But still I would like to say that
freedom doesn’t mean abandonment.

612
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:27,118
It doesn’t mean that. Say in a plane if all the parts of the plane

613
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:31,688
want to have freedom, what will happen to the plane, ultimately?

614
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:34,692
We are part and parcel of one whole being.

615
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:40,184
One primordial Being, the macrocosm, and we are cells.

616
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:44,559
We have to relate ourselves to the whole and so we have to find out

617
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:50,458
our relationship, the coordination between different cells,

618
00:46:50,743 --> 00:46:53,680
the love, the love between.

619
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:58,519
Last of all I would like to say it is the Divine Love of God,

620
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:03,316
is the grace of God which has made you a human being

621
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:07,581
and it is His grace which is going to
make you a supreme human being.

622
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:11,597
Because He wants to have that power to flow through you,

623
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:15,824
to make you a hollow personality; like the flute of Shri Krishna,

624
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,077
so that you might feel His power and you maneuver it.

625
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,401
And you enter into the Kingdom of God,

626
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:26,407
because He is the father who loves you,

627
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,108
loves more than any father can love.

628
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:34,863
He’s the Ocean of Love. He forgives all your so-called guilts;

629
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:39,296
what guilts can we have, what sins can we commit,

630
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:43,867
only you are like little birds who sometimes feel guilty

631
00:47:43,984 --> 00:47:47,245
for bringing a little straw from outside in the house.

632
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,433
He is a loving Father,

633
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,703
He is a Father who is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

634
00:47:53,594 --> 00:47:56,421
He cleanses us completely,

635
00:47:56,578 --> 00:48:03,257
and He grants His beauty to us, and you become His own children,

636
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:06,656
who have been granted all His powers,

637
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,800
in their own beauty and its glory,

638
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:11,577
May God bless you!

639
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,710
May I have some water please.

640
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:23,969
Now, there is a way sometimes people want to ask some questions

641
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:31,194
and they very anxious to ask some questions
sometimes you see they ask also useless questions.

642
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:33,928
Vasting the time.

643
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,099
Now, if you're hungry actually you should ask for realization

644
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:44,060
and see that it works. Sometimes
these questions can divert your attention.

645
00:48:44,197 --> 00:48:47,615
Is better to have your realization first,

646
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,352
and then ask questions.

647
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,207
But the first lecture of introduction,

648
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,820
I think is better that you ask Me a few questions,

649
00:48:56,385 --> 00:49:00,779
it's better without any fear I am you Mother (unclear)

650
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:03,377
you have to ask questions.

651
00:49:03,865 --> 00:49:06,932
There is somebody putting a guilty hand there.

652
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:10,986
You have to ask loudly. I can't here you.

653
00:49:11,255 --> 00:49:14,256
Are there any dangers... (unclear)

654
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,187
Not at all.

655
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,367
That's a very good thing. Not at all.

656
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,727
Not at all, she is your Mother.

657
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:25,068
You see, the mother takes all
the weapon upon herself

658
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:27,561
when she give guard. This is the Earthly mother,

659
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:30,946
the heavenly mother. No dangers of any kind.

660
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:33,215
But these people are not authorized.

661
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:35,965
It's like somebody from the village comes and he doesn't

662
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:40,012
know the electricity and puts his hands to plugs and said "I got a shok".

663
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:41,592
Naturally you will.

664
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:45,484
The one who knows the job,

665
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,574
knows also how to raise the Kundalini.

666
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:51,694
She is your Mother, there is no danger at all. Not at all.

667
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:57,277
Attendee: Do the gurus....unclear.

668
00:49:57,555 --> 00:50:00,531
Yes, of course, I mean that's what I'm going to make you.

669
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:04,023
Your'e going to awaken others Kundalini no doubt!

670
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:06,629
Yes, yes, houndred times.

671
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:10,359
Attendee: How

672
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:12,663
Because you have to become.

673
00:50:13,474 --> 00:50:16,669
First you have to become,
it is very simple which I'll tell you later,

674
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:18,388
all right, how to do it.

675
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:30,831
A: unclear

676
00:50:31,397 --> 00:50:33,502
It's for Me to judge.

677
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,366
It's for Me to judge.

678
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:38,879
I don't find any will persons much.

679
00:50:39,097 --> 00:50:42,657
There are people who are misguided, who have lost their way.

680
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:46,202
Very few evil people in this world, very few.

681
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,532
Actually seekers are not at all,

682
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:52,234
poor things they are play in to the hands of evil forces.

683
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:53,653
I've been ruoled,

684
00:50:54,497 --> 00:50:57,897
sometimes I feel to see the way they are exploited.

685
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:00,239
But they are not bad.

686
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:03,394
They are not bad people at all. They are seekers,

687
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:06,370
absolutely beatiful things.

688
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:13,572
Do not think that you are evil, never think that way. It hurts me.

689
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:23,455
Yogi: Are we going to raise Kundalini tonight?
SM: Just now!

690
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:39,651
Yogi: He is asking wheter
the Chaitanya is the last Avatar of Krishna.

691
00:51:41,774 --> 00:51:52,329
Chaitanya means, the All Pervading Divine Power of God,

692
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:57,805
which is Love Divine love. It means Chaitanya - is all Pranava.

693
00:51:58,057 --> 00:52:07,171
It has many names it has.
In Sanskrit it is called as the Bred, Ruh.

694
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:13,895
And in the Bible is called Breath the Holy Ghost.

695
00:52:14,493 --> 00:52:18,847
It's bible, is the power by which is the whole universe is ruled.

696
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:24,859
By which everything that is continious takes place.

697
00:52:25,879 --> 00:52:30,053
These three powers are the three aspects of the same.

698
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:33,803
But when you get your realization, you get the integrated force.

699
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:38,577
Actually when we consider,

700
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:42,255
analysing a person we are really dividing him.

701
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,291
For example you have mayt a doktor
for one eye and another for the other.

702
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:49,358
 But Chaitanya integrates you completely.

703
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:55,349
And the whole power is the divitly power 
of our prana, which is the right-sided

704
00:52:55,374 --> 00:53:02,110
of our manasa which is the left-sided 
and of our dharma which is the centre.

705
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,688
 All these are integrated.

706
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:27,711
A: not clear

707
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:32,016
Complain is correct. Is correct complained.

708
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,707
What's your age now?

709
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,694
A: 30
SM: Only thirty?

710
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:41,308
About then years back, when you were hardly twenty years

711
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:45,123
I have proclaimed it. But nowbody wanted to belive Me.

712
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:49,089
Is the human beings who are to be blaimed for that.

713
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:54,321
Who chrossified Christ?
Why did not recognize? I'm to ask many questions.

714
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,219
Why did not recognize Him?

715
00:53:58,562 --> 00:54:00,895
Why did you not recognize Krishna?

716
00:54:01,062 --> 00:54:03,196
Why did you not recognize Rama?

717
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,697
Why did you not recognize any saintly personality?

718
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:10,702
But this fake horrible things. Why did you recognize them?

719
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:16,908
I talked about all of them, very openly whitout any fear.

720
00:54:17,146 --> 00:54:20,015
Then years back I went to America

721
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:26,603
and everything. But see, where is americans gone now?
Gone mad... They're gone mad.
