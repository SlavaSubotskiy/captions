1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,709
This centre what we call as "left Vishuddhi".

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,458
Now have you told them about left Vishuddhi?

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,458
Not, not specific sides, you know, just the general principle.

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,542
All right. Now, this left Vishuddhi comes to you

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,000
if you have said mantras wrongly.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,959
You see, the mantras are to be said only when there is

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:22,999
a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:27,792
And if you do not know

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,917
about it, you accept the mantras.

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,625
Anybody who tells you, "Say this mantra", you just start saying it,

11
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:41,333
without understanding, whether it is given by an authority or not.

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,792
Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not.

13
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:47,709
Maybe it is not required for some.

14
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,333
Any particular mantra may not be required.

15
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,709
And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things.

16
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,208
So mantras also, it's a very big science.

17
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,166
And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,333
Also one feels it, even if you have not taken mantras, if

19
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,166
you have been feeling guilty.

20
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:11,709
Like, you see, if you are used to confessions and things like that,

21
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:17,250
if you are used to a situation where you feel that

22
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:22,999
"I'm guilty for this". You know, the norms of today's modern life

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,999
are so funny, that even for small thing you have to feel guilty.

24
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,250
For example if you put the fork in a wrong way,

25
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,083
you feel guilty: "Oh God, I should not have done this."

26
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,166
Like that, the life is so complicated,

27
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,458
but very, very small things can also make you feel guilty.

28
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:43,291
So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,375
Now, this centre is very important, because

30
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:55,125
if this centre is not all right, then Kundalini doesn't rise.

31
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,667
She pulls

32
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,583
this, at this point. Half of it is pulled out.

33
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:05,917
And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise.

34
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:10,083
Now, one should not feel guilty about anything, whatsoever!

35
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,750
There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions

36
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,375
and all the time saying, "I am such a sinner"

37
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:20,083
and I should not have done this and I should not have done that.

38
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:25,417
Because, as I told you yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

39
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:31,667
He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness.

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,125
So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves.

41
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,625
Moreover you are the temple of God.

42
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,709
And if you condemn yourself like that,

43
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:45,625
that "I'm good for nothing, I am useless",

44
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:50,375
then you are condemning that temple which is created by God.

45
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,458
You have not created yourself.

46
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,959
So you have no right to condemn yourself.

47
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,750
Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter.

48
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,792
Because I am talking of the ocean.

49
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:04,333
So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected.

50
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,208
So one should not feel guilty.

51
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:09,250
Now see, are you feeling the vibrations now? Let's see.
