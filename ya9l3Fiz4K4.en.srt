1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:07,289
Today we are here to worship

2
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:13,416
the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:22,384
And also to thank Him

4
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:27,383
for giving us

5
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:36,883
an ideal life of a saint

6
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:42,398
who has to work

7
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:46,218
for the benevolence of the whole world.

8
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:54,701
We talk of Christ,

9
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:58,623
we sing of Shri Ganesha,

10
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:06,366
we say we believe in Him,

11
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:13,107
specially Sahaj Yogis feel He is the eldest brother that they have,

12
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:21,425
and a tremendous

13
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:34,293
surrender I find, among Western Sahaj Yogis specially, for Christ.

14
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:39,250
Because they were born in Christian religion perhaps, maybe,

15
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:44,493
or maybe that they found Christ’s life

16
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:48,399
a very special one.

17
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:55,537
But to Sahaj Yoga He has to be much more than that,

18
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,177
and to you Sahaj Yogis.

19
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:05,216
Many people believe in many deities.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,204
Like some believe in Shri Krishna, some in Shri Rama,

21
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:14,240
some in Buddha, some in Mahavira and some in Christ.

22
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:18,475
All over the world they do believe

23
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:23,092
in some higher being.

24
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:30,770
But this belief is without the connection, to begin with,

25
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:39,167
and becomes a kind of a

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,400
falsehood that they think that

27
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,658
Christ belongs to them, Rama belongs to them

28
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,816
or Shri Krishna belongs to them.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,977
That they are the possessors of all these deities

30
00:02:56,178 --> 00:03:01,251
because they have obliged of believing into it.

31
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,121
And that is how most of the faiths have come.

32
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,611
And though they ardently believe in Christ,

33
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:17,142
all these faiths have failed.

34
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,850
Because when they believed in Christ, they believed that

35
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:26,786
through Christ they can get their cheques cashed.

36
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,927
It was like a bank.

37
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,743
You pray to God: "You get me all right."  All right.

38
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:34,809
Then: "Get my mother all right,

39
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,495
my father all right, my sister all right."

40
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:42,335
"Get me so much money! Get me so much wealth!",

41
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,850
or health or anything.

42
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:51,999
Thinking that because we believe in Christ He’s so obliged

43
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:57,498
that He has to pay for it and He has to look after us

44
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:03,034
and that we are

45
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:09,156
rightful possessors of His blessings.

46
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,729
Then they form churches, temples, mosques, clubs,

47
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:19,305
believing that, “Now we belong to Christ!

48
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,987
All this group is a very special chosen one!”,

49
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:27,789
or, “We belong to Rama,”

50
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:32,121
or to Krishna or to someone like that.

51
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,728
And to whomsoever they may ‘belong,’

52
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:41,058
the one to whom they belong, does not know anything about them!

53
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,044
Christ has said, “You’ll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ,’

54
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,285
I won’t recognise you!”

55
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,101
It’s a big warning to people who say, “We believe in Christ.”

56
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:59,156
So, without the connection, if you believe in someone,

57
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,785
it has no meaning.

58
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,098
It’s just like some sort of a mythical, romantic idea

59
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:13,038
that the other person whom you believe in

60
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,078
has a special relationship with you.

61
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:25,212
So this assurance that, “I believe into something,”

62
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:28,953
or this assumption that, “I believe into something,

63
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:32,842
and because I believe into something, I have every right

64
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,173
to get all the blessings that I ask for,”

65
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:40,634
is a myth, as you must have realised after Sahaj Yoga.

66
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:44,480
But when you become a Sahaj Yogi,

67
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:48,930
then you have got your connection with all of them

68
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,587
and with Christ.

69
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,354
But this connection again, in a subtle way, is the same style.

70
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:04,342
For example, what we try to do is to ask again

71
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:08,291
that this should be done, that should be done.

72
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:15,759
“My Agnya is caught up. Mother, please clear it out!”,

73
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,868
or

74
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:24,300
“I’ve got headache so please put it right!”

75
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:28,250
Because you believe in Sahaj Yoga, you expect Sahaj Yoga

76
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,928
to feel obliged that, “See now, they believe in me,

77
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,475
 it’s such a great obligation!”

78
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,331
“So Sahaj Yoga must do something for me!”

79
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,651
Whether you do anything for Sahaj Yoga is not important.

80
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:45,073
Only because you believe in Sahaj Yoga,

81
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,887
because Sahaj Yoga has given you Realisation,

82
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:51,467
so Sahaj Yoga has every obligation

83
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,208
that it should look after you.

84
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,716
“I am in Sahaj Yoga still, why should I suffer?

85
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,835
I am in Sahaj Yoga, why should my mother not be all right?”

86
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,103
“I am in Sahaj Yoga…”

87
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,333
As if sort of an

88
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,335
organisation where you have paid money or something

89
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:15,192
and you are supposed to get all the rewards.

90
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:31,656
But now, let us see,

91
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:37,187
after Sahaj Yoga, what should be our attitude which is sane?

92
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,718
The first is that, “Now I’m a Sahaj Yogi

93
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:50,120
and now I’m connected to Christ.

94
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,753
So what is my responsibility?”

95
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,979
Christ felt responsible for the whole world!

96
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,736
He’s described in the Devi Purana

97
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,571
as the support of the whole universe.

98
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:17,772
As soon as you are connected with Christ,

99
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:21,701
the whole attitude has to change.

100
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:28,425
So to be connected with Christ means,

101
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:34,544
what are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?

102
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:38,278
That’s the minimum of minimum.

103
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:43,792
What did you get out of His life?

104
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:53,540
Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured?

105
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:59,795
He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back?

106
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,006
Shri Mataji: Do you mind removing this for me?

107
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:14,026
Or is it that His life,

108
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:18,132
which you have enshrined,

109
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,892
should also make you something

110
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,438
that could be enshrined,

111
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,056
that could be respected,

112
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:36,011
that could be called as a reflection of Christ’s life?

113
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:42,349
Now let us see His life, what kind of a life He led.

114
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:47,882
We read Bible, I mean we carry Bible everywhere

115
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:52,860
and even I saw the Bible in the hotel as if

116
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:57,800
it’s a part of the thing, like a soap is kept and Bible is!

117
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:05,583
Of course, I read it, I don’t know how many read it.

118
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:11,716
But then it doesn’t become

119
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,949
to say you are a Sahaj Yogi,

120
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,944
if through His connection

121
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:24,162
you have not received any one of His qualities.

122
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,056
For example, this is now connected to the mains,

123
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,495
so you are getting electricity through it.

124
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:35,041
This doesn’t give electricity to the mains, but it receives.

125
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,996
So you have to receive something from Him

126
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,855
and what you have to receive

127
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:48,722
is the qualities that He had.

128
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:57,298
You might say, "Because, Mother, He was Divine,

129
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:03,130
He was the son of God.”

130
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,403
But He was also a son of His Mother

131
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:12,641
and you are also son of your Mother.

132
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:19,258
So mediocrity in our character

133
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,004
cannot say that we are connected with Christ

134
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:26,541
because there’s no energy of Christ flowing in you.

135
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,752
When energy of Christ flows through you, you express it.

136
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,377
Like yesterday the gentleman was playing

137
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:39,191
and I think the power of Saraswati started flowing in him

138
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,000
and how beautiful he played!

139
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,025
He couldn’t control his fingers.

140
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:47,314
He said, “It’s all happening here: I don’t know how!”

141
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,233
So throughout, if you see His life,

142
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:01,592
He was a person

143
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,707
who was all the time bothered about the benevolence of the world.

144
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:16,984
How clearly He went and talked to the priests

145
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,881
and told them

146
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:25,869
that, “You don’t understand me because you are blind.”

147
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:32,201
He told them that He knows His Father

148
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:34,440
and His Father knows Him,

149
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:39,722
“But you do not know me, nor you know your Father.”

150
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:46,071
So openly, blatantly, He was talking.

151
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:54,806
He was not afraid that He will go to jail.

152
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,548
He was not afraid that, by saying such a thing,

153
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,241
the ego of others will be challenged;

154
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:07,452
because He was not pretentious.

155
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:10,664
He was not doing something that was not truthful.

156
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:16,249
He was telling the truth and truth has that capacity

157
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:20,149
to express itself through your personality.

158
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:26,128
But do we really believe in ourselves?

159
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,738
Do we really believe that we are Sahaj Yogis,

160
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:39,511
that we can talk to people as Christ could talk to them?

161
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,150
At a very young age of twelve years,

162
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,485
He could go and talk to the priests.

163
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,412
What courage!

164
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,646
There was no need for Him.

165
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:57,764
He should have really got married like Sahaj Yogis do

166
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:02,397
and settled down with His wife and children nicely.

167
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:08,527
Because the main headache for Sahaj Yogis seems to be the marriage

168
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,765
and their children! He never married.

169
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,407
He was so precious

170
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:21,618
that He didn’t want to waste His time with these things.

171
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,237
And He died so young, He knew that He had to die.

172
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:33,678
So in His life, you see He was not a mundane type of a personality,

173
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:37,732
not mundane, not ordinary.

174
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,720
And when He spoke with such confidence, with such

175
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:50,503
knowledge of truth that people did believe Him, had to believe.

176
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,978
They couldn’t help it.

177
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:57,955
This power you too have, and you can do the same.

178
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,333
But the way He used His power,

179
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,706
why can’t we use?

180
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:09,084
Because we are not intense about it.

181
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,950
Our attention is on something else,

182
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:18,900
which is quite frivolous, which is useless.

183
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,317
All right, we are Sahaj Yogis,

184
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:26,052
so what do we think about?

185
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:31,247
First thing we’ll think, “Now, today’s a puja, what should I wear?”

186
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,992
Then, "I haven’t yet pressed my clothes," or

187
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:41,003
"My sari’s not all right. I have to match it, and how to dress up."

188
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:47,468
All these frivolous things first come to our brain.

189
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,530
Or in the morning, when you get up in your ashrams or anywhere,

190
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:56,613
what do you think?

191
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:01,469
If it was Christ,

192
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:06,403
He would say, “I am sleeping still?

193
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:10,047
I have to meditate!

194
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:15,684
I have to be one with the Divine!”

195
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:19,462
He would not say, “No, no, the Divine will look after, it’s all right.

196
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,917
The Divine will meditate for me!”

197
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:27,017
“After all, Paramchaitanya, it has to meditate.

198
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:31,319
Why should we meditate? We are all Sahaj Yogis.”

199
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,087
“Everything is sahaj, so let the Divine meditate for us!”

200
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,147
“We can’t get up in the morning. It’s difficult.

201
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:44,189
We can’t, you see, just can’t.”

202
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,970
But then you can’t be a Sahaj Yogi!

203
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,868
You are supposed to be connected with all the deities,

204
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:54,811
not only Christ.

205
00:16:55,163 --> 00:17:01,086
And here you can’t even get out of your bed - to meditate.

206
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,108
While all the deities are already up there,

207
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,005
waiting for you to get up, that’s all.

208
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:17,898
And they can’t understand what’s happening to these Sahaj Yogis.

209
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,790
“How can they be so low?

210
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,293
After all, Mother must have given them Realisation

211
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,587
thinking them to be something great.

212
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:30,038
How did they get Realisation?

213
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,550
They’re so ordinary, so mundane, so useless!”

214
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,222
The deities start wondering,

215
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:41,882
“Why Mother gave them Realisation?”

216
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,007
Because a person, who cannot enjoy his meditation,

217
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:50,397
cannot be a Sahaj Yogi.

218
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,971
That’s the first sign of a Sahaj Yogi,

219
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,651
that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate.

220
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:15,081
That is the time you are really in connection with the Divine

221
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,717
and you enjoy the most.

222
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,280
Whenever I get a chance, I go into it.

223
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,954
I find it so difficult to come out of it!

224
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,674
I mean, for today it happened to me,

225
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:30,445
I was first thinking that I will have to struggle out for this puja.

226
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:35,674
I’ll have to work it out.

227
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:42,300
I don’t know how I will get out of this meditative mood.

228
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,671
But it surprises so many people,

229
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,930
how people are meditating.

230
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,377
Especially so many Indians told me this thing.

231
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,492
It’s something very surprising,

232
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:15,090
that they are supposed to be meditating and immediately they get up,

233
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,016
“What cakes? What things? What have you cooked?” this, that.

234
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:24,343
There’s no slumber of

235
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:30,628
meditation in them and, just, they just start thinking about food.

236
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,464
How can that be?

237
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:39,416
It’s the way you cannot get out of your sleep,

238
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:43,959
in the same way a Sahaj Yogi cannot get out of his meditative mood.

239
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:47,437
It’s so enjoyable.

240
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:50,866
You want to be there.

241
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:54,825
So one of the signs that you are not yet anywhere near Sahaj Yoga

242
00:19:55,026 --> 00:20:00,129
is that if you cannot enjoy your meditation.

243
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:08,201
I mean, imagine

244
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,585
if you enjoy a television show or anything,

245
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:15,129
you have to see it, isn’t it?

246
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,982
You cannot just say, “All right, I’m sleeping now

247
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:23,518
and I am enjoying the television.”

248
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:29,216
So you have to be awakened to it but that awakening is within,

249
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:35,186
and there you see your own connection.

250
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:39,308
It’s a joy that I cannot describe really.

251
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,624
There’s only one word for that, is nirananda,

252
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:46,226
means it’s just, 'Nira' means ‘only the joy, absolute joy’.

253
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:49,517
And who would like to give up the joy for what?

254
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:53,260
For a cake or for a tea or this thing?

255
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,631
I mean, just think of it!

256
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:04,948
The joy is so deep, so intense, so beautiful.

257
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,307
I don’t know what else to say.

258
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:13,737
You have not tasted the ambrosia,

259
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,744
otherwise you would have said, as if the

260
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:19,909
ambrosia is trickling down on your tongue.

261
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:23,192
It’s like that, the taste of it.

262
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:31,898
But what I find that the depth we have not touched.

263
00:21:32,113 --> 00:21:34,382
Which is within us. All of you have that depth.

264
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:38,269
It’s not that you don’t have. I have not given you Realisation

265
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:43,063
because you are just there, here

266
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:46,071
because you have that depth within you.

267
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,672
You are special people with that depth.

268
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:53,522
But you haven’t touched it. It shows you haven’t touched it.

269
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,948
Supposing it’s like a well full of water,

270
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,921
but you are still dangling somewhere in the middle,

271
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,677
you haven’t yet touched that depth.

272
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:07,443
Because once you get into that, you get completely drenched

273
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,554
and lost.

274
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,745
But if that is not the situation,

275
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:15,636
that shows that you are still somewhere dangling in between

276
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,572
and any time you can come high and dry.

277
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:24,353
So you have to judge yourself.

278
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:29,663
This is the time for you to judge you are in connection with Christ.

279
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,795
He achieved His resurrection,

280
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:35,081
by which we have to achieve our resurrection.

281
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:37,587
But what have we done

282
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:41,849
to achieve that resurrection which He has achieved?

283
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:45,789
He intensely

284
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,038
lived a life of complete sacrifice

285
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:55,069
and complete concentration

286
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,751
towards one goal:

287
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:02,793
that He has to achieve the resurrection.

288
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:09,754
Nothing else was important to Him.

289
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:16,273
All that attention was on one thing

290
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:23,387
that, “I have to achieve this resurrection.

291
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:28,176
I have to get crucified and I have to be resurrected,

292
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:32,743
because the whole world has to be resurrected.”

293
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,004
But Sahaj Yogis,

294
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:42,997
I don’t know how many think that way,

295
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:47,479
how many think that dedication is needed.

296
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:52,112
And the best part of it

297
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,533
that it’s so joy-giving.

298
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:59,183
Every step you move forward,

299
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,253
it’s so joy-giving.

300
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:06,925
This sinking in that well

301
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,594
is so very joy-giving.

302
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:13,461
It’s not painful, you don’t have to crucify yourself,

303
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:18,195
you don’t have to carry the cross. He’s done it for you.

304
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,555
So what do you sacrifice?

305
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:26,277
Is your laziness!

306
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,672
When it comes to the satisfaction of ego,

307
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,906
people are overactive.

308
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:39,270
They are like bullets then.

309
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:43,498
And when it is the satisfaction of their physical comfort,

310
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,675
they become – I don’t know.

311
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:50,350
We had one rakshasa called Kumbhakarna,

312
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,760
who used to sleep for six months

313
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,967
and used to be awake six months.

314
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:03,122
But here I see people sleep for twelve months,

315
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:06,329
so what do you call them?

316
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:14,140
Then they say, “Mother, we can’t keep awake!” Why?

317
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:18,411
Because you are not meditating,

318
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:21,861
you are not one with Christ.

319
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:26,381
Then His agnya, He controls.

320
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:30,632
With that Agnya, you cannot sleep.

321
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:36,232
If His blessings are there on the Agnya, you cannot sleep.

322
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:39,359
You won’t believe with the slightest light,

323
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:42,376
artificial light specially, I can’t sleep;

324
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,516
because still Christ is awake

325
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,916
and I have to be awake.

326
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:56,646
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaj Yogis.

327
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,091
We have a special responsibility

328
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,942
as our connection with Christ is.

329
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:07,610
Our main responsibility is, all the time, intensely, to think,

330
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,259
“What we can do for the betterment of human beings?

331
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:18,087
And what are we doing about it?”

332
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,508
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

333
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:27,135
because that was the best way to make people understand

334
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:31,235
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

335
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,603
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

336
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,070
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

337
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,802
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

338
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,814
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

339
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,086
is absolutely absurd!

340
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,166
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

341
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,569
why should it create human beings?

342
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,496
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

343
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,502
You have to do it.

344
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:15,422
Unless and until you become deep,

345
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:19,688
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

346
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:24,510
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

347
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:34,221
Now if there is no instrument, electricity cannot work, can it?

348
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:38,137
Now you should say, “The electricity itself must come before me

349
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:41,876
and must do everything!”

350
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:49,512
You have to have the instrument and you are the instrument

351
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:55,852
and if you do not want to do it, how can Paramchaitanya do it?

352
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:58,515
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

353
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:03,393
that, “Let electricity do the job, we’ll not have any instrument.”

354
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,583
Can I work it out?

355
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:11,083
Can you work it out?

356
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:21,294
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

357
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:26,173
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

358
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:31,126
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

359
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:38,264
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

360
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:41,329
with the family,

361
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:45,896
all kinds of nonsensical things.

362
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,545
Now supposing this instrument, which is meant for my lecture,

363
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:57,856
forgets what it is

364
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,818
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

365
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,437
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

366
00:29:08,453 --> 00:29:12,602
then what’s the use of making this useless instrument?

367
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,937
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

368
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:22,015
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

369
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:30,983
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

370
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:40,995
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

371
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:45,340
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

372
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,528
like this that,

373
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:55,394
“We’ve done our job. Let the young people do it now!”

374
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:01,502
You are matured,

375
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:04,880
and the matured have to do the job.

376
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,338
“We have done our level best!”.  What have you done so far?

377
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:27,234
So much to be done still.

378
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,905
And somehow or other

379
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:33,844
we have to touch

380
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,634
that area where such people remain like the yesterday’s player.

381
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:42,216
He is not doing God’s work.

382
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:47,562
He’s an artist

383
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,239
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

384
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:02,342
He will get the same amount whether he’s perfect or not,

385
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:09,484
but he’s practising at home,

386
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:13,586
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

387
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:17,264
All the time working it out so that

388
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:21,346
his performance should be excellent.

389
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:24,639
So he’s seeking an excellence.

390
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:28,936
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

391
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,361
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

392
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:43,545
Only through excellence you will really become Sahaj Yogis.

393
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:50,568
Otherwise, you could be a headache

394
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:54,412
to me and to yourself.

395
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:01,715
You would be a headache to Sahaj Yogis.

396
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:05,870
A most non-progressive, destructive element

397
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,331
I would say a person is who is not alert.

398
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,086
You have to be aware,

399
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,110
aware of your responsibilities.

400
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:21,516
So far

401
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:26,713
I have been saying that still the preparation is on,

402
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:30,592
they have to correct themselves,

403
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,107
they have to clear out themselves,

404
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:43,435
they have to work it out, still their conditionings, this ego.

405
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,135
But now, twenty years have passed

406
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:53,099
and beware!

407
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:57,925
Be aware that twenty-first year

408
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:02,113
is going to be a very big jump.

409
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:06,349
I’m warning you again and again and again and again.

410
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:13,037
And you have to work very hard to develop yourself vertically

411
00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:18,825
in balance with your horizontal growth.

412
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:22,896
It’s not my lecture for entertainment or anything,

413
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,387
but should go to your heart, to your brain, to your being,

414
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:32,114
as this is very important.

415
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:37,027
And you are not going to waste it.

416
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,863
All the time you have to think that you are a Sahaj Yogi

417
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:45,965
and you have to know what you have to do in Sahaj Yoga

418
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,394
and how to achieve it.

419
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,726
You should not be satisfied

420
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:56,598
unless and until you have achieved that excellence.

421
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:02,049
That’s the very important, crucial point today

422
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,915
I wanted to tell you because today is

423
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:09,825
Easter Day which was a very crucial point

424
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,188
for the development or the growth of the Spirit,

425
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:17,571
because Sahasrara we could never have achieved

426
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:20,837
if Agnya was blocked.

427
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,967
Christ could have said,

428
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,670
“All right, let Paramchaitanya do it!

429
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,776
Let Paramchaitanya get itself hanged.

430
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:36,508
Why should I do it?”

431
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:44,843
He had to do it and He was the instrument and He’s done it.

432
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:52,257
So Sahaj Yoga is not only for exploiters.

433
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:59,075
If you try just to exploit Sahaj Yoga, you’ll be exploited too.

434
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,602
But is for the exploitation of joy.

435
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:08,434
But that’s only possible if you grow, you touch your depth.

436
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:13,319
If you are not deep enough, you’ll hang in the air, as I said.

437
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:17,832
And that has to be worked out, that has to be found out:

438
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:24,056
how best you can do it, how much you can reach people,

439
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,059
how many people you have given Realisation,

440
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:30,047
how many people you’re going to help improve their health,

441
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:33,947
their mental conditions and then

442
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:38,041
how much you are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

443
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:47,254
So that is going to work out what I call

444
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:53,082
the collective ascent

445
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,585
of human beings.

446
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,483
May God bless you!

447
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:21,911
To be in connection with Christ is to be

448
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:26,130
enjoying your meditation.

449
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:37,071
All right.

450
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:43,071
So, puja is another thing which, I know it, helps you a lot.

451
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:48,375
It gives you a definite push, I should say,

452
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,468
but you don’t retain it.

453
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:57,898
You don’t retain it. Then what’s the use?

454
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:02,656
So also you have to retain,

455
00:37:06,747 --> 00:37:10,112
should have power to retain.

456
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:13,891
That’s only possible if you have

457
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:19,172
touched your depths, which you have.

458
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:26,976
I am so happy to come back to you all.

459
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,570
I missed you all very much.

460
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:36,521
I’m travelling and working very hard.

461
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:44,215
I don’t know if I work hard. I don’t think about it, never.

462
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:51,199
So once you know that this is what you have to be,

463
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:54,953
then you don’t work, it just works.

464
00:37:57,427 --> 00:38:02,617
Then you don’t think you are working.

465
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:07,900
This is a subtle point you have to understand:

466
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:12,602
that everything works out

467
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:17,985
and you work in a way

468
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:24,920
and it works out, but you don’t work.

469
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:30,400
Like the Sun shines:

470
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:34,212
if you ask the Sun, “Poor Sun, you have to work so hard!”

471
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:39,085
He said, “When? When was that?”

472
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,937
So you say, “You have to rise in the morning, then you have to…”.

473
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:48,653
“No, no, no, no, no! I was just with myself, nothing else.

474
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:53,825
I was with myself, I was enjoying myself. When did I work?”

475
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:59,773
As long as you are with yourself

476
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:02,454
there is no question of you getting bored

477
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:05,698
or no question of you getting tired, nothing.

478
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:09,040
You are with yourself, finished!

479
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:14,376
But unless and until that happens within you

480
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:16,268
then these problems do come up,

481
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,870
and so please, please again I would say,

482
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:24,318
value your Self-realisation,

483
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:29,701
value your Realisation, value your life.

484
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,475
You all are very precious people

485
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:36,301
and you are the ones who are chosen.

486
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:43,303
I hope all of you come to Sahasrara day

487
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:49,404
after a very intensive meditative time.

488
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:59,288
Otherwise suddenly I’ll find people who are doing Sahasrara puja

489
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:02,928
with their all Sahasraras caught up.

490
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:09,361
May God bless you!

491
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:54,200
May God bless you.
