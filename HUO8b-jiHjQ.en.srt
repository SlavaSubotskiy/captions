1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,010
Shri Mataji, what is Sahaja Yoga?

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,260
Sahaja.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,040
Sahaja. Saha means ‘with’

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,886
Ja means ‘born’.

5
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:15,446
So it is born with you.’ The right’

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:20,882
to become ‘united,’ which is the yoga with the Divine.

7
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:25,367
And this Sahaja Yoga is something that everybody can have, is it?

8
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,837
Is it something, everybody can practice?

9
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:29,547
Of course.<br>

10
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:36,460
And how does this connection with the Divine take place?

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,645
We have within ourselves this power in the triangular bone

12
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:44,135
which is called a ‘Sacrum’ meaning sacred,

13
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:48,724
which when awakened sprouts like a plumule in a seed

14
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:52,814
and rises through six subtle centres,

15
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:56,963
opens out in the last centre

16
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:01,133
and gets connected with the Divine,

17
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:04,900
which is subtle energy, all around us,

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,370
which organises us,

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,460
which nourishes us, does all the living work.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,800
Above all it loves us.

21
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:19,259
Does this mean Shri Mataji, that people who have not

22
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:23,884
had the ability to practice Sahaja Yoga are not connected with the Divine?

23
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,993
Most of them are not.

24
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:29,825
And if some of them are, they don’t know all about it.

25
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,844
So this is what,

26
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:37,081
an extra force that is available to human beings to develop themselves in this world?

27
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:38,046
Of course

28
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:41,366
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution,

29
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,265
where you have to get connected with the Divine.

30
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,270
You have to feel it on your central nervous system

31
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:50,359
and that’s how you get Self-realization.

32
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,718
Do I perceive here that this is a way of balancing oneself?

33
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:03,464
Of keeping in such a way of living one’s life,

34
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:08,094
that one is not unbalanced in one’s view of what is going on around us?

35
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:12,702
Yes. We have two sides in our system of the autonomous nervous system,

36
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:13,988
left and right,

37
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:17,457
which we call as left and right sympathetic nervous system.

38
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:23,938
Left side caters for our emotions,

39
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,001
for our past, our desires.

40
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,468
The right side caters for our action,

41
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,727
physical and mental.

42
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:37,604
If you indulge in one too much and go too far with it,

43
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:41,582
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

44
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:46,966
In the centre lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

45
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:50,696
This is the channel which is the central path of ascent.

46
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,940
When the kundalini rises through it,

47
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,610
it brings you in the balance

48
00:02:55,648 --> 00:03:00,358
because it rises in the centre of the system.

49
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,947
So this is the minimum that happens, that you develop your balance.

50
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:09,937
So how does one actually achieve this balance?

51
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,786
It just happens spontaneously.

52
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:17,815
In other words, there is no physical requirement on an individual?

53
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,515
Not at all. Not at all.

54
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,365
It’s an evolutionary step. As I told you

55
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:28,295
in our evolution, we have developed a balance, we can stand on our two legs.

56
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,955
Animals cannot.

57
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:38,001
In the same way, you develop this special balance between your emotions and your actions

58
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,171
in a very proper way.

59
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,461
You speak as though this is some sort of evolutionary step.

60
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,531
Yes it is.

61
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,694
It is the last breakthrough,

62
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:51,044
that you have to become the Spirit now

63
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:53,911
and this has to be achieved,

64
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,864
which can be achieved only through a living process

65
00:03:56,872 --> 00:04:00,631
because we have become human beings through a living process

66
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:04,452
and that living process has to act within us.

67
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:10,067
This sounds as though it is rather a significant time than in the history of humanity?

68
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:10,967
Very much.

69
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,485
In the history of humanity,

70
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,437
in the history of evolution,

71
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,620
in the history of spirituality,

72
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,670
it is the most important time

73
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,819
because here, where you will get whatever has been promised to you so far.

74
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,836
So it is no accident then that Sahaja Yoga has appeared in the world at this time?

75
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,036
No, not at all, not at all.

76
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,816
It is all predicted thousands of years back in India

77
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:37,681
and later on by many Saints.

78
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:41,121
Even William Blake has predicted it.

79
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:48,830
Shri Mataji you went to Russia last year and I believe the reception you got was most surprising?

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,540
Yes.

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,950
I was myself surprised

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,253
because thousands of people came

83
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,990
and very sensible well-educated people came

84
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,618
and they all settled down. Thousands.

85
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:08,598
I did not know how to cope with that number because there were so many,

86
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:15,197
and even the members of the supreme council, the government, they came.

87
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:23,545
but I could only say that in the so-called free societies

88
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:27,538
we waste too much time experimenting with our freedom

89
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:32,588
and indulge too much into politics which is a waste thing, I think,

90
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:35,389
then the economics, all these things.

91
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,729
While the people there did not have any such chances.

92
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,691
So they put their energies to something that was higher than that.

93
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,349
They diverted and they were very knowledgeable,

94
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,849
they knew a lot about seeking.

95
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:54,119
They knew a lot about Kundalini and as if they were just waiting for me.

96
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,779
It was very remarkable.

97
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,990
Mr Gorbachev has said the Russians require a mental revolution.

98
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,139
Do you see the acceptance of Sahaja yoga as part of this revolution?

99
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,046
Of course. He himself is a saint

100
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,946
and what he is meaning by ‘mental’, that

101
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:17,176
they should now understand that they have to develop that balance

102
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,691
between communism and democracy.

103
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,011
Our democracies are imbalanced.

104
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,361
They are one-sided.

105
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,458
They have no.. not the other side of collectivity

106
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,868
but communism has collectivity.

107
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,906
It is power-oriented.

108
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:37,890
Our democracies are money-oriented.

109
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:43,062
What he is meaning is the maturity of our wisdom

110
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:47,091
So referring back to what we were talking about earlier,

111
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:49,115
is it...?

112
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:58,543
As we were talking about earlier, about bringing the human body into balance? 

113
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:04,547
Could we say then that Mr Gorbachev is bringing the whole eastern Bloc into balance?

114
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,317
Yes.

115
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:15,317
Yes, they had gone too much on one side and he is trying to bring them in the centre.

116
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:23,790
You mentioned that you went to an eastern bloc conference last year

117
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:29,690
and I believe you gave many influential people, Realisation?

118
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,300
Is it true that you believe that this was instrumental in helping the overthrow of oppressive communism?

119
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,410
It was a yoga, yoga seminar

120
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,687
and I expected all of them to be there

121
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,082
and surprisingly I talked to them hardly for 30 to 35 minutes

122
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:49,582
and then I gave them realisation and all of them got it.

123
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:54,122
They were representatives from all these Eastern Bloc Countries.

124
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,376
When they got it they were so surprised at it,

125
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:00,646
then they walked out with me out of the hall

126
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,946
and nobody was left in the hall to listen to other people.

127
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:08,483
They gave me their addresses and they said we want ‘this only’, in our country 

128
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:13,155
and they wanted to start centres and I am told they have already started centres.

129
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:21,247
The all-pervading power requires a medium, to trigger something

130
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:24,850
and when these people were created as Realised souls,

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,800
as they got connected with this ‘ all-pervading power’,

132
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,220
I think they had triggered it.

133
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:33,070
They had that confidence within them,

134
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,400
that courage in them

135
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,568
because once we are realised, you become very courageous

136
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:42,334
 and you want to establish truth at any cost.

137
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:46,954
Shri Mataji the West, shall we call it the Western Nations

138
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:52,494
have had Sahaja Yoga available to them to investigate

139
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:57,771
to see for themselves how it worked for 20 years

140
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,942
and yet it has been very slow to grow.

141
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,784
Why has it happened this way, do you think?

142
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:09,998
Here people have so many diverse ideas about things.

143
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:15,458
They're very self-opinionated also about things

144
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,410
and the so called man made religions all over

145
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,990
have also conditioned them too much.

146
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,650
They've other conditioning of different norms that they have

147
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,125
as far as the social life is concerned

148
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:37,314
and the physical appearances rather on a very superficial level.

149
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,499
So the people have not grown, I think so, much deeper.

150
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,109
Of course, I must say there are so many seekers in the west,

151
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,166
So many seekers

152
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:55,768
and they were lost because as soon as people knew that there’s a market for them,

153
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,967
the false gurus jumped out

154
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:01,154
and they started preaching about false things

155
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,067
just to earn money.

156
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,234
They were all money-oriented people,

157
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:08,584
Now there’s another psychology with the western mind

158
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,188
that you must buy everything.

159
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:14,718
If something is not for sale, then it is useless

160
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:20,357
and this psychology has really deterred them to come to Sahaja Yoga very much

161
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,527
because this is a living process and you cannot pay for it

162
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,968
and they could not bear it.

163
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,514
I mean, actually, I must say,

164
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:31,974
one of the very important television gentlemen told me off

165
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:37,591
that Anglo Saxon brain cannot accept anything which cannot be sold.

166
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,301
I did not know what to tell him.

167
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,988
I just said,’ Who has made this brain?

168
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,368
This God has made. Then why is it so?’

169
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,500
So You have an expectation really that this thing called Sahaja Yoga will change the world?

170
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,923
Of course.

171
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,660
It changes human beings and they manifest a change outside.

172
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,306
And we create a new race.

173
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,220
That is what they are talking about.

174
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,420
If you want they talk of a new age, of a new race

175
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,245
but I don’t know what is their imagination about it.

176
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,125
They talk about all this thing, ‘Aquarius.’

177
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,765
And Aquarius is the kundalini.

178
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:17,095
She is placed in the Aquarius, and they talk about the Aquarius age.

179
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:20,894
All kinds of things they are talking, writing, thinking about it,

180
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,444
but when it comes to actualisation.

181
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:27,454
I think they think I am very too simple for them.

182
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,344
Not complicated.

183
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,921
And Sahaja yoga is too simple.

184
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,391
It should be very complicated.

185
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:38,661
And all their own ideas about seeking, that they must suffer,

186
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,351
they must go to the Himalayas,

187
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,531
they must starve themselves

188
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,003
and then only they can get realisation

189
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:53,693
Shri Mataji, is the evolution of the planet closely related to the evolution of humanity?

190
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:57,401
Of course. It is very much related,

191
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:01,882
and the planet, our planet is moving in a spiral way.

192
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:05,122
All the planets are moving in a spiral way

193
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:10,800
and they are creating all possible things for the use of human beings

194
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,968
so that they can save time.

195
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:19,559
Save time for getting their ascent and for meditative growth,

196
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:23,458
but people don’t understand that part.

197
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,528
There are theories around now,

198
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:30,677
the suggestion so we say, that the planet could be a living organism,

199
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,518
a complete entity?

200
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,278
Of course it is.

201
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:37,198
One of the examples of this one, I can give you,

202
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:44,316
is that if you sleep under a coconut tree,

203
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:47,754
a coconut never falls on anything that is living,

204
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,420
whether it is a human being or a snake.

205
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,764
Never falls.

206
00:12:54,514 --> 00:13:00,489
That is so? Is it all around the world, coconuts never fall on living creatures?

207
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,989
So they understand.

208
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:10,497
We call it as Shri Pala because we think that it is like a brain which understands.

209
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:14,650
Well, if this world is a living organism,

210
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,960
what is the brain? What drives this being,

211
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:21,630
this organism? What has made it evolve the way it has?

212
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:27,265
There is this subtle power which is all-pervading of God’s love

213
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:32,705
which manifests all the things like living work,

214
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:36,161
all nourishment, all balancing.

215
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:42,481
It’s so balanced if the Pacific was slightly deeper than this,

216
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,039
there would have been problems.

217
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:54,161
If Himalaya was say one and a half times than what it is,

218
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,308
there would have been problems.

219
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:59,512
So everything is so balanced in nature,

220
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:03,422
and the Almighty has created only one world.

221
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:06,352
Only we human beings have divided

222
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:10,152
and moved like criminals with our passports in our hands.

223
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,744
Shri Mataji, What we have been talking about,

224
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:19,004
many people would regard as a belief or a theory.

225
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:24,183
How does one know the difference between truth and a belief?

226
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:28,763
First of all anything for which you have to pay money is not the truth.

227
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,210
You can’t pay for the truth.

228
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:38,326
If you cancel out that, I think 99.9% of all the falsehood will drop out.

229
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,194
But truth to be really actualised

230
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,834
you have to have Self Realisation.

231
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,814
Then you feel on your fingertips vibratory awareness.

232
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,729
A new awareness, a new dimension awareness..

233
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:56,889
by which you can make out what is true and what is false.

234
00:14:56,874 --> 00:15:01,264
That's an absolute truth that you realise at that stage.

235
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:06,821
So one must have one’s realisation really to be able, to tell the truth?

236
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:11,128
Even to follow anyone, one must have Realisation.

237
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,881
Shri Mataji thank you very much.

238
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,272
Thank you.

239
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,962
Russians are doing wonderfully too.

240
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,632
Russians are doing wonderfully.

241
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:26,176
Shri Mother, I was reading an article just now

242
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,626
where you were talking about inner peace and outer peace?

243
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:36,476
This seems to be something that attracts the attention of people in a stressful age.

244
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:39,860
By realisation

245
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,479
what happens, as a result

246
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,314
you become a person

247
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:50,864
endowed with thoughtless awareness.

248
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:54,365
That means you see everything.

249
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,674
You witness everything

250
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,195
and whenever you want to

251
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,544
say or to think you can see about it

252
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:08,289
but you don’t react. There is no reaction.

253
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,111
So you are

254
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:21,752
empowered to see it in such a manner

255
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:25,674
that there need not be any thought,

256
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:30,064
just the whole creation acts on you.

257
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,644
It’s a very subtle thing.

258
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,634
It is to be experienced

259
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:41,264
and that is the point where we realize that we are the source of peace,

260
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:44,951
and that is how our inner peace is established.

261
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,172
Now people have many foundations of peace,

262
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:50,750
I have known all of them. They have no peace within themselves.

263
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,618
Some people have got peace awards

264
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,618
and they're horribly hot-tempered people,

265
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,088
but they have got peace awards, Noble prizes.

266
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:06,943
The peace has to be first of all found inside and then it manifests outside.

267
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:13,264
Shri Mataji, another question we wanted to ask you

268
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,249
is because of this rather useful way,

269
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,950
You use your hands to describe the movements of the chakras when they part

270
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,546
I wonder if you could just explain why,

271
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:32,266
when illness occurs it occurs because of the movement away of one centre from another?

272
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,346
All right.

273
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:37,636
What I try to show them is that this is the left side, this is the right side.

274
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,123
This is the left sympathetic nervous system say

275
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,753
and this is the right sympathetic nervous system

276
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,853
and really the spinal cord looks like this,

277
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:48,253
and inside here is the spinal cord

278
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,671
which has the centres in it.

279
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,791
The subtle centres.

280
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:56,971
Now when you start using the energy of these centres,

281
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,861
say too much on the right

282
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,462
and it starts moving more towards the right

283
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,552
and there is a constriction

284
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:09,462
and the power becomes less because you are exhausted,

285
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,433
going more towards the right side.

286
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:15,775
Suddenly something happens and from the left, if there is a jerk,

287
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,355
then the connection is completely broken.

288
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:23,044
This is on its own. It starts working on its own.

289
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:27,184
That is what you say that this has become malignant.

290
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:31,929
It has no relationship with the whole to have proportionate growth 

291
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:35,804
So if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes

292
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,905
and cover your mouth. Everything!

293
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:41,359
This is how a cancer is set in or any other disease.

294
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,724
So many psychosomatic diseases

295
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:47,884
are nothing but somatic is from the right side

296
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,834
and when the psyche gives in,

297
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,564
then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

298
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,524
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic

299
00:18:56,554 --> 00:19:01,374
than physical and these we call them as incurable,

300
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:05,345
can be easily cured by kundalini awakening

301
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,985
because when kundalini passes through this,

302
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,679
she just integrates them.

303
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,919
For example, she’s going like this

304
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:16,069
then she goes into this integrates them.

305
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,089
Just like she strings them like pearls

306
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:25,230
and so they have brought around and also she nourishes that centre.

307
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,495
That's how people get cured,

308
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:30,710
automatically by themselves, by their own power.

309
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:41,001
Shri Mataji do you want to speak to the ABC in Adelaide this afternoon 

310
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:45,368
or would you rather that I rang them and said you're too busy?

311
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:58,127
Yes, abrupt also a very flippant type of thing that is not going to help

312
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:01,237
They said they wanted to talk to you about false gurus and more.

313
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,543
They have been having little trouble this morning.

314
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:15,245
You know we have banners to put up announcing your program tonight

315
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:19,568
and we had them on various bridges and they kept chasing them away

316
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,720
we finally found a place where they've allowed them to stay?

317
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,896
They must be busy with the election. They want to reserve places for election

318
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:38,145
If it was for the election then they would be able to go anywhere. 

319
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:42,145
If it's anything else they are not so happy.

320
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:45,445
That shows their attention.
