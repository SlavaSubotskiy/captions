1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:13,080
Shri Mataji what is sahaja yoga?
Sahaja - 'Saha' means 'with', 'ja' means born so it is born with

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,840
you the right to become United which is
the yoga with the divine and this this

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
sahaja yoga is something that everybody
can have is it is something everybody

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,010
can practice of course and how does the
this connection with the divine take

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,800
place we have within ourselves this
power in the triangular bone which is

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,820
called a sacred meaning sacred which
when awakened sprouts like a primule in

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:58,129
a seed and rises through six subtle
centers opens out the last Center and

8
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:05,430
gets connected with the Divine which is a
subtle energy all around us which

9
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,920
organizes us which nourishes us does all
the living work above all it loves us

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,280
does this mean Shri Mataji that
people who have not had the ability to

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,189
practice Sahaj yoga are not connected
with the divine most of them are not and

12
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,150
if some of them are they don't know all
about it

13
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,299
so this is what a an extra force that is
available to human beings to develop

14
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,650
themselves in this world of course this is
the last breakthrough of our evolution

15
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,600
where you have to get connected with the
divine you have to feel it on your

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,159
central nervous system and that's how
you get your self-realization. Do I

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,960
perceive here that this is a way of
balancing oneself of keeping in such a

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,570
way of living one's life in such a way
that one is not unbalanced in one's view

19
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,520
of what is going on around us yes we
have two sites in our system of

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,560
autonomous nervous system
left and right which recall is left and

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:24,200
right sympathetic nervous system
left-side caters for our emotions for

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,150
our past our desires the right side
caters for our action physical and

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,480
mental if you indulge into one too much
and go too far with it you develop an

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,390
imbalance within yourself in the center
lies the third power which we call as

25
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,340
parasympathetic nervous system this is
the channel which is the central path of

26
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,879
ascent when the kundalini rises through
it it brings you in the balance because

27
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:02,030
it rises in the center of the system so
this is the minimum that happens that

28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,920
you developed your balance so how does
one actually achieve this balance it

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,790
just happens spontaneously in other words
there's no there's no physical

30
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,639
requirement on an individual not at all
not at all it's a evolutionary step as I

31
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,349
told you in our evolution we have
developed a balance we can stand on our

32
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,169
two legs animals cannot in the same way
you develop this special balance between

33
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:42,709
your emotions and your actions in a very
proper way you speak as though this is

34
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,040
some sort of evolutionary step yes it is
it is the last breakthrough that you

35
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,769
have to become the spirit now and this
has to be achieved which can be achieved

36
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,030
only through a living process because we
have become human beings through a

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,209
living process and that living process
has to act within us this sounds as

38
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,349
though it is rather a significant time
than in the in the history of humanity

39
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:15,349
very much in the history of humanity in
the history of evolution in the history

40
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,870
of spirituality is the most important
time because here where you will get

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,740
whatever has been promised to you so far
so it's no accident

42
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,990
sahaja yoga has appeared in the world at
this time no not at all not at all it's

43
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,669
all predicted thousands of years back in
India and later on by many Saints even

44
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:44,870
William Blake has predicted it Shri
Mataji you went to Russia last year and

45
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:53,750
I believe the reception you got was most
surprising yes I was myself surprised

46
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,830
because thousands of people came and
very sensible well-educated people came

47
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,840
and they all settle down thousands I
didn't know how to cope with that number

48
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,470
because there were so many and even the
members of the Supreme Council the

49
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:21,320
government they came in that I could
only say that in the so-called free

50
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,300
societies we waste too much time
experimenting with our freedom and

51
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,349
indulge too much into the politics which
is a waste thing I think the economics

52
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:39,410
all these things while the people there
didn't have any such chances so they put

53
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,229
their energies to something that was
higher than that they diverted and they

54
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,090
were very knowledgeable they knew a lot
about seeking they knew a lot about

55
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:56,410
Kundalini and as if they were just
waiting for me it was very remarkable

56
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,479
mr. Gorbachev has said the Russians
require a mental revolution do you see

57
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,419
the acceptance of sahaja yoga as part of
this revolution of course he himself is

58
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:14,419
a saint and what he is meaning by mental
then they should now understand that

59
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:20,840
they have to develop that balance
between communism and democracy our

60
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,460
democracies are imbalanced they are
one-sided they have no not the other

61
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,770
side of collectivity but communism has
collectivity it is power oriented our

62
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:40,590
democracies are money-oriented what he
is meaning is the maturity

63
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:49,580
of our wisdom so yeah referring back to
what we were talking about earlier is it

64
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:57,930
okay as we were talking about earlier
about bringing the human body into

65
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,850
balance could could we say then that mr.
Gorbachev is bringing the whole Eastern

66
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:13,020
Bloc into balance yes yes they had one
too much on one side and he's trying to

67
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,900
bring them in the center you mentioned
that you went to an Eastern Bloc

68
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,000
conference last year and I believe you
gave many influential people realization

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,210
is it true that you believe that this
was instrumental in helping the

70
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,840
overthrow of oppressive communism it was
a yoga yoga seminar and I expected all

71
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,539
of them to be there and surprisingly I
talked to them hardly for 30 to 35

72
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,830
minutes and then I gave them realization
and all of them got it they were

73
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,050
representative from all these Eastern
Bloc countries when they got it

74
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,630
they're so surprised at it then they
walked out with me out for the hall and

75
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,800
nobody was left in the hall listen to
other people they gave me their

76
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,780
addresses and they said we want this
only in our country and they wanted to

77
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,050
start our centers and I'm told they
have already started centers the

78
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,990
all-pervading power requires a medium to
trigger something and when these people

79
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,750
were created as realized Souls as they
got connected with this all-pervading

80
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,510
power
I think they'd record it they had that

81
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,320
confidence within them that courage in them because
once we realized you become very

82
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,740
courageous and you want to establish
truth at any cost

83
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,130
Shri Mataji the West shall we call it
the Western nations have had sahaja yoga

84
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,610
available to them to to investigate to
to see for themselves how it worked for

85
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:02,120
20 years and yet it has been very slow
to grow why is it happened this way do

86
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:12,100
you think here people have so many
diverse ideas about things they are very

87
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,140
self-opinionated also about things and
the so called man-made religions all

88
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,270
over have also conditioned them too much
they have other conditionings of

89
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:31,540
different norms that they have as far as
the social life is concerned and the

90
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,089
physical appearances rather on a very
superficial level so the people have not

91
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:43,070
grown I think so much deeper of course I
must say there are so many seekers in

92
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:52,970
the West so many seekers and they were
lost because as soon as people knew that

93
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,820
there's a market for them the false
gurus jumped out and they started

94
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,600
preaching about false things just to
earn money they were all money oriented people

95
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,060
now there's another psychology with the
Western mind that you must buy

96
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,800
everything if something is not for sale
then it is useless and this psychology

97
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,230
has really deterred them to come to sahaja
yoga very much because this is a living

98
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,760
process and you cannot pay for it and
they couldn't bear it I mean actually I

99
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,910
must say one of the very important
television gentlemen told me of that

100
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:40,640
anglo-saxon brain cannot accept anything
which cannot be sold I did not know what to

101
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,510
tell him I just said who has made this
brain his God has made then why is it so

102
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,970
so you have an expectation really that
the thing called sahaja yoga will change the

103
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,240
world
of course it changes human beings and

104
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,100
they manifest a change outside and we
create a new race that's what they're

105
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,900
talking about if you want they talk of
new age of a new race but I don't know

106
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,110
what is there
imagination about it they talk about all this

107
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,300
thing Aquarius and Aquarius is the
Kundalini she is placed in the Aquarius

108
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,339
and they talk about Aquarius age all
kinds of things they're talking writing

109
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,519
thinking about it but when it comes to
actualization I think they think I am

110
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,149
very too simple for them not complicated
and sahaja Yoga is too simple it should

111
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,699
be very complicated and all their own
ideas about seeking that this must

112
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:43,009
suffer they must go to Himalayas
they must starve themselves and then

113
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:51,110
only they can get realization Shri Mataji
is the evolution of the planet closely

114
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,480
related to the evolution of humanity, of course it is

115
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,240
very much related and the planet our
planet is moving in a spiral way all the

116
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,050
planets are moving in a spiral way and
they are creating all possible things

117
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:15,889
for the use of human beings so that they
can save time save time forgetting their

118
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:23,360
ascent and for meditative growth but
people don't understand that part there

119
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,399
are theories around now that the
suggestions so we say that the planet

120
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,790
could be a living organism a complete
entity of course it is one of the

121
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:43,839
examples of this one I can give you is
that if you sleep under a coconut tree a

122
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,549
coconut never falls on anything that is
living whether it is a human being or a

123
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:58,670
snake never falls that is so is it all
around the world coconuts never fallen

124
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:05,600
and living creatures so they understand
we call it as Shri Pala because because

125
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,309
we think that it is like a brain which
understands well if this world is a

126
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:18,319
living organism what is the brain what
drives this being this organism what has

127
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:23,550
made it evolve the way it has
there is this subtle power which is

128
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:31,410
all-pervading of God's love which
manifests all the things like living

129
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:40,710
work all nourishment all balancing it's
so balanced in the Pacific was slightly

130
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:52,410
deeper than this there would have been
problems if Himalaya was say one and a

131
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,510
half times then what it is there would
have been problems so everything is so

132
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:04,350
balanced in nature hmm and the Almighty
has created only one word only we human

133
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,790
beings have divided and moved like
criminals with our passports in our

134
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,100
hands
Shri Mataji what we have been talking

135
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,670
about many people would regard as a
belief or a theory how does one know the

136
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,220
difference between truth and a belief
first of all anything for which you have

137
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,710
to pay money is not the truth you can't
pay for the truth if you cancel out that I

138
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:41,610
think 99.9% all the falsehood will drop
out but truth to be really actualized

139
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:49,170
you have to have self realization then
you feel on your fingertips vibrational

140
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,400
awareness a new awareness a new
dimension awareness by which you can

141
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,790
make out what is true and what is false
that's an absolute truth that you

142
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,180
realize at that stage so one must have
one's realization really to be able to

143
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,330
tell the truth even want to follow anyone
one must have realization Shri Mataji

144
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,820
thank you very much thank you

145
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,840
I was really an article just now where
you were talking about inner peace and

146
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,520
outer peace this seems to be something
that attracts the attention of

147
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:45,040
people in this present stressful age by
realization what happens all to become a

148
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,050
person endowed with thoughtless
awareness that means you see everything

149
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:02,110
you witness everything and whenever you
want to say or to think you can see

150
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:18,580
about it but you don't react there's no
reaction so you are empowered to see it

151
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:27,720
in such a manner that there need not be
any thought just the whole creation

152
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:36,580
acts on you it's a very subtle thing is to
be experienced and that is the point

153
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,970
where we realize that we are the source
of peace and that's how our inner peace

154
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,770
is established now people have many
foundations of peace I have known all of

155
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,560
them they have no peace within
themselves some people have got peace

156
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,060
Awards there are horribly hot-tempered
people but they have got peace awards

157
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:05,350
Nobel Prizes the peace has to be first
of all found inside and then it

158
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:14,050
manifests outside Shri Mataji the another
question we wanted to ask you is because

159
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:20,920
of this rather useful way you use your
hands to describe the movement of the

160
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,170
chakra when they when they they part I
wonder if you could just explain why

161
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,300
when illness occurs it occurs because of
the movement away of one Center from

162
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,310
another all right what I try to show
them that this is the left side this is

163
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,480
the right side this is the left
sympathetic nervous system say and this

164
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,920
is the right sympathetic nervous system
and really spinal cord looks like this

165
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,330
and inside here
is the spinal cord which has the centers

166
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:56,690
in it the subtle centers now when you
start using the energy of these centers

167
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,500
say too much on the right and it starts
moving more towards the right and

168
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,950
there's a constriction and the power
becomes less because you are exhausting

169
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,880
going more towards the right side
suddenly something happens and from the

170
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,760
left if there's a jerk then the
connection is completely broken this is

171
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,340
on its own it starts working on its own
that's what you say that this has become

172
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,980
malignant it has no relationship with
the whole to have the proportionate

173
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,410
growth so if the nose starts developing
it can cover your eyes and govern your

174
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,960
mouth everything this is how a cancer is
setting or any other disease so many

175
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,510
psychosomatic diseases are nothing but
somatic is from the right side and

176
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,150
when the psyche gives in then it becomes
a psychosomatic disease there are so

177
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,360
many diseases which are more
psychosomatic than physical and these we

178
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,510
call them as incurable can be easily
cured by Kundalini awakening because

179
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,640
when Kundalini passes through this she
just integrates them for example she's

180
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,330
going like this then she goes into this
integrates them just like she strings

181
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,180
them like pearls
and so they have brought around and also

182
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,340
she nourishes that Center that's how
people get cured automatically by

183
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:37,520
themselves by their own power Shri Mataji do you

184
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,310
want to speak to the ABC in Adelaide
this afternoon or would you rather that I rang

185
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,720
them and said you're too busy

186
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:56,330
abrupt yes I've been a lot of problems
there abrupt and also very flippant type

187
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,259
anything that's not I said they wanted
to talk to you about false gurus and

188
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:07,869
more okay
few seconds what just do what all right
