1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,500
who was just a fisherman.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,166
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

3
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:09,333
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:16,583
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:23,667
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

6
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:28,709
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

7
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,917
who can only worship God.

8
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:38,083
So to put another extreme

9
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,291
to what Rama has created,

10
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,208
to bring people into the centre,

11
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:49,250
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

12
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,667
and rigidity of ritualism

13
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:57,750
and too much of fundamentalism.

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,750
So to put an end to that

15
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:02,792
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

16
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:08,834
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:13,583
So he started a new theme of,

18
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:20,000
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

19
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,625
that such a new theme should come up.

20
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:27,834
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,792
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

23
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:41,458
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

24
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,166
So the whole thing is a Leela.

25
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:48,792
And on this theme he worked out everything

26
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,125
to establish that it is a play.

27
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,792
And that is what you see in America,

28
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,125
very common that for people it has become a joke,

29
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,917
life has become a joke.

30
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,875
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

31
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,125
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

32
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:15,250
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,999
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

34
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,208
But it is a myth with Americans now

35
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,250
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,291
you have to have realisation.

37
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,333
Like if you are standing in the water,

38
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:39,542
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,458
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

40
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,583
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

41
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,875
by asserting itself.

42
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,999
But if you're in the boat

43
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,125
then the water that is around is an illusion.

44
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,834
So it's the state at which you are.

45
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:05,500
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

46
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,083
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

47
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,166
It is a reality. So what they forgot this point,

48
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,417
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

49
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,542
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

50
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,291
thinking that it's an illusion

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,625
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

53
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,166
this thing should be so

54
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,750
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

55
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,166
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

56
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:44,166
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

57
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,583
And some people go to that limit to say

58
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,542
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

59
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,041
nothing like a evil force.

60
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,999
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:02,041
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

62
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:07,333
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

63
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,083
In that play he was to be destroyed.

64
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,166
So he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

65
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,792
what not to be destroyed.

66
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:24,417
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

67
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,250
So to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

68
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,625
Like even if you think everything is a play,

69
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:35,041
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

70
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,083
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

71
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,875
like in a drama you sit down

72
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,166
and you watch everything as a spectator,

73
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:48,333
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,834
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

75
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,208
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,875
You have a sense of discretion to know

77
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,625
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

78
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,417
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

79
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,417
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

80
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,834
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

81
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,125
you're involved in it. So it is not,

82
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,166
for you do not know the discretion

83
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,999
between the tragedy and the comedy.

84
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,250
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,999
if you do your job well, then it's a comedy,

86
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,041
otherwise it's a tragedy.

87
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,333
So there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

88
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,166
another of the one who is in it.

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,125
So one has to understand in that light,

90
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:46,291
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

91
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,542
he was meaning for him, not for others.

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,542
For him it is a play.

93
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,542
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

94
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,917
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

95
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,917
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

96
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:09,417
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

97
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:13,041
So to him it was a play, everything was a play

98
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,999
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

99
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:23,291
So the first thing if you are

100
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,792
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

101
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:30,291
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

102
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:35,375
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

103
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,959
You cannot say what is wisdom.

104
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,041
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

105
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,625
Wisdom is a temperament,

106
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,083
is a quality of a personality

107
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:54,458
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

108
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,709
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

109
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,709
who are not traditional.

110
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,834
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,125
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

112
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,375
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

113
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,083
so he did not need any tradition at all.

114
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,458
But for you, you have to understand from the people

115
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,834
who have tradition what is wisdom.

116
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,250
So we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

117
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,792
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

118
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,667
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,Â¨

119
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:41,542
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

120
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,583
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

121
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:48,208
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

122
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:52,291
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

123
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,709
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

124
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,458
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

125
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,083
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

126
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,542
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

127
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,875
So because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

128
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:12,667
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

129
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,834
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,959
instead of

131
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,291
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

132
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,083
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

133
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,999
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

134
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,208
spoiling the other chakra also.

135
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:37,125
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

136
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,999
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

137
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,166
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

138
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,959
That's the best way to escape it.

139
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,625
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

140
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,542
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

141
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,500
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

142
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,417
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

143
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,750
Now the another side

144
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,792
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

145
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,041
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

146
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:12,625
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

147
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,166
So, "What's wrong?"

148
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,583
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

149
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,542
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

150
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:29,166
So it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

151
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,542
for example they paint their hair.

152
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:35,166
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

153
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,333
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

154
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,041
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

155
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,250
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

156
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,999
They cannot even create a little ant,

157
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,917
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

158
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,667
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

159
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,333
So this is the right side thing

160
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:07,875
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

161
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,166
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

162
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,792
that eyes are the ones

163
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,834
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

164
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,625
the power of Shri Krishna.

165
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:28,125
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

166
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,083
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

167
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,999
if he has Krishna consciousness,

168
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,959
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

169
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,542
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

170
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,208
should be able to cure anyone.

171
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,083
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

172
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,125
if it has Krishna consciousness,

173
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,208
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

174
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,750
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

175
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:59,250
So on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

176
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,542
When you feel guilty,

177
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,792
they try to find out some method of expression.

178
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,792
So they say they go to some guru

179
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,583
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

180
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,250
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

181
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,166
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

182
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,417
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

183
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,959
you get completely caught-up.

184
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,333
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

185
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,000
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

186
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,792
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

187
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:36,166
who get anginas and also who get cancer

188
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,542
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

189
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,417
without the connection with the Divine.

190
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,291
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

191
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,291
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

192
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,834
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

193
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:56,208
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

194
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,917
without feeling the power of that mantra.

195
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,750
So in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

196
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,709
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

197
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,291
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

198
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,834
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

199
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,750
They think they're very responsible people

200
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,041
and do all irresponsible things.

201
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,792
So when you want to spoil that chakra,

202
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,999
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

203
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,625
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

204
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:34,750
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

205
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,542
When you start saying in the ego form that,

206
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,999
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

207
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,333
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

208
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,417
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

209
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,291
then the whole thing disappears

210
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,583
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

211
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,250
Islam is nothing but surrender.

212
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,291
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

213
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:10,250
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

214
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,291
So you play the melody of God.

215
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,792
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,333
Every time you go back to discretion.

217
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,999
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

218
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,250
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

219
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,083
Like somebody wants to drink.

220
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:33,625
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

221
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,583
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

222
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:42,667
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

223
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:48,083
So this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

224
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:54,125
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

225
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,375
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

226
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

227
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,458
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

228
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,583
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

229
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,500
And then whatever you do has a justification.

230
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,999
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

231
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,083
they actually robbed the other people of their land

232
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,667
and now very nicely settled down.

233
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,125
Now, when I say that,

234
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,875
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

235
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:27,083
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

236
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,625
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

237
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,250
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

238
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,250
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,792
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

240
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,542
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

241
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,667
This is the way you face and not just to say,

243
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,125
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

244
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,625
But what are you doing about it?

245
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,417
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

246
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,125
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

247
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,458
I said, "What did you do there?

248
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,083
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

249
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,750
at least you did not go to fight there.

250
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,583
Why did you feel guilty about it."

251
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,959
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

252
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:21,083
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

253
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,750
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

254
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,333
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

255
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:33,458
that we suddenly become a personality

256
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,834
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

257
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,875
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

258
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,083
Alright, how?

259
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,291
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

260
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,208
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

261
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,999
Both are headaches to the whole world.

262
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,375
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

263
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,542
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

264
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:11,291
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

265
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,500
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

266
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,166
Children and father cannot live together.

267
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,125
Mother cannot live with the children.

268
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,417
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

269
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:28,709
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

270
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,834
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

271
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

272
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,583
There's no unison, there is no concord.

273
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:42,500
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

274
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,083
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

275
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:52,750
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

276
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,166
Even the destruction of evil is important,

277
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,583
even the killing of the evil is important.

278
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,250
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

279
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,875
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

280
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,166
and should have been put in charge of God?

281
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,625
He's saved by killing him.

282
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,625
Because he was destroyed,

283
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:19,750
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

284
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,500
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

285
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,999
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

286
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,500
evil is to be finished.

287
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:30,875
So what you have to pray

288
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,875
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

289
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,583
all the destruction of the world,

290
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,333
all the minds which build up our destruction,

291
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,166
please try to neutralise it."

292
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,709
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

293
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:48,709
Instead of that,

294
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:53,875
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

295
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,208
That's not correct . You have to stand up

296
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,375
and you have to say that it's wrong,

297
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,999
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

298
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,500
we have no right."

299
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:08,250
So when Krishna told Arjuna that "You kill everyone

300
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,000
who are related to you, who are your friends

301
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,291
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,667
It was Shri Krishna who said,

303
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:23,166
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

304
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,709
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

305
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:30,999
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

306
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,041
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

307
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,291
which started killing everyone,

308
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,542
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

309
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,500
You have no sense of right and wrong.

310
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,166
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

311
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,667
First of all try to save instead of killing.

312
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:55,375
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

313
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,917
people are getting drowned

314
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,250
and you find that you have to save the people.

315
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,333
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

316
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,458
There is no occasion for killing now.

317
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,709
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

318
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,375
What you have to do is to save people,

319
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,667
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

320
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:20,458
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

321
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,917
You just move them out. Take them away.

322
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,291
Have nothing to do with them.

323
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,667
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

324
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,542
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

325
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:36,375
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

326
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,291
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

327
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,875
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

328
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,208
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

329
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:51,667
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

330
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,208
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

331
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:55,125
you don't take up

332
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,000
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

333
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,166
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

334
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,500
I've seen people become very aggressive,

335
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,333
they talk very aggressively.

336
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:09,667
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

337
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,750
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

338
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,458
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

339
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,500
Very common.

340
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:25,125
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

341
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,999
Then you start aggressing each other also,

342
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,000
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

343
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,125
You're not to aggress.

344
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,083
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

345
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,417
What is discretion is diplomacy.

346
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,834
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

347
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,083
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

348
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,000
this man is dangerous,

349
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,625
he is troubling you,

350
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,500
now if you have a proper sense,

351
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:53,125
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

352
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,166
that there won't be any more discussion, or destruction.

353
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:03,000
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

354
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,999
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

355
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,542
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

356
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,917
So must have discretion, must understand.

357
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,083
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

358
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,166
where you find somebody is telling you,

359
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,083
"You see, this person has said this about you."

360
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,834
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

361
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,542
"That person has said this about you."

362
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,458
Then you start quarelling.

363
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:32,834
Instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

364
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:35,959
"Why, why this is happening,

365
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,625
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

366
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,417
We were friends, what has happened?"

367
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,542
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

368
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:50,083
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

369
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:55,083
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

370
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,375
delicate, beautiful.

371
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,250
Nobody should notice

372
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:07,542
that you have been in any way effective,

373
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,458
and that's how you'll work it out.

374
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,500
So the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

375
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,250
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

376
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,125
So he plays.

377
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,375
Give you an example how he plays.

378
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:28,959
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

379
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:34,417
who had a blessing from Shiva

380
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:40,750
that nobody can kill him.

381
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,542
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

382
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,291
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

383
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,208
So there was a saint who had a blessing

384
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,125
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

385
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,250
sleep in your yoga sleep,

386
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,333
and once you open your eyes

387
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:13,000
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

388
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,500
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

389
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,667
He was fighting this devil

390
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,542
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

391
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,583
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

392
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,750
So he started running away from the field,

393
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,999
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

394
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,750
the one who runs away from the battle field,

395
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,583
is regarded as something really derogatory,

396
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:44,417
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

397
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,542
So he didn't mind,

398
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,375
he ran away and then this devil started following him

399
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,709
And he went into the cave

400
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:55,041
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

401
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,667
And he removed his shawl

402
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,999
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

403
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,959
and hid himself.

404
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,208
So this rakshasa came behind him.

405
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:11,083
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

406
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,999
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

407
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,250
Come along now, open your eyes!"

408
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,458
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

409
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,500
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

410
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:29,750
and he just was burnt.

411
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,542
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

412
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:40,125
That is the sign of diplomacy.

413
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:45,542
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

414
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,333
the whole discretion, what he should do,

415
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,250
what is right, what is wrong,

416
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,041
is he doesn't have this problem.

417
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:59,166
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

418
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,917
So he played a trick .

419
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:06,875
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

420
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:13,083
And he made one king - you see-

421
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:21,333
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

422
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,041
But he could never touch them.

423
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,083
So Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

424
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,208
He has to have justification also,

425
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:32,000
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

426
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,917
So he killed this king, brought all these women

427
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:40,999
and they all became his wives, so-called.

428
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,667
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

429
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,375
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

430
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,834
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

431
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,000
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

432
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:58,291
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

433
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,999
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

434
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:06,333
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

435
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:10,667
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

436
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,999
meaning the power of creation,

437
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,291
because creation has been done already.

438
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,500
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

439
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,542
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

440
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,709
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

441
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:27,125
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

442
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,333
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

443
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,709
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

444
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,667
and she opens her left side.

445
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,750
And in front of her

446
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,999
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

447
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,875
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

448
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,333
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

449
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:51,792
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

450
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,917
But in this one, the one that they have here

451
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,041
is the child is kept underneath this,

452
00:26:57,291 --> 00:27:00,583
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

453
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:04,792
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

454
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,792
So I'll tell you the last story about her

455
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:14,417
which will conclude this talk about

456
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,375
Radha and Shri Krishna.

457
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,041
That one day,

458
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:25,500
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

459
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,458
and Narada said, "See,

460
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:30,166
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

461
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,667
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

462
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:37,500
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

463
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,417
So the rumour, you see, went into the women.

464
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:46,375
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

465
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,625
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

466
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,750
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

467
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,625
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

468
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:57,917
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

469
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,500
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

470
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:03,417
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

471
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,375
so don't listen to him."

472
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,709
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

473
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,500
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

474
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:11,667
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

475
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:15,208
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

476
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,999
They said, "What's the matter, what sort of a pain it is,

477
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,166
what can we do to overcome this pain."

478
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,125
He said, "There's very simple thing that

479
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:29,041
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

480
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,834
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

481
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,625
then I'll be saved."

482
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,250
So these ladies used their brains. They said that

483
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,999
"Already he doesn't love us

484
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,208
and then if we give him the dust of our feet

485
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:46,166
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

486
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,250
So what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

487
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,917
it's better to forget about it."

488
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,417
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

489
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:57,000
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

490
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,208
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

491
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:03,458
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

492
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,959
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

493
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,458
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

494
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,000
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

495
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,875
and this is the medicine." So he went to Radhaji

496
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,083
and he said to her that,

497
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,375
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

498
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:25,583
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

499
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,625
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

500
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,667
for that pain, of course, why not?"

501
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:38,083
So he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

502
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,291
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

503
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,625
She said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

504
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,625
he has no sense of sin at all.

505
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,917
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

506
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,458
what am I to worry about sins.

507
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,834
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

508
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,125
this is his worry."

509
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,959
So he took the dust of Radha's feet

510
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,458
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

511
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,500
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

512
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,875
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

513
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:07,375
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

514
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,458
He said, "That I know." So he said, "But how do you explain it?"

515
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,375
He said, "You'll understand just now."

516
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,959
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

517
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:20,166
you see Radha's feet were dusted

518
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,375
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

519
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:28,834
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

520
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,500
you see, the soil is yellowish

521
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:35,875
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

522
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,333
which she removed and took it.

523
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:43,583
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

524
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:47,625
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

525
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:52,583
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

526
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,875
on the lotus of his heart.

527
00:30:55,041 --> 00:31:01,041
The lotus had the pollen,

528
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,583
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

529
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,458
and was making it yellow.

530
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:09,166
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

531
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:15,375
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

532
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,000
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

533
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,208
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

534
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,792
They have to be Radha to understand him.

535
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,250
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

536
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,208
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

537
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:40,083
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

538
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43,500
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

539
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:46,917
So he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

540
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,709
give him the the power and everybody danced.

541
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:53,500
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

542
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:57,208
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

543
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:01,458
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

544
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,542
For a minute you abandon everything."

545
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,625
And that abandonment has now become a,

546
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,750
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

547
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:12,750
here it has become a year-long Holi.

548
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,834
So people are busy with a year-long Holi

549
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,709
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

550
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:20,166
So what will be the situation of such a place?

551
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,999
And that's why I think, what happens that

552
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:27,041
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

553
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:30,291
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

554
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:33,542
And once they get into you, you get funny,

555
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,250
you don't know why you behave like this,

556
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,834
why things work out that way.

557
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,999
This is why we have to understand

558
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,834
that we have to be attractive to God.

559
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:47,375
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

560
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,375
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

561
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,542
So May God Bless You.
