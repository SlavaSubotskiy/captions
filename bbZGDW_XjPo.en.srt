1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,060
Today is a great day

2
00:00:51,060 --> 00:01:02,700
when we are celebrating Mahalakshmi’s Puja.

3
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:17,000
You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, mother of Christ, who was Mahalakshmi.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:40,320
Mahalakshmi’s incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
First She establishes our dharma

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
by which we become righteous,

7
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,960
we become religious in the real sense.

8
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,300
After the light of Realisation we cannot do anything that is not dharma.

9
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,840
As you know what is dharma is,

10
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,080
and the maryadas, the boundaries of our behavior.

11
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,280
This transformation takes place automatically.

12
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,920
I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this, don’t do this,” like ten commandments.

13
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,160
You, yourself, establish your dharma

14
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,000
and you enjoy your virtues.

15
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,880
This happens, as you know – already has happened to all of you

16
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,780
with the grace of Mahalakshmi.

17
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,920
Then She starts bestowing blessings on you

18
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,400
First the blessing is of physical well-being

19
00:03:49,760 --> 00:04:02,300
by which your parasympathetic nervous system gets into proper shape

20
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,420
and a balance is established,

21
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,120
as if the Mahalakshmi principle holds the reins

22
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,100
and you cannot cross the limits,

23
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,460
you cannot go too much to the left or to the right.

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,580
By this principle you realise what is wrong with the outside religions,

25
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,240
you realise also that inside

26
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,940
all the religions are born

27
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,360
like flowers on the same of tree of spirituality.

28
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,080
And automatically you start worshipping

29
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,300
all the prophets

30
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,000
right from Abraham, Moses,

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,820
Confucius, Lao Tse, Mohammed Sahib, Nanak.

32
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,940
You worship them!

33
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,000
It is not that you have respect, but you worship,

34
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
and thus you lose the barriers of fundamentalism.

35
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
By the ascent, with this principle, you achieve a personality by which you become a universal being.

36
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,200
You understand the problems of your country

37
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and of your race, and you transcend

38
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,400
to see what’s wrong with them and how to correct them.

39
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,600
When the Mahalakshmi principle is awakened we realise

40
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,000
that outside we may be different but inside we are just the same.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All the masters and prophets are just the same,

42
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
whatever religion they might have been born.

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now this Mahalakshmi principle goes out of gear because of left or right side movement of our attention.

44
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Even people come to Sahaja Yoga and they start going either to the left or to the right.

45
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,940
One has to keep a proper watch,

46
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,000
because you have come to Sahaja Yoga to ascend.

47
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,700
Now, if you move to the right side then you start fighting with your leader,

48
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,820
finding faults with the leader,

49
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,000
and, as Christ has said, you become ‘murmuring souls’ – you start talking ill about your leader.

50
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,360
I have appointed Myself the leaders,

51
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,280
and I know what’s wrong with them or what’s not wrong with them.

52
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,480
They are in close contact with Me,

53
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,440
so you don’t have to judge them,

54
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,080
by that you are hampering the progress

55
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,020
of Sahaja Yoga and your own.

56
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,220
Then there are other people who try to find out new methods.

57
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,860
Such people are extremely difficult

58
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,140
because their ego, conditions them so much that they don’t see what’s wrong with them,

59
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,740
and they don’t know they are doing anti-God activities.

60
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,740
They are not creating problem for themselves but for others also.

61
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,740
Anybody who starts like this

62
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,820
suffers a lot,

63
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,180
there is no joy on their face,

64
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,220
they just try to show off

65
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,640
and it is very, very dangerous!

66
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:31,000
I have seen people who have tried all these tricks and fallen into lots of problems

67
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,800
because Sahaja Yoga has it’s own culture,

68
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,400
it has it’s own methods

69
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,660
which are absolutely approved by Me.

70
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,600
There is no need to start some new methods,

71
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,820
if so they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

72
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,520
This is the worst type of ego!

73
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,380
And one should not have anything to do with such people.

74
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,560
Already everything has been researched in Sahaja Yoga.

75
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,140
All the knowledge is already there,

76
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:40,960
but this comes from a kind of a ego which doesn’t feel the vibrations very well,

77
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,000
and then you try to push away from the Mahalakshmi principle.

78
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:08,100
The left side people, when they move, they fall into the trap of other type of gurus or other type of readings, even in Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:23,100
Sometimes people who’ll get too much attached to their wives, to their children, to their family, too much attached,

80
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,460
they become very left-sided.

81
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,440
They have no joy and they don’t want others to enjoy.

82
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,200
Such people also should go out of Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,000
Till they have overcome their attachments they should not be in Sahaja Yoga.

84
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:14,140
Mahalakshmi principle is extremely helpful, extremely nourishing and is the only way we can achieve our realisation and enlightenment

85
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,400
but one has to have proper balance.

86
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:44,980
In the beginning Mahalakshmi principle incarnated on this earth as the wife of Shri Rama – Shri Sita.

87
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,440
Then came the second incarnation at the time of Shri Krishna as Radha,

88
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,860
‘Ra’ is energy, ‘dha’ is the one which sustains.

89
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,480
And then came the incarnation of Mahalakshmi, is the Mother of Christ.

90
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The Christianity has failed because they did not recognise the powers of Mary.

91
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,020
This Paul was a hater of women

92
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,260
and showed no respect to women.

93
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,260
As a result of that, the women who are following so-called Christianity became very insecure.

94
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:17,380
Of course in Catholic Church, as you know, a woman is not, cannot become, a priest,

95
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:33,520
and also in the Protestant Church they don’t want to accept women as priests – big, big fight going on!

96
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,000
Even in the Orthodox Church they treat women as dirt.

97
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,380
As a result women in the West have become extremely insecure.

98
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:05,440
The way they accept to be nude, to expose their body, to sell their body, because they are so insecure, they have no identity.

99
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,440
If supposing in India a man tries to have relationship with another woman, the wife says“All right, you go to hell, I don’t care.

100
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,680
You are committing a sin, all right, go ahead, I have nothing to do with you,”

101
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,140
and the whole society will support that way,

102
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,940
but in the west the position of woman is really, really very, very low,

103
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
absolutely primitive.

104
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:05,700
They are mothers, they are sisters, they are grandmothers, they are daughters and wives.

105
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,720
I didn’t understand why the women in the west are so anxious to attract the men.

106
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,040
In India if any man looks at the woman she’ll go and slap his face.

107
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,600
This insecurity is so much that I have seen in films women becoming nude everywhere, they have all kinds of nude clubs and all that, but men never become, men never.

108
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:11,740
That I’ve seen films where women will become nude and show vulgarity, everything acceptably nonsense, while men were never take out their clothes.

109
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:30,040
As if the body of men is something special and the body of women is not to be respected.

110
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,700
It is a very primitive idea.

111
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:47,480
I can’t understand this, because it is the Adi Shakti who has created this Universe

112
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,560
not Sadashiva.

113
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:06,140
Even if women are not respected and they are not respectable, the Gods cannot reside in that country.

114
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,800
So, we have to understand that women should have their own dignity

115
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:36,240
and they should not yield to the pressures of men where they try to debase them.

116
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:54,100
But at the same time they must respect their husbands, their men-folk, and they have to be extremely loving and compassionate.

117
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Now, in the Western thinking they can’t understand a Immaculate Conception,

118
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,900
they don’t understand God.

119
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,000
It is God, and Divinity can do anything!

120
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:42,780
As you know Shri Ganesha was created by Parvati Herself, without Her husband,

121
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,760
and Indians do not doubt it.

122
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,540
After all He’s God

123
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,640
and She is Adi Shakti.

124
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,180
Now you see so many miracle photographs have come,

125
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,300
for you to see for yourself

126
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,200
that there are miracles created,

127
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,580
not in the photographs otherwise also you have seen so many miracles happening in Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:44,420
When I told that Ganesha is our Lord Jesus Christ, people would not believe it.

129
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:59,340
So I said symbolically, if you see from the right to the left, you will see Swastika

130
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
on the Mooladhara,

131
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,040
which is made of carbon atom.

132
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,000
And if you can make a photograph of a carbon atom,

133
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,500
and see it from right to the left, you do see the Swastika.

134
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,580
This is the fact,

135
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,180
is established

136
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,220
and if you see from the left to the right it is Omkara,

137
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:51,060
so thus what I’ve said is verified, scientifically.

138
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:03,380
But if you see from down below upward, then what do you see is the Alpha and Omega.

139
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,560
Now Christ has said, “I am the Alpha and I am the Omega.”

140
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,300
I do not know even at that time there was talk of alpha and omega

141
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,340
but now it is scientifically proved.

142
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:42,980
There are many other things about soul and everything – now we have scientifically proved it.

143
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,860
Also now they are working on genes

144
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,980
and they have found out that a person who is evil, who is wrong, who is not normal is because of a bad gene.

145
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,040
That is what is the bhoot.

146
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:24,440
So this how, you see, science is coming closer to Sahaja Yoga,

147
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,940
but scientists find it very difficult to accept Me.

148
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,780
They can’t understand that I could be the source of Divine power.

149
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:55,160
Till you have vibrations, how can you feel, how can you understand?

150
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,200
Despite that, now Sahaja Yoga is spreading in 55 countries,

151
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:21,400
but the most important thing is to keep your Mahalakshmi principle clean and open.

152
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:44,720
That is, a woman who is Mahalakshmi is a very good housewife, very good queen, Raja Lakshmi. There are ashta Lakshmis, there are eight forms of Lakshmi,

153
00:25:50,300 --> 00:26:00,800
and these eight forms of Lakshmi are to be expressed, manifested by a Sahaja Yogini.

154
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,560
And the men must respect

155
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,580
this Mahalakshmi principle within them.

156
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,940
First of all they have to be dharmic

157
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,720
and the basis of dharma is respect,

158
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,780
must develop respect and dedication.

159
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,940
If you cannot surrender and detach, you cannot enter into Mahalakshmi channel.

160
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,660
Either you will be money-oriented or power-oriented.

161
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:15,240
So, you have to be detached from money and power

162
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,780
then Mahalakshmi principle starts working and you become a seeker.

163
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,940
On every chakra Mahalakshmi gives you Her blessings,

164
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:53,040
but at the Sahasrara She gives you the collective-consciousness.

165
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:06,580
She makes you deft in Sahaja Yoga practice and also understanding.

166
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,280
I have seen, gradually, Sahaja Y ogis have become very subtle and I can talk to them on a very subtle level.

167
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:41,340
I am so happy, today, we are here to celebrate Mahalakshmi principle at the time of Mother Mary’s birthday.

168
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,960
She passed through the greatest ordeal to see Her son being crucified

169
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,100
but She knew what was the purpose of His crucifixion

170
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,080
and She accepted.

171
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:23,080
I can’t see a cross, if somebody is wearing a cross I said “Take out cross!”,

172
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,080
because the message of Christ is resurrection and not crucifixion.

173
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:55,260
But perhaps the Christians, especially Paul must have thought that he should use cross to make everybody feel guilty.

174
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,740
This Paul has really done so much harm that,

175
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:17,320
only after reading a treatise of ‘Nag Nagamani of Hammadi’,

176
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:28,600
I found out that Thomas had to run away to India to tell the truth.

177
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,660
With this Mahalakshmi principle our attention should be on our virtues,

178
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,260
and we must enjoy our generosity.

179
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,280
We must enjoy our purity.

180
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,560
We should enjoy our innocence and chastity – even men have to do that.

181
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,000
We should enjoy our detachments.

182
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,600
All this is already within your reach.

183
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:49,620
I’ve felt these people, when they were dancing, that they are all from Kashmir in, from,India

184
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,320
and Adi Shakti incarnated first in Kashmir.

185
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,080
I find Bulgarians very close to Indians.

186
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,220
And also Romanians.

187
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:28,220
Your talent in music I’ve seen, and that’s why you all can sing Indian music so easily.

188
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,960
I bless you, all Sahaja Yogis, that you develop a proper sense of balance

189
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:56,560
and that you spread Sahaja Yoga all over Bulgaria,

190
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,440
making everyone joyous and happy as you are.

191
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,900
We have to change the world.

192
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,800
It’s a tremendous task,

193
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:25,760
is the greatest event in the history of spirituality

194
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,780
and you are the participant of that,

195
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,460
so you have to understand that your purity is very important

196
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,160
and your surrendering

197
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,540
will definitely help you to ascend, faster and faster.

198
00:34:03,840 --> 00:49:24,620
So may God bless you!
