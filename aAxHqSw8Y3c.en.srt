1
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,709
I’m sorry for being late.

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:49,000
I did not know that this programme is in a beautiful place like this.

3
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:04,500
And here you see a beautiful painting of Michelangelo

4
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:16,417
expressing the desire of the Divine, your Father, to save you,

5
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:23,625
to help you out, and is working out.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:49,542
In Germany we have had very great aggressive happenings

7
00:01:51,291 --> 00:02:06,750
and that brought forth a devastating effect on the Western life, all over.

8
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,000
The value systems were broken,

9
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:17,000
the idea of dharma was disturbed,

10
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:22,417
women started behaving like men

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and so many people died.

12
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,417
Very young people died, very very young.

13
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,417
All their desires were not fulfilled,

14
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:52,625
all their life gave them nothing but war.

15
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,709
That was a kind of a heatwave that came,

16
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:06,500
destroying all the subtler things.

17
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:14,542
When the nature gets its respite, or is angry,

18
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:21,000
it destroys only gross things

19
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,834
but when human beings start destroying

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,291
they destroy even the subtler things like their value system,

21
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:41,917
your character, your chastity, your innocence, your forbearance.

22
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,834
So now the war is on on the subtler level.

23
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,375
We have to now understand

24
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:02,625
that all these things have brought such a shattering effect in the West,

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,750
on the Western personality.

26
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:18,750
So the first effort one has to do is to repair it,

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,458
to put it straight, make it stand on its own legs.

28
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:37,125
Because people lost their personality, their tradition,

29
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,542
they had no moorings, no roots

30
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:49,417
and they started moving towards anything

31
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:58,999
that was brought in as some sort of a intellectual experience.

32
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,500
The women became very independent

33
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:12,917
and they thought they can work out their own problems.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,709
That they thought they can become like men.

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here the problem started even in a worse way.

36
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,208
Because woman is a woman

37
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,083
and a very little thing which is, call it, a man in her

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,417
and when she tries to avoid what she has

39
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:49,000
and develop something that she has very little

40
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:54,500
then she becomes funny.

41
00:05:55,917 --> 00:06:00,000
But she may be possessed by so many men who are dead,

42
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:10,125
her desire to become manly can attract so many bhoots

43
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,000
who want to enter into a woman’s mind.

44
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:22,625
And when they enter they have the garb of a woman

45
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,125
and mind of a devil.

46
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,999
And the women can not see it

47
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,709
because maybe with those devilish things

48
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,083
in the wordly way they might be successful.

49
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:46,500
They might be better off. Maybe they can dominate everyone,

50
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,917
they might become meticulous like men, absolutely matter of fact,

51
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:04,500
very neat, tidy, clean, devoid of all beauty and sweetness.

52
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:20,709
Then these women ultimately become like vampires

53
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,333
so though the war is over

54
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:30,417
it is working through the women of Germany, I think.

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,709
I’d heard this attack had come before also

56
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,999
and there were women called as Amazonic.

57
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:52,208
Now that history is repeating itself again.

58
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,333
The other day I had an interview with a German lady

59
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,417
and I was amazed at her attitude

60
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:08,000
because I felt she’s still a Nazi in her, some Nazi bhoot is sitting in her.

61
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,917
She was a double personality, one way she was talking sweetly,

62
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,000
another way she was a Nazi

63
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and a fascist.

64
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:29,709
And very cunningly they have got arguments.

65
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,709
The first thing they can do is to say

66
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,125
that we are siding with downtrodden people, like India.

67
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,959
Indians are Aryans, we are Aryans

68
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,709
and we are people who are sympathising with Aryans.

69
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,417
Indians are spiritual people

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,625
and they feel they are like Indians of all the things, you know, can you believe it?

71
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,417
The quality of life should improve, is the point.

72
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,834
The quality of men is different from that of women,

73
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,083
I have told you many a times.

74
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:29,709
And if women try to be manly

75
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,750
then they cannot achieve anything proper.

76
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:36,000
We have had many like this.

77
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:40,000
You have seen Mao`s wife.

78
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,000
You have seen Mrs Chanka Sheik.

79
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,834
Now this new lady Carlos,

80
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,542
Carlos her name is? Marcos, Marcos.

81
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,834
So many women like this.

82
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,125
They always make a mess of things when they try to be manly.

83
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,999
In the history we have many women.

84
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:11,625
In India women are very well equipped.

85
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,125
we have had women like Jhansi ki Rani

86
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,291
who fought against the British. She was a widow.

87
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:24,750
She tied her child on her back and fought the British.

88
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,333
They say that her horse jumped from 180ft

89
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:37,000
from the turret of a fort

90
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,959
and the Britishers have written down that

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,417
‘Though we have got Jhansi the victory comes to us

92
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,709
but glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani’.

93
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,750
We have had great women in India.

94
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,959
Like Nur Jahan was another great woman,

95
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,000
we had Chand Bibi, Ahalyabai

96
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:00,000
but they were all women, they didn’t have ego of men.

97
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:08,834
When it comes to one can work, work in the offices with men

98
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,750
but they need not become men.

99
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,959
I’ll tell you an example of my own.

100
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,500
I had to build our house in Lucknow.

101
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:27,417
I did it in real woman style

102
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,999
and I built a very good house,

103
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,999
better than any man could build in a very very cheap way.

104
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:43,000
Like a man would go, first of all he’ll get an architect,

105
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,000
go and measure everything,

106
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,999
then he’ll try to fit everything into it beforehand.

107
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:55,333
Then he will in his ego go to some expensive place shop

108
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,000
get something expensive, be cheated by that.

109
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,208
Then again in his ego he’ll go and get some very expensive labour

110
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,417
and appoint somebody, he’ll be in charge of everything, in charge.

111
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,208
I did it in a very different way.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I had money, so went and found out

113
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:30,250
who have the best people, who have the best bricks.

114
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,000
The house was to be built by bricks.

115
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,959
Then what else do you need?

116
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,834
Just like a woman would cook her food, you see.

117
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,834
You need also sand, all right.

118
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:52,959
Then you need cement and you need iron bars, and labour.

119
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,000
So I didn’t go the way men went round.

120
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:06,999
I found out the man who was selling the best bricks.

121
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:13,542
So he said: “I have no money because I have to put up those kiln

122
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,250
and fill them up with the bricks

123
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,834
and for that you require initial money.

124
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,500
I said: “Alright, I’ll buy one whole kiln from you, whole one.

125
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,083
How much will you take from me?”

126
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,125
He said: “Five thousand rupees sufficient.”

127
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,625
But if he said, “If the kiln goes off,

128
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,333
or there’s something wrong with it, if it misfired,

129
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,625
then it is your lookout. I said: “Doesn’t matter.

130
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,625
You put one kiln in my name.”

131
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,999
So I bought a complete kiln from him, complete.

132
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:54,291
kiln is a thing where they put all the bricks, you see,

133
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,291
and then cover it with mud and fire it from down.

134
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,834
Sometimes it could be that the whole thing can go into a waste

135
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,834
or crumple down

136
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,583
I said: "You do like that. Only 5.000."

137
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,083
When it is nicely fired and all that

138
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,208
it would cost you nothing short of 50,000 rupees.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,041
Then I went to the river and I said:

140
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:31,000
“How much for a one part?” – as they call it, a big area of sand.

141
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,542
They said: “At this time, when it is summertime, it is very little,

142
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,999
but in wintertime it will be quite a lot.”

143
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,917
A man would go, he’d say “Alright, now you need so much, bring it now.

144
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,417
Then you will need more, you bring it now.”

145
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,291
But I didn’t do that, I said “Summertime is a nice thing,

146
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,625
cheap you are getting, why not buy the whole?”

147
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,999
So I bought the whole part, the whole area of that sand.

148
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,542
All right. Then I went for the ironmongers.

149
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,709
I said: "Now what about iron?"

150
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,417
They said: “You have to order

151
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:15,999
but if you order in bulk then we’ll give you much cheaper.

152
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
And cash down you have to pay so much.” I said “Alright.”

153
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:24,125
I ordered it. So it was all ready, just like we do for cooking,

154
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,000
you get everything ready made, ready there.

155
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,542
Then what we needed was wood.

156
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,500
So they said “Wood will come from Nepal.”

157
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,500
I said “Alright. What else?”

158
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,834
They said: “From any other forest it can come.”

159
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:45,750
So I went to a forest in the centre of India called Jabalpur

160
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:48,834
and there I ordered.

161
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,417
The whole wood was cut, newly cut.

162
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:57,291
and in an auction I bought a lot of wood from there.

163
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:03,000
And I got all that there, plus I got the marble from there.

164
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,500
This marble was never used before, anywhere.

165
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,333
I said: “It’s very simple, I can use this marble for everything.”

166
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:17,834
So I got marble and wood together from that place.

167
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:24,625
Then the labour. Then I asked my friends

168
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:30,750
if they knew any good workers who are good at masonary work.

169
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,500
They said: “Yes, this one is good, that one is good”

170
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,625
so I call all of them. I said, “See now you can stay with me in this house

171
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:40,000
and I’ll feed you very well and I’ll give you food

172
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,417
and I’ll look after you very well.”

173
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,500
So they all settled down with their family

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and I used to cook for them.

175
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:55,959
By cooking I won them over and they would do anything for me.

176
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:02,417
Absolutely. They’re so kind to me,

177
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,667
they would produce new, new technique that they knew,

178
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:14,291
they would produce an effect of marble out of the cement.

179
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:19,417
All kinds of art that they had they put there.

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,458
So such a big house with 20 bedrooms and five drawing rooms dining rooms

181
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:29,417
was created within one year’s time.

182
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,750
Not only that but the price of the house nobody can believe

183
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,792
was one tenth of the one that the architect would have taken.

184
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
But it was all written so well, everything done so well

185
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:48,333
because I didn’t know how to write accounts so what I used to do,

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,500
every day I used to say “Alright, today I take out so much money,

187
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:58,000
then this much was spent. Like that I wrote every day

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,999
and not one single rupee was missing in that.

189
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,125
So nobody could prosecute me, no problem

190
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,291
otherwise all the officers who built their houses there

191
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,500
had to go through lots of problems,

192
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,625
their income was taxed, this thing, nothing, nothing happened.

193
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:21,417
And I got such a huge house made in such a little money

194
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,542
and such a house that people said

195
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,000
that even Taj Mahal may fall down, this will not fall.

196
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,709
As I made a good foundation, everything,

197
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,875
because I had bricks so cheap.

198
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,166
The whole of that kiln I bought for no price at all

199
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,999
and half of it I sold back because so much remaining.

200
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:45,208
Then whatever I had bought the sand I brought it,

201
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,999
sold half of it because I didn't need it,

202
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,834
at double the price so I got my sand free.

203
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,250
The wood that I had brought from there

204
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,125
I got it properly chiseled out

205
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,333
and I had a little tank in which I put it

206
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:08,625
so the whole thing became absolutely, what you call that, weatherproof.

207
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:14,625
I got it out and half of it I used, half of it only,

208
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:20,000
for hundred windows and sixty doors and the rest of it I sold.

209
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,834
And even the chips were sold as burning for wood,

210
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,999
you see burning wood, what do you call that?

211
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,792
So you can imagine something was sold as timber

212
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,083
and some for the huts,

213
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,834
but I had to do cooking for them,

214
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,208
I had to look after their comfort,

215
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:45,834
I got them nice blankets and nice beds to sleep and this and that

216
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,999
so they were very happy.

217
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:52,000
That’s how a woman works out and everybody was amazed.

218
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,959
They could not find any faults with my, accounts,

219
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,000
they could not find faults with anything

220
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,959
and I told all my husband’s friends to keep five miles away from me.

221
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,709
Because he was working with the Prime Minister,

222
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,667
people would have said that: “Alright, She’s taking bribes” and things like that.

223
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:17,000
Then there was, another problem was that,

224
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,125
they would have come and told me: “This not good, that not good.”

225
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,999
I kept them out because only they can argue, men can only argue.

226
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,417
Women produce the results.

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,250
No conferences, nothing. I said: "Nothing doing",

228
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,417
"Let me do the job Myself."

229
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,709
Very nicely in the company of all these people I built the house,

230
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,917
a beautiful house which I think they have taken a film,

231
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:53,208
and you might be able to see the house that I built there.

232
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,583
So when the woman, who is a Sahaja yogini

233
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,583
must develop her special qualities

234
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,917
because she is very intuitive, woman is very intuitive.

235
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:09,291
She always reaches the right conclusion in no time.

236
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:14,333
If she’s a woman – but if she’s half-man and a little of a woman

237
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:17,999
then I don’t know what sort of a thing she is.

238
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,959
So a woman should try to be a woman, she’s so powerful,

239
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,709
she’s powerful like this Mother Earth who can bear every sort of thing

240
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:33,083
and she can give the best that is with her.

241
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Extremely sacrificing, extremely giving, forbearing, loving, forgiving.

242
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:49,000
When men develop the women’s quality then they become saints.

243
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,959
But not the woman’s quality that they run after women.

244
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,709
This kind of a nonsense is not there.

245
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,542
They have to be viras, they have to be chivalrous people,

246
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,000
They have to be brave

247
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:14,999
but with that they have to develop compassion, forgiveness.

248
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,917
But I think it is the other way round in Germany very much,

249
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,500
and I find around also among Western Sahaja Yogis

250
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,834
this is a very common affair going on.

251
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,333
Women develop horrible egos.

252
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:38,125
In India women work. Everything they do.

253
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:44,208
We have had great orators since long time, well known.

254
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:50,917
But they don’t have ego. My mother was Honours,

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,417
in those days when there were only two or three women

256
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,417
who had done such a degree,

257
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,999
but I never saw her with any ego in her.

258
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,709
My own daughters, one of them has done architecture,

259
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,125
and also interior decoration, she she’s not now working

260
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,125
because her husband is working all right,

261
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,917
but she makes houses for others, she draws for others,

262
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:19,709
she helps others freely. And she has such friends.

263
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,000
So what is the achievement of a woman?

264
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:28,250
She has more people around her.

265
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,000
Human power.

266
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,291
She has more human beings around her.

267
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,208
And what is the capacity of men?

268
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,959
They have all the bills of the house to be paid,

269
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,417
they have to pay for the insurance, the repairs of the car.

270
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,417
Let them do the dirty jobs.

271
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,125
Women receive all the love letters, from the children,

272
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,542
from the husband, from everyone.

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,500
They are loved. They are cared for.

274
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,500
Now because they have become manly

275
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,083
they don’t have all these advantages.

276
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:18,750
Like formerly if you are going in a bus they would give a seat to a lady.

277
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,291
Now nobody does that.

278
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,375
Once a lady was travelling, old lady

279
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,000
and there was one young fellow sitting there.

280
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,417
I said: “Why don’t you allow her to sit down?”

281
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,417
He said: “Why should I?

282
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,917
She’s also wearing a pant, I’m also wearing a pant.”

283
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,291
She was...this old lady was wearing trousers,

284
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,834
so he said: “Why should I give her seat, she’s wearing a trouser,

285
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,834
I’m wearing a trouser, what’s the difference?”

286
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,000
So all that is our advantage and privilege

287
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:53,625
we are losing by becoming men.

288
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And what do we gain?

289
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,834
Actually, on the contrary, I think in modern days

290
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:08,709
women are much more slaves of men than they were before.

291
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,000
They get very upset. Say there’s a Sahaja Yogini.

292
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,875
Now she’s caught up very badly and she has certain problems.

293
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,000
First thing she’ll think about

294
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,333
“Oh God, now my husband will leave me,

295
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:27,208
he’ll take away my children, where will I do?”

296
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,083
She’ll never think of Sahaja Yoga.

297
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,750
But I met one extraordinary woman, I must say she was a real woman.

298
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,750
She said: “Mother, because I’m schizophrenic

299
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:42,083
I want to get out of Sahaja Yoga. I’ll divorce my husband,

300
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,083
I don’t want to see my children,

301
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,083
Sahaja Yoga is much more important than me,

302
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:51,875
than my husband and my children."

303
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,583
"There's a woman", I said.

304
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,917
She said: “I am schizophrenic from childhood.

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,709
I’ve discovered it now and it comes back on me”.

306
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:01,125
But mostly women are worried about themselves.

307
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,208
“Oh God, I’ll have to leave my husband,”

308
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,750
means what they were doing was to sponge on the husband.

309
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,750
“I’ll have to leave my children.”

310
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,999
But what about leaving Sahaja Yoga?

311
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,417
If you think Sahaja Yoga is the most important

312
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,917
you’ll can get rid of your schizophrenia also.

313
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:26,208
Why should God help you? We are just thinking like ordinary women,

314
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,625
about yourself, only worried about yourself.

315
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,000
Not worried about Sahaja Yoga.

316
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:41,291
Same with some men, but men are not so much frightened

317
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,750
because they think they can stand on their legs.

318
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,000
And women should also know now they are Sahaja Yoginis

319
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,000
that they are Sahaja Yoginis and Mother is going to look after them.

320
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,500
But if you are worried about yourself only, your husband,

321
00:26:55,583 --> 00:27:01,333
my house, my children, then you are a gone case,

322
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,417
you are no more a woman now. It’s not the sign of a good woman.

323
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,333
A woman is that who loves all the children.

324
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:16,917
Her loving capacity’s great, but if she becomes miserly,

325
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,625
if she becomes small-minded, then she’s not a woman.

326
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,417
I told you about my grand-daughters,

327
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,208
I asked them: “What do you want to be?” They’re very small.

328
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:33,999
So they said: “We want to be a nurse or an air hostess.”

329
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,083
So I said: “Why? What is so great about these jobs?”

330
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,834
They said: “Grandmother in these two jobs only you can feed people.”

331
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:47,083
There’s no other job in which you can really feed other.

332
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:53,000
The joy of feeding others is greater than writing files in the office.

333
00:27:55,625 --> 00:28:00,208
Absolutely I tell you. It’s a horrid job to write files in the office, see.

334
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,709
It’s better to do some nice cooking,

335
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:13,000
thinking so many are going to eat and enjoy it,

336
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,417
than to do this dirty job.

337
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:20,917
But women have lost their heads, they are not level-headed now.

338
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,999
Become stupid.

339
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:30,291
Now in Germany you have to be very careful.

340
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,000
In Austria you have to be very careful.

341
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,125
Austrian women are great but I would say German women

342
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,208
that you don’t try to become men.

343
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:42,208
First of all the best way to stop it is not to talk too much.

344
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:49,750
If you start talking like men then all the bhoots will enter into you

345
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,500
and start talking like men only.

346
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,291
And then you will see how the men are controlled –

347
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:59,709
we Indian women know how to control our men much better than you do.

348
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,750
Why we don’t have divorces? Why we don’t have problems?

349
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,750
We quarrel all right, doesn’t matter,

350
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,291
but our men don’t run after another women.

351
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:17,959
We don’t dress up s.., I mean, so much, we don’t go to hairdressers,

352
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,291
we don’t have these beauty aids, all that.

353
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,917
So develop your self-respect.

354
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:30,291
You are the Shakti. You are the power.

355
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,834
If you make your men cabbages what sort of children you’ll have?

356
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:40,333
Cabbages only. Respect them.

357
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,917
Make them men, enjoy their manliness.

358
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:49,000
Then they’ll never give you up.

359
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,625
There’s no competition between the two.

360
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,750
I find the main problem today in Gemany is

361
00:29:57,834 --> 00:30:00,709
that the women have lost their senses.

362
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:04,917
This is I feel absolutely about German women.

363
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,625
Take to music, take to art. So much scope is there.

364
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:19,500
Today, who is remembered? See in here, who is remembered?

365
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:24,083
A musician, Mozart. Everyone remembers Mozart,

366
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:28,417
even on a chocolate you’ll find a Mozart there.

367
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,917
I don’t know poor thing did he ever eat any chocolates or not.

368
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:43,000
Or they will remember, see here, they have Michelangelo

369
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:48,542
or they’ll have Leonardo da Vinci, or they’ll have somebody like that.

370
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Nobody remembers who was the officer at that time,

371
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,291
running with the file, up and down.

372
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:10,917
So women have something that they can be of eternal value,

373
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,709
that they should develop.

374
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:16,500
The greatest thing is that woman can love, and love and love.

375
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,750
But when she becomes selfish and self-centred,

376
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:23,083
starts worrying about herself there’s no beauty in her love.

377
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,000
Today I took it up specially this thing

378
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,000
because today you are worshipping me as Kartiyeka.

379
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,000
Kartikeya was the son of Parvati Umar.

380
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:50,500
Who was just a mother of these two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

381
00:31:53,625 --> 00:32:04,333
And one day the parents Shankara and Parvati both of them said:

382
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:13,709
“Out of you two, the one who goes round the Mother Earth first time

383
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,999
will get a special prize.

384
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,208
So Kartikeya was the manly power,absolutely, and he said:

385
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:32,542
"Alright, I’ll start on his own conveyance” which was a peacock.

386
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,125
And Ganesha said to himself:

387
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,709
“Now look at me, I’m a little boy,

388
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:44,709
I am not like him and my conveyance is a little mouse.

389
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,917
How will I manage?” But then he thought:

390
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:54,417
'My Mother is higher than the whole universe.'

391
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,542
'What is this Mother Earth?’

392
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:02,291
So this Kartykeya was out, going round the Mother Earth.

393
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,333
Shri Ganesha went round his Mother three times.

394
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,417
And he got the prize!

395
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:16,208
Because of that motherly qualities for Him She’s the highest,

396
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,125
even higher than Sadashiva.

397
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,999
But surprisingly that is what Sadashiva likes.

398
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,834
That you respect your mother. The motherhood in you.

399
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,999
The womanhood in you.

400
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:39,417
‘Where the women are respectable and respected

401
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,709
there the Gods reside.’

402
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,417
Women are very important.

403
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,792
Of course I must blame the Western men also.

404
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:49,000
the way they have ill-treated their women,

405
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:53,083
have kept out of religion,, have always put them down,

406
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,000
I mean, India we had Muslims doing that

407
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:58,834
but they are even very sophisticated aggressors

408
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,625
and they did it very badly and they kept all of them down.

409
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,999
But doesn’t matter.

410
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Still, forgive them and try to be women.

411
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:20,834
Very powerful. The powers of a woman are that of love,

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,625
which are the powers of God. And that is to be used

413
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,834
than to use other argumentative intellectualism, all nonsense.

414
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,625
Don’t waste your energy with that.

415
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:38,625
I would like, specially the Sahaja Yoginis of Germany,

416
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,000
to become more and more ladylike.

417
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:48,291
It doesn’t mean good cooking only but in the attitude towards life.

418
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
To think in a wider way

419
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:58,333
that the whole Sahaja Yoga depends on our love capacity.

420
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:02,125
We have to be extremely loving, extremely kind,

421
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:05,667
looking after Sahaja Yogis,

422
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,417
giving them all the joy that is possible.

423
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:17,999
Otherwise in this country they can become like vampires.

424
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,291
So be very careful and for men also I would say

425
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,999
if there are women of that kind you must respect,

426
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:32,000
you must give them all their privileges, look after them.

427
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,834
They look after children but give them all the assistance,

428
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,125
all the money that is needed by them.

429
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,834
Do not ask for accounts and things, let them manage it.

430
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:47,500
At the most you’ll become bankrupt, as it is you are.

431
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:56,083
But first see what is their attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is.

432
00:35:56,125 --> 00:36:01,125
I’ve seen in the families where the women are in charge of the purse

433
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:04,208
always we get much more money for Sahaja Yoga work

434
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:08,000
than from the houses where the men are in control.

435
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,542
It’s very surprising. When men are in control

436
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:15,208
they have to think of their car,

437
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,917
they have to think of many big things,

438
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:23,083
but when women are in control they know how to save money,

439
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,500
as I have shown you how I have saved money.

440
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,750
Men can never save. They can never save money.

441
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,542
Only the women can save but if they have a larger interest

442
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,834
otherwise if they are self indulgent they’ll finish off all the money

443
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:40,083
by going into the shop to buy a shirt for a man

444
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:44,208
they’ll buy all saris for themselves. They can do like that.

445
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:48,542
But if they have wider interests, if they have greater interest,

446
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:53,208
they can use money so cleverly

447
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:57,834
that they’ll have always money to spend for others. What do I do?

448
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:00,291
What has, whatever my husband gives me to run the house –

449
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,709
it’s quite a lot I should say – but I stinge on things,

450
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:08,333
I go to the main markets, get things from there,

451
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:11,709
try to save money on that, save here, save on my clothes.

452
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:18,208
I, first time I have given my sweaters for dry cleaning in a good shop.

453
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,834
That’s how a woman saves and then she spends for the general good.

454
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Because that is her real satisfaction.

455
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,959
If we develop that kind of a balanced view about our married life,

456
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,834
about our social life we’ll be ideal people in this world.

457
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,959
About school also, I have said it, very clearly.

458
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,125
Now if you want to hear about it

459
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,999
I would request – have you got that pamphlet with you?

460
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,834
Wanted to read it.

461
00:37:56,333 --> 00:38:03,917
Uh? No you don’t have. That’s just like men.

462
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,750
They themselves said they would like to read it here you see.

463
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:23,125
If you ask men to do the cooking everything will be missing. So,

464
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:28,750
Shri Mataji, may I most respectfully ask you,

465
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:32,917
is there any advantage at all in being a man?

466
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:49,291
Without the man woman cannot express herself.

467
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:53,625
She cannot express, because she is the potential.

468
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:58,625
He is the kinetic. It’s absolutely relative terminology.

469
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:02,834
You cannot, exist without a man, you cannot.

470
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:06,709
Even if, supposing, if you have all the fragrance in the Mother Earth

471
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,625
unless and until you have the flowers

472
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:11,709
how will you know there is fragrance in Mother Earth?

473
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,291
Men are most important otherwise what will they do?

474
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,333
All their energy will be all rotten.

475
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:29,500
So if women are the Mother Earth you are the flowers.

476
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:39,709
Advantage what? You are the people who, ...everybody sees you.

477
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,750
Running around like Kartikeya.

478
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:59,083
What can we do? You are like that.

479
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:05,625
You cannot sit at home. You cannot even in the train,

480
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:09,542
if you are going, you’ll find as soon as the train will stop

481
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,999
all the men will get out of the train. They can’t sit there.

482
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,709
Like, I told my husband:

483
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,834
“What is this all the time you are running out of the house?

484
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:28,417
Why can't you sit in the house for some time? You must sit.

485
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:33,291
So he said: "No, in our side if any man, sits in the house

486
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,834
he’s called as ghargusana",

487
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,750
means 'who is all the time in the house', you see.

488
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,333
And I said: “What do they call to man

489
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,125
who always runs away from the house gharbhagna

490
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,917
Means 'the run, runner away, who runs away'.

491
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,709
There should be something in between.

492
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,834
But that’s manly, it’s all right.

493
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,959
But we can, with Sahaja Yoga, what we can do

494
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:54,834
is to form a little balance between both the things.

495
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:00,917
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it gives a balance.

496
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,542
Then you start be…enjoying each other’s company so much

497
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:08,000
that even in the house you enjoy, outside also enjoy.

498
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:12,291
So you can be together in the house, also outside.

499
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:18,208
The interests are the same because the interest becomes the same.

500
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:23,959
Like the flowers who fall on the Mother Earth

501
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,000
make the Mother Earth fragrant

502
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,917
and then we can say that Mother Earth is fragrant.

503
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:37,000
As beautiful as that. Alright.

504
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,083
So for education I’ve already given instructions

505
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,834
and I’ve already talked about it

506
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:47,542
that we are not to make a big ado out of this Maria Montessori

507
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:52,834
and this and that. We are going to have Sahaja Yoga schools.

508
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,333
All nonsense, because I have seen

509
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,000
those who are teaching in Maria Montessori style,

510
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,834
the women have become horrible.

511
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,083
Was amazed the amount of ego they have developed in themselves.

512
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,625
So you become Sahaja Yoga teachers

513
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,125
and it’s going to be a Sahaja Yoga school.

514
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:21,125
In, Sydney or in Melbourne,

515
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,750
we started the school in Melbourne very nicely

516
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,208
and now they are going to have it in Sydney the same way.

517
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:31,959
And openly it is a Sahaja Yoga school, there’s no fear about it.

518
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,625
Openly it’s a Sahaja Yoga school,

519
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:38,333
and then people have achieved so much out of it.

520
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,750
We, why should we take any garb like that?

521
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,834
We should go all out to say its a Sahaja Yoga school.

522
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:48,000
So you, the teachers, also become experts in Sahaja Yoga,

523
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:53,333
so they have to be good Sahaja Yogis, Yoginis or Sahaja Yogis.

524
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,959
They should not be egoistical, there should be no ego in them,

525
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,917
they should not be catching,

526
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,500
anybody who’s catching is not a good teacher for Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:05,291
It’s not like in a Maria Montessori school

528
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,917
that in the night the teacher drinks, smokes

529
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:10,500
and morning time she’s a Maria Montessori teacher.

530
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,291
Here you have to be a Sahaja Yogini first

531
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:17,083
and then only you can teach in a Sahaja Yoga school.

532
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,417
You have to have that quality, that is very important,

533
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,208
as it is important that we should get students who are Realized Souls

534
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,083
or who can get Realization.

535
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:35,083
Alright, so today’s puja is specially for Kartikeya.

536
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:53,709
Kartikeya represents the great, we can say the captor or leader of all the ganas,

537
00:43:55,125 --> 00:44:01,000
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

538
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,208
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

539
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:14,625
and because German character is to be in command of everything

540
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,959
we are going to have this puja

541
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,500
where the men will be in command of their spirits

542
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,750
and their manly qualities

543
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,500
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

544
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:38,959
To be in command is different from to be a master.

545
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,917
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

546
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:50,917
He does not own it, that is also lost.

547
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,959
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

548
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,959
And that is the state we have to come to now,

549
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,417
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

550
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,917
The other way round.

551
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,208
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

552
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:16,999
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

553
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,500
Innocence is there,

554
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:27,709
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

555
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:32,750
gives you a power of that commandment.

556
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,291
He commands. After the Guru Puja

557
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:42,625
it's better that we should have the power to command others

558
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,417
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

559
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,999
through their talking, through their dynamism,

560
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,208
through their personal achievements;

561
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:03,500
for the women through their loving power,

562
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:09,125
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

563
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,208
forgiveness, compassion.

564
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:18,625
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

565
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,792
means it’s not that what we have

566
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:24,417
but in a position we are to command.

567
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,709
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

568
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,125
May God Bless You.

569
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,458
So let us start the Puja.

570
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:55,291
Who made this? You made it - this Ganesha?

571
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,917
Such a sweet thing.

572
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:06,834
You are very good, I must say. May God bless you!

573
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:17,333
Get some German people to do it also.

574
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:33,417
Let us have some more people here from Germany.

575
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:37,792
Ladies also, of course.

576
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:46,959
The one who has made Ganesha - is she German too?

577
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:54,999
This one also should wash.

578
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:10,000
All those who wrote letters for Me to come to Germany

579
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,792
should come to wash My feet.

580
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:16,750
May God bless you! May God bless you! Thank you!

581
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:25,834
Take out that one from inside. Now take that out. There is no need.

582
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,583
We call her Kamala, Kamala.

583
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:53,500
Kamala is the name of the goddess, all right?

584
00:55:53,667 --> 00:56:02,166
Kamal Lakshmi. Kamala. May God bless you.

585
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:25,583
We can have a singing little bit, because there are two ladies more.

586
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:31,667
And Hugo still has to do it.

587
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,208
Good.

588
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That's it.

589
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
May God bless you.

590
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,834
Come to the other side.

591
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,917
Who are the ladies now? There are some more ladies? Finished?

592
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Good.

593
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,083
Use the same water

594
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:50,667
They can use the same water, because too much water already there.

595
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,250
Now we can say the one thousand names of Kartikeya.

596
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:46,000
No, 108.

597
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:54,000
I thought 1000 would be good idea, but let it be 108.

598
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:01,834
Let`s see how it works out with 108.

599
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,166
Say it loudly.

600
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:59,291
Say it loudly, it's not clear.

601
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:08,208
No, not yet. Get him another one,

602
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,625
let him have one more,

603
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,000
because must be clearly, otherwise it has no meaning.

604
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:58,375
In these 108 names, if you have noticed,

605
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:06,458
they have shown that Kartikeya is the innocence

606
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:11,542
that is acting on the right hand side, in the Pingala.

607
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:17,000
and that is also - it is very much related to Prana.

608
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:23,208
It gives you Prana. Prana is the vital breath that we take

609
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:26,166
- breathe in and breathe out.

610
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:28,375
so it is related to the right side.

611
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,834
Then also it is related to eternity - Anantari.

612
01:29:32,999 --> 01:29:37,834
Anantar is the snake, the Shesha.

613
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:41,458
which is the brother of Vishnu.

614
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:46,999
So it is He who is represented here as Kartikeya.

615
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,417
He is called as Anantar.

616
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,375
So he is the fire.

617
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,583
He is the one who ignites within you the capacity

618
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:01,000
to consume the force,

619
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
also the capacity to command the people

620
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:16,750
and also the capacity to be a person full of brilliance.

621
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:20,917
You see, an innocent person could be very brilliant.

622
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:27,792
All these capacities are expressed in Kartikeya's Swarupa

623
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:30,000
in his state.

624
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:34,000
Today by worshipping Kartikeya we have to know,

625
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:38,250
that Kartikeya is now awakened within us.

626
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:44,999
And with that capacity we have to fight.

627
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,000
Ultimately He is the Nishkalanka.

628
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,417
He is the one who is the fighter.

629
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,999
So from Ganesha to Christ to Nishkalanka.

630
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:56,208
These are the three stages

631
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:59,208
into which the innocence has gone.

632
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:07,834
From Ganesha to Kartikeya and now to Christ.

633
01:31:07,999 --> 01:31:11,208
And from Christ to Nishkalanka.

634
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:14,834
In the form of Nishkalanka He is innocent.

635
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:18,208
so there is no Kalanka, there is no spot on Him, nothing.

636
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:20,417
He is absolutely clean, immaculate.

637
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,999
Plus He is fiery.

638
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,500
Plus He has all the qualities of Ekadesha Rudra.

639
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:31,709
Means the eleven qualities or the forces of Shiva

640
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:33,709
which can kill..

641
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:39,709
So He has a capacity to kill and destroy that is evil,

642
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:46,999
and to give blessings and courage to His followers.

643
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:52,375
This is the last incarnation, which is called Kalaki.

644
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:56,166
In normal words you call it Kalaki, is actually Nishkalanka.

645
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,000
Is the white horse.

646
01:31:58,125 --> 01:32:03,208
So it is the Kartikeya who sits on the white horse.

647
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:06,999
So how innocence grows within you now

648
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,417
is up to the point of Kartikeya.

649
01:32:11,542 --> 01:32:14,999
This has been today done on this land,

650
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,999
Deutschland as you call it,

651
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,834
where Kartikeya is to be born within you, to be awakened within you.

652
01:32:21,999 --> 01:32:24,000
May God bless you!

653
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:43,000
Now if you want you can sing some songs

654
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,999
as "Ya Devi Sarva Buteshu", which one you like.

655
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:49,417
I would like to have ladies here, seven married ladies

656
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,417
just to help me out.

657
01:32:56,500 --> 01:33:01,417
First we'll have little girls if there are in here.

658
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,625
The little girls have to come up.

659
01:33:06,999 --> 01:33:10,041
Little later, when you have to garland Me, all right?

660
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:12,999
Now the girls have to come.

661
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,417
Where are the girls? All the girls have to come.

662
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,417
Who are all the other girls who are here?

663
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,417
All right. Come along. Right, come on.

664
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,999
You also come along, both of you.

665
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
All right, you also come, both of you.

666
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:46,500
Sit down. Sit down.

667
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:53,834
If there is any unmarried girl, big unmarried girl - please come.

668
01:34:02,999 --> 01:34:05,625
Somebody who is not yet married.

669
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,999
Someone - come.

670
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,709
Remove this one, I think. Ask somebody to remove this.

671
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:29,792
Gregoire: "Shri Mataji, first before we sing the hynm to the Goddess

672
01:35:29,917 --> 01:35:35,917
we would like to read to You an amended version of the Lord's Prayer."

673
01:35:39,999 --> 01:35:41,208
Our Mother

674
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:43,000
Who art on earth

675
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:45,709
Hallowed be Thy name

676
01:35:45,999 --> 01:35:48,333
Thy kingdom come

677
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,500
Thy will be done

678
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,875
On earth as it is in heaven

679
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,208
Give us this day Your divine vibrations

680
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,208
And forgive us our trespasses

681
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:04,834
As we forgive those

682
01:36:04,834 --> 01:36:07,208
Who trespass against us

683
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,625
And lead us not into maya

684
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:12,625
But deliver us from evil

685
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:14,417
For Thine is the Father

686
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,834
