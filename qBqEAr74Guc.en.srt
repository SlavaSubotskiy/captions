1
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,000
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,800
At the very outset, I have to tell you that

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,080
truth is what it is.

4
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,760
We cannot conceptualize it

5
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,320
or we cannot change it.

6
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,520
Unfortunately we cannot also know it

7
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,840
with this human awareness.

8
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,680
We have to become a subtler being to know the truth;

9
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,600
that is, we have to be the Spirit.

10
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,680
For that one has to understand that

11
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,800
it's a evolutionary living process.

12
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,560
It is a living happening within us which makes you the Spirit,

13
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,600
for which you cannot pay,

14
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,760
you cannot put any efforts,

15
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:25,480
but it just works because you are seekers of truth.

16
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:42,560
Whatever I am telling you, you have to listen to it

17
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,400
with an open mind of a scientist.

18
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,320
If it is proved to be

19
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:08,080
the truth, you have to accept it as honest people,

20
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,160
because it is for your benevolence

21
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,640
and benevolence of the whole world.

22
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,760
We see beautiful flowers here, but we take them for granted.

23
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,200
We do not even think that they just come from small little seeds.

24
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,240
Look at our eyes, what a micro-camera it is,

25
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,600
but we take it for granted.

26
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,640
So, one must understand that there is some power

27
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,960
which does this living work.

28
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,440
So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind,

29
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,280
this ego or conditionings,

30
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,880
but you are, but you are pure Spirit.

31
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,840
The second truth is that there is a subtle power

32
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,200
of divine love which does all the living work.

33
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,160
Through that power only we have become from amoeba to this stage,

34
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,480
and there is a very small breakthrough

35
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,880
that we have to achieve, to know the truth.

36
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
We do not know the absolute truth.

37
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,360
That is why we are quarreling with each other,

38
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,200
fighting with each other, we have wars.

39
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,360
But if all of us know the truth, it is only one...

40
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
As you all can see Me sitting here,

41
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,000
you all know that I am sitting here, there's no quarrel about it.

42
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,760
But when you become the Spirit, then you can feel

43
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,800
this all-pervading Power which you have never felt before.

44
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,040
You feel it on your fingertips, and also

45
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,800
you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

46
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:40,880
In the Bible there is the God Almighty

47
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,200
as the Father God, and we have the Son God,

48
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:55,280
and the Trinity, the third one is the Holy Ghost.

49
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:17,280
But how can you have Father and the Son, and no Mother?

50
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,520
The women are called as "second citizen"

51
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,560
because they say that She was not on the table

52
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,600
of the twelve apostles, who were having the Last Supper.

53
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,520
But then how do you have Paul there,

54
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,680
who was not sitting on the supper table also?

55
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,680
But people could feel the Mother of Christ

56
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,440
as a Goddess, so they called her as a Madonna.

57
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,880
And I can't understand,

58
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,040
those who do not want Her as the Goddess

59
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,000
go and worship Her as Black Madonna in Poland.

60
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,600
In the same way in every religion they have created problems,

61
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,800
because they wanted to have it organized

62
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,800
the way they wanted to have it.

63
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,320
So the people concluded that there is no God,

64
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,000
because whatever religion one may follow, they can commit any sin.

65
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,960
So they lost faith in God.

66
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,800
But when you will become Spirit

67
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,880
you will know that there is God Almighty

68
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:25,640
and His love, His All-pervading living power.

69
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,560
It can be proved by Sahaja Yoga

70
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,480
that there is God, and there is His power of love.

71
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,800
Whether you believe in God blindly

72
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,840
or don't believe in It, it's just the same.

73
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,240
Many people come and tell Me that,

74
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,000
"Mother, we pray to God and nothing happens to us.

75
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,440
We are just like people who do not believe in God."

76
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,840
The reason is, you are not connected with God.

77
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,800
If this machine is not connected to the mains, it won't work.

78
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,200
If your telephone is not connected, it won't work.

79
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,680
So the first thing is to get connected to this all-pervading Power.

80
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,920
And all of you have got this divinity within yourself.

81
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,680
You all can get your Self-Realization, and get connected

82
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,080
to this all-pervading Power.

83
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,400
You should have no diffidence about it.

84
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
It's so simple.

85
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,960
"Sahaja" means it is born with you,

86
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,920
and all of you have the right to get this connection,

87
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,600
yoga, without any difficulty.

88
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,080
As a result of that,

89
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,000
all your physical, mental, emotional problems can be solved.

90
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,760
Even your material problems are solved.

91
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:47,160
Above all, you enter into the Kingdom of God,

92
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,200
which is the ocean of joy.

93
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,000
This is what is going to happen to you.

94
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:14,240
This is extremely simple, which you cannot achieve

95
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,640
by reading, by studying or by doing anything.

96
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,640
It is not the mental act,

97
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,960
but it's a living happening.

98
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,360
Today I think you have heard about the Kundalini

99
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,320
and the power which is within you.

100
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,720
Tomorrow I will tell you about the nature of the Spirit.

101
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,800
In this short time it is difficult to give the complete idea

102
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,640
of this knowledge of the roots.

103
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,120
I must have given at least four thousand lectures

104
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,600
on this subject, in English language only.

105
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,160
So, like here there are so many lights

106
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,280
which we can put on with one switch,

107
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,080
but if I have to tell you about the electricity and its

108
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,200
history, and how it came here to Prague,

109
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
you'll get bored.

110
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,520
Only one switch can open the light,

111
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,720
because it is all built in.

112
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,040
In the same way it is all built in within you.

113
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,360
So it is better to get this enlightenment,

114
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,400
and then to know about the subtle subject.

115
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,280
But in any case,

116
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,600
I would like you to ask Me questions for a short time.

117
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,560
Only My request is not to ask Me questions

118
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,720
which are not related to the subject.

119
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
Please, try to understand

120
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,120
that I have not come here to take anything from you.

121
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:09,920
I have come here to give you what is your own.

122
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,680
You may ask Me questions.

123
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,440
Remove all this from there.

124
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,880
You can remove all this from the front, because people can't see Me.

125
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,360
Very cold but it's all right.

126
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,760
I'll have My spectacles. It's all right,

127
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,640
just I'll have My spectacles. Spectacles.

128
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Loudly.

129
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,480
She said You were helping her in Vienna working on her ears,

130
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,360
but she doesn't hear yet.

131
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,120
All right, that's different.

132
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,280
I will see to it again. Did you meditate?

133
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,680
All right, we'll see it again.

134
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,880
All right, sit down, we'll see it again.

135
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,200
We'll see it tomorrow.

136
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,800
They have no questions. Wonderful people!

137
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
When You open the Kundalini to the people,

138
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,400
how can the people keep it if they are not ready for this?

139
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,080
I first of all told you, have no diffidence,

140
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,960
and don't judge yourself.

141
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,440
All right.

142
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,240
The question was, if they are not ready.

143
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,200
Your Kundalini knows everything about you.

144
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:19,400
She is your Mother, your individual Mother,

145
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,920
and she's anxious to give you your second birth.

146
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,040
Hearing now?

147
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,680
She started hearing.

148
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,400
Little bit.

149
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,200
She has said that to awaken Kundalini,

150
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,000
to awake Kundalini we have to meditate for a long time.

151
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
What does it mean, a long time to meditate?

152
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,160
You have already done it in previous lives, everything.

153
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:49,440
That's why you are here. You are destined to be here.

154
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,240
This lady wants.

155
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,960
How do You see the future of the Earth?

156
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,520
Of what?

157
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,800
Of the Earth. Of our Earth, of our living, in the future.

158
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,480
In Prague or?

159
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:52,280
How do You view the future of the mankind?

160
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,480
Great!

161
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,240
There are many wars in the world nowadays,

162
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,520
and very much of violence. Am I to understand

163
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,040
that these wars must come before the joy will come?

164
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,000
You see, these wars are because of the problems

165
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
with human beings who have created them.

166
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,680
If you could transform human beings,

167
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,560
these problems will be solved automatically.

168
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,720
If certain number of people are transformed, they'll trigger it.

169
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Already there are thousands who have been transformed,

170
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,600
and you can transform others when you are transformed.

171
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,040
This lady.

172
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,480
She's painting and doing very many things

173
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,760
with the romanys, with the gypsies.

174
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,760
Any race, whether these are gypsies or any race,

175
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,120
can get their transformation.

176
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,720
It has nothing to do with your race, your nationality,

177
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:43,040
or your religion, nothing to do. It is something inner, innate.

178
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,840
As long as you are a human being it will work out.

179
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
The best part of it,

180
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,840
that all so-called bad karmas are also washed off.

181
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,680
Only human beings think that they do bad karmas, not the animals.

182
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,720
He's asking whether this Sahaja Yoga

183
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,040
is based on faith in [unclear], in Christ.

184
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,760
Of course, of course.

185
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:30,800
But Christ has said that those who are not against us are with us.

186
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,760
All these incarnations and all these prophets

187
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,640
are related to each other.

188
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,680
So we see them separated,

189
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,040
and this creates hatred between people.

190
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,280
This one is there.

191
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,280
Shri Mataji, do You believe that Jesus Christ

192
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,520
was killed for our sins, to help us?

193
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,880
Yes, He suffered for us. He had to do that.

194
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,800
But incarnations actually never suffer.

195
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,000
He had to do it, which I will tell you later on,

196
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,880
because the way He had to go through a center of Agnya,

197
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,920
of optic chiasm was closed like this.

198
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,240
So He had to get crucified for.

199
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,800
His message is His resurrection,

200
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,720
not crucifixion, Resurrection.

201
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,040
But now we need not suffer.

202
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,200
So those who say you must suffer, they are absolutely wrong.

203
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,760
Are we going to suffer more than Christ?

204
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,200
How can we help the people who don't want

205
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,040
to get Realization, to get it?

206
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,760
They can't.

207
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,880
They can't. You cannot force it.

208
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

209
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,520
If you do not have pure desire, I cannot surpass your freedom.

210
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:01,200
It has to be a personality like a good seed

211
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,080
which can be embedded in the Mother Earth.

212
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:24,160
But you must have desire, otherwise it cannot be worked.

213
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,160
You cannot force a seed to sprout.

214
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,640
Now, this gentleman has a question. Yes.

215
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,760
[Anyone is just] will learn how to raise our Kundalini?

216
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,560
All right, that's a good question,

217
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,160
that by raising the Kundalini of others

218
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,440
and also establishing yourself,

219
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,320
you become a righteous person,

220
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,080
and another also becomes the righteous person.

221
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,000
They become really saintly people.

222
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,240
They are peaceful, without any lust and greed.

223
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,600
After all, this world is made by human beings,

224
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,960
and if the human beings are transformed,

225
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,000
the world will be transformed.

226
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,360
Shri Mataji please are you connect with the Saint Grail?

227
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,080
I don't know what you are saying, I don't follow.

228
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,040
You should not worry about Me.

229
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,640
I will not tell you anything about Myself.

230
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,680
Christ said that He was the Son of God, which He was.

231
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,000
But He said that, so they crucified Him.

232
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,640
People don't want to hear truth,

233
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,480
unless and until they are realized souls.

234
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,840
So I do not want to get crucified;

235
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,240
I have to do My work still.

236
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,120
As it is because I say you cannot take money,

237
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,560
all these people who have made a business out of religion

238
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,360
and business out of all this false guru propagation,

239
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,520
they are all against Me.

240
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,000
Also the religions have made a business,

241
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,880
all the religions have made a business nowadays,

242
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,320
so they don't like Me.

243
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,080
You cannot make business out of God.

244
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,640
So now I think we'll have the session of Self-Realization.

245
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,200
For this again I have to say that I cannot force it

246
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,200
on anyone whatsoever.

247
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:12,200
Only those who want it and desire it, should be in the hall.

248
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,560
Otherwise they should leave the hall.

249
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,960
The whole thing starts shaking if you get up, you know.

250
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,840
Shri Mataji, they want to take Your vibrations down.

251
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,920
They want to have their vibrations, they want Your vibrations down,

252
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,600
and get their Realization.

253
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,640
I don't understand. You come from this side, I can't hear you.

254
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,080
Shri Mataji, I've told them they should go down

255
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,200
and sit, sit in front of You to have Your vibrations.

256
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,640
They wanted that?

257
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,040
See, once, even you come up it shakes and they get up with shakes.

258
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,520
so let it be as they are. The whole things are shaking.

259
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,320
And those who do not want should not sit here, please.

260
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:41,240
So, at the very outset I have to again tell you

261
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,840
that be fully confident that you all will get your Realization.

262
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,240
The second thing is, there are three conditions

263
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,440
which you have to understand.

264
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,160
The first condition is that you have to forget the past,

265
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,000
and you are not to feel guilty at all.

266
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,680
You are after all human beings,

267
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,120
and if you have done any mistakes, it's all right, you are not God.

268
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,560
But feeling guilty is some sort of a mental torture.

269
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,560
But also when you feel guilty,

270
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,960
this center here catches on the left-hand side,

271
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,680
and you physically also torture yourself.

272
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,320
Because when this center is caught up,

273
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,880
then you get angina, spondylitis, all these diseases.

274
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,800
So what's the use of feeling guilty?

275
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,960
Please do not feel guilty.

276
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,400
When I say "Don't feel guilty", many people are leaving,

277
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,240
because they want to feel guilty and get sick.

278
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,240
Now the third condition is

279
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:43,960
that you should forgive everyone in general.

280
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,360
Some people say it is very difficult,

281
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,520
but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

282
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,040
Again, when you don't forgive,

283
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,600
then you torture yourself for nothing at all.

284
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,080
So you should not even think of people whom you are to forgive.

285
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,000
Just say "I forgive everyone."

286
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,360
and immediately you'll feel better.

287
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
That's all.

288
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,120
Now to take the help from the Mother Earth,

289
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,880
you have to take out your shoes, that's all.

290
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:17,320
Please put your left and right foot away from each other.

291
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,880
Just for about five, ten minutes, that's all.

292
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:40,360
Now as he has told you, there are two powers, left and right

293
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,600
So...

294
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,880
After, after, after the meditation, all right?

295
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,480
This little one. I'd like to take one.

296
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,560
All right. Let him, now. Now, that's all. Sit down, sit down.

297
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:16,440
So put your left side on one side, and right side on another.

298
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,040
Left side represents your desire power

299
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,040
and right side represents your action power.

300
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:54,800
So please put your left hand on the left side, on the lap,

301
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,280
and the right side we will use for

302
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,720
nourishing our centers on the left-hand side.

303
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,960
First we'll show you

304
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:42,080
how to touch your different centers

305
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,440
on the left hand side,

306
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,000
to nourish them.

307
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,920
So please see first of all, and then we'll have to close the eyes.

308
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,920
Put the right hand on your heart.

309
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,640
This is the center where there's the reflection

310
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,800
of God Almighty as Spirit.

311
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,600
And Kundalini is the reflection

312
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,880
of the Holy Ghost, the primordial Mother.

313
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,880
Now, please take your right hand

314
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,400
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

315
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,400
This is the center of your mastery.

316
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,080
When you become the Spirit,

317
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,720
you become your own guide.

318
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,200
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,

319
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,200
on the left-hand side.

320
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:03,760
This is the center which is for pure knowledge,

321
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,160
with which we work out all divine work.

322
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,880
Then raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

323
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,800
on the left-hand side.

324
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:48,120
Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

325
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,800
and turn your head to your right.

326
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:05,120
This center you catch when you feel guilty.

327
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:15,000
Now please take your hand on your forehead across,

328
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,080
and bend your head as far as possible.

329
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:37,080
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

330
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,000
Now please take your right hand to the back side of your head

331
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,040
and push back your head.

332
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,840
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

333
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,440
without counting mistakes,

334
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:24,240
for your satisfaction you have to say,

335
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:31,840
forgive, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power.

336
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,240
Now you have to stretch your palm

337
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,920
and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area,

338
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,960
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

339
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,320
Now push back your fingers,

340
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,720
and put down your head as far as possible,

341
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:28,200
so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Push back your fingers.

342
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,160
Put down your head.

343
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,240
Now you move your scalp seven times clockwise, slowly.

344
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,400
Put down your head.

345
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,800
Now, that's all you have to do.

346
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,600
Now please

347
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,360
put both your feet apart from each other,

348
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,120
left hand towards Me,

349
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:41,960
and do not sit too much bent down or forward, but comfortably.

350
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,560
Now, please put your right hand on your heart.

351
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,880
Left hand towards Me, on your lap.

352
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,360
Now please close your eyes.

353
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,960
Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question, three times.

354
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,400
You can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" -

355
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,640
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

356
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,040
Loudly.

357
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:59,200
If you are the Spirit you become your guide, your master.

358
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,760
So please take down your right hand

359
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,120
on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part.

360
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,960
We are working only on the left side.

361
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,080
Here you have to

362
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,280
ask another question,

363
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,920
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

364
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,720
I have already told you that I cannot force

365
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,040
pure knowledge on you,

366
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,680
because I respect your freedom.

367
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,920
You have to ask for it.

368
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,960
Now please take your right hand

369
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,520
in the lower portion of your abdomen, and press it hard.

370
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,960
Here you have to say six times,

371
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,480
because this center has got six petals,

372
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,960
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

373
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,840
Six times.

374
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,720
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

375
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,440
the Kundalini starts rising higher.

376
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,960
So now we have to nourish the upper centers

377
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,080
with our self-confidence.

378
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,240
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion

379
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,520
of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

380
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,280
Here you have to say with full confidence,

381
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,400
ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

382
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,200
I've already told you that you are not this body,

383
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,240
not this mind, not this ego or these conditionings,

384
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,800
but you are pure Spirit.

385
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,760
So now raise your right hand onto your heart,

386
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,880
and here you have to say

387
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,200
with full confidence ten times, twelve times,

388
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:00,520
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

389
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,080
Ten times, twelve times.

390
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,040
This all-pervading Power is the power

391
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:31,560
of compassion and love.

392
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:46,320
It is the ocean of absolute knowledge.

393
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,080
Loudly, loudly.

394
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,080
Loudly you must say.

395
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,800
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

396
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,440
and whatever mistakes you might commit,

397
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,680
this ocean can dissolve it very easily.

398
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,960
So please forgive yourself, and put your hand

399
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,520
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

400
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,760
and turn your head to your right.

401
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,160
Here with full confidence say sixteen times,

402
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:59,200
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

403
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,440
I have already told you

404
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,480
that whether you forgive or don't forgive,

405
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,400
you don't do anything;

406
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,600
but if you don't forgive, then

407
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,200
you play into wrong hands.

408
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,560
So,

409
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,720
now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across,

410
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,960
and please put down your head as far as possible.

411
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,160
Here you have to say with full confidence

412
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,680
from your heart, not how many times,

413
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,000
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

414
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,880
Now,

415
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,520
please take your right hand on the back side of your head,

416
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,200
and push back your head as far as possible.

417
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Here, without feeling guilty,

418
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,840
without counting your mistakes,

419
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,720
just for your satisfaction you have to say

420
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,000
from your heart, not how many times,

421
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,960
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me."

422
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,280
Now stretch your hand fully,

423
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,760
your palm fully, and put the center of your palm

424
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
on top of your head.

425
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,960
Now push back your fingers.

426
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,840
Please put down your head.

427
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:59,200
Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom.

428
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:11,800
You have to ask for your Self-Realization.

429
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:25,720
So move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise, asking,

430
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,040
"Mother, please give me Self-Realization" - seven times.

431
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,320
Now please take down your hands.

432
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,960
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

433
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,480
[Gavin], get up.

434
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,040
And now put the right hand towards Me like this.

435
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,840
Please stand up.

436
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,960
Please stand up and show otherwise they will not know.

437
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,120
Please put right hand towards Me,

438
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,000
and put down your head

439
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,000
and see for yourself with the left hand,

440
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:48,840
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

441
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,080
Loudly, loudly, loudly.

442
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,880
If it is hot, means you have not forgiven,

443
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,880
so please forgive and don’t feel guilty.

444
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,400
Now left hand towards Me,

445
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,640
but bend your head, bend your head.

446
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:44,200
Now please see with your right hand

447
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,920
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head,

448
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,480
or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

449
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,920
Don’t put the hand on top of your head. Away from it.

450
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,040
Sometimes you get it far away.

451
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,040
Now please put again your right hand.

452
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,080
And put down your head and see for yourself

453
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,840
again with the left hand.

454
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:52,320
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, like this.

455
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,000
Loudly, loudly.

456
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,440
And push back your head.

457
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,480
And ask any one of these questions three times,

458
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,080
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

459
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:31,440
or “Mother, is this the power of Divine Love?”

460
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,560
or “Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

461
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,400
Ask any one of these questions, any one question three times.

462
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,280
Now take down your hands please.

463
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,840
Now put your hands like this towards Me. Open your eyes.

464
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,680
Watch Me without thinking.

465
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:41,080
Those who have felt cold or hot breeze,

466
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,680
on their fingertips

467
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:49,840
or in their hands, or on the fontanel bone area,

468
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,560
please raise both your hands.

469
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,080
Prague!

470
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,640
All of you have become saints now. I bow to you all.

471
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,160
Your saintly life has started.

472
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,840
Tomorrow I will come again and explain to you about the Spirit.

473
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,880
May God bless you all.

474
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,480
Please inform your friends and also call them,

475
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:06,160
because I am here only for tomorrow.

476
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:22,320
Those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze

477
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,320
will settle down tomorrow,

478
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,320
and those who have not felt at all will also feel it.

479
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,520
May God bless you all.

480
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,680
You see how it is, it's shaking.

481
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,480
Also tell them not to talk about it.

482
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,760
It is beyond your mind. To be quiet.

483
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,600
Don’t discuss it.
