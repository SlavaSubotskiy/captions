1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:15,200
Now it says, that all of you who are one in your spirit

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,720
this is all description of Sahaja Yoga today

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,640
is the future, the present that you will get it

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,880
at this time what is going to happen, it is so beautifully shown,

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
you will be surprised, that you all will become one in the universe

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,640
the spirit of the universe will be satisfied

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
with the yadnyas they are going to,

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,560
with the five ceremonies you are going to.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
How [inaudible] he said it three hundert years back.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,640
And then You should give us the milk of Your blessings,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,280
by getting the complete satisfaction from Us.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,400
That time all the horrible, evil people

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,520
will be ruined and their plan will be  spoiled

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,880
and people will take to righteousness.

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,560
This is the description they [inaudible]

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,160
and that time there will be a tremendous friendship

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,040
of the spirit among people.

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Those who are in ignorance will get light.

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,480
The whole universe will see the light,

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,560
the sun of one universal religion.

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,480
What ever you will desire, what ever they will desire,

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
they will get it.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,040
All the human beings.

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
Worshipp?

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,040
Then you will meet Us, there will be a shower of blessings

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,840
and of course of Chaitanya, then you will meet, that's Me, ah.

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,920
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,880
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

29
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,200
This is the description of Sahaja Yogis, what must be said today

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,880
that they will be the forrests

31
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,960
like [inaudible], means in many thousands

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,040
like moving forrests of huge trees,

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,000
of blessing giving, of giving blessings,

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,320
trees that gives blessings and can give -

35
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,320
Kalpataru is the tree that gives you whatever you want

36
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,600
and they will be like the moving forrests,

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,440
means all of you are like that, great

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,880
that you will be like the great trees,

39
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,120
like this trees are, great trees which are moving,

40
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,600
but which are bestowing blessings upon others,

41
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,200
giving them what they want, Kalpataru.

42
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,080
They will be now you people,

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,440
they will be the ocean or

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,000
talking, oceans of talking or bubbling

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,520
Amrutha, Amrutha is a nectar, the nectar of life.

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,000
You will be the oceans of the bubbling nectar

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,480
which are talking, like this ocean here.

48
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,880
See the trees and the ocean, the ocean that talks of,

49
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,360
in a way that it just ammits nectar,

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,640
the nectar of bliss, that's you people.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,080
Now the day will be like the moon witout any spots on it,

52
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,880
immaculate [inaudible] which has no spots, non colour on it,

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,240
colour [inaudible] on it, no blemish, without any blemish.

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Like the sun which have got, sun, the sun which is without any heat,

55
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,760
that is you, the sun.

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Now all such people who will be righteous,

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,520
who will stand for the right, for the truth

58
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,960
are going to be related to each other,

59
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,960
are going to be related in the whole world.

60
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,880
Now with this beginning - [Shri Mataji talks aside in Hindi]

61
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,720
With this beginning we understand

62
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,880
that the great saints of Maharashtra in that time,

63
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,800
the greatest was Ganeshwara,

64
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,680
because He saw the future that's going to come

65
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,040
and He told people about you,

66
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,960
that the man of God will become prophets

67
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,160
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

68
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,080
Now we do not realize what are we when we become Sahaja Yogis.

69
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,880
We become so much still worried about things which have no value.

70
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,920
If you see in the ultimate

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,040
all the things have no value, because they are so temporary

72
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,720
and if you go on wasting your energy

73
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,520
about things that have no spiritual value,

74
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,880
that doesn't matter, you are going to waste your life,

75
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,320
because now you are there what is described,

76
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,880
the oceans which are talking nectars, oceans of talking nectars,

77
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,920
nectar, not the nectar that we understand,

78
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,840
nectar of spiritual bliss.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,000
You are that and when you are that,

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,760
then what is expected of you about yourself, just find out.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,280
You just find out yourself reflect back

82
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,560
what is expected of me of myself?

83
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
What am I doing about it?

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,480
I am worried about this nonsense, that nonsense

85
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,920
and I am supposed to be the ocean of blissfull nectar.

86
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,920
I am supposed to be the forrest of the Kalpatarus,

87
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,720
the trees that give the boon to the people,

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,360
huge big trees and then what am I doing?

89
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,000
My giving-capacity is so low, what do I give up?

90
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,040
I don't even have attention

91
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,800
that can absorb the energy of the Divine.

92
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,960
The attention should be such

93
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,640
that I should be able to absorb the attention of the Divine.

94
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,000
Instead of that my attention is on wrong things.

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
And what am I doing?

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,960
What do I do about myself is that

97
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,400
I am not trying to manifest that special quallity,

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,040
the highest quallity, the one that I am.

99
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,840
I am born after it, I have been born so many times,

100
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,240
I have been a saint, I have been going arround seeking God

101
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I have been going arround and again when I am born in this life-time

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,280
for such a tremendous task again I am lost

103
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
with the same nonsense?

104
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
And still moving about with the same nonsense.

105
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
If you understand that

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,000
then you will know that what importance it has today

107
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,080
on this day of our international seminar.

108
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Internationally you are all related to each other and to nobody.

109
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,680
Internationally.

110
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,760
You are all relations to each other.

111
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,160
These are the relations which are relations of deep friendship.

112
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Friendship has no [inaudible], has no lust, no gread, nothing,

113
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,280
it's just friendship.

114
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,280
Pure relationship and we are that because we have left ...

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,320
What is the matter with you, Madame?

116
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,000
Will you please go and - that side!

117
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,960
This is not to be done, [inaudible], please sit down!

118
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,600
Hello, get out! This is not to be done when I am speaking.

119
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,240
What are you doing?

120
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,200
I just don't understand.

121
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,560
Am I talking just a odd which has any meaning or not

122
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,240
in your hearts or I am just talking without a meaning?

123
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,280
Sometimes I don't understand if I am talking to real Sahaja Yogis

124
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,880
or I am talking to some walls here

125
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,680
that who are not bothered about what I am talking.

126
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,400
Bring down to your attention

127
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,440
what am I saying. It is important.

128
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
Otherwise how are you going to learn?

129
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Where is your attention?

130
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,920
So it's all right to say that it is all love,

131
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,000
it's all affection, it's all goodness,

132
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
it's all very sweet thing, you see,

133
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
but you must know that you have to come up.

134
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,120
These trees have come up after a great struggle,

135
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,800
against the whole atmosphere, against the whole surroundings.

136
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
They have come up on their own,

137
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,000
except for the Mother Earth to [inaudible].

138
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,920
So you people must know that you all are here to come up,

139
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,360
to fight yourself, find out what's wrong with you.

140
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
What is your attention first of all?

141
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
The attention has to move in such a manner

142
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,720
that outward you grow

143
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,320
and inward you hold fast to your Mother.

144
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,720
With complete respect.

145
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
Those who cannot do it are absolutely useless.

146
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,400
If any tree doesn't try to hold fast this Mother Earth

147
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
it will fall out.

148
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,240
I mean it is just what it is doing and for which it is rewarded.

149
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
It's nothing to do with the Mother Earth.

150
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,520
The Mother Earth has this speciality.

151
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,400
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

152
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
This Mother Earth has this speciality

153
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,280
and if this Mother Earth

154
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,440
is not going to be linked by you, by your [inaudible].

155
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
Continious identification,

156
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,600
or you are going to fall out like a dead tree.

157
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,240
So it is very important to understand that you are great,

158
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,120
no doubt, these trees are great,

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,720
they are forced through, they have come up

160
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,680
but where is your attention and what are you here for?

161
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,000
What is needed to stick in,

162
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,280
sticking to things which are against your growth?

163
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,280
Bothered about things which go against you all the time?

164
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,200
The first and foremost thing that goes against us

165
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,480
is our own nonsensical ego.

166
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
You must understand this ego is the one,

167
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
is the greatest barriere within us

168
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
and we have to get out of it.

169
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,160
The Kundalini has to rise like the tree has this [inaudible].

170
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,360
And the ego is the biggest, biggest hurdle for most of it.

171
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,800
It appears in many ways,

172
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,200
we fight the Mother Earth which is giving you the source.

173
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,560
You are the very [inaudible] of that Mother.

174
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
She has created you, She has made you.

175
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,440
Because of Her you have come up. You are fighting Her

176
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,960
[inaudible] Her, going against ...

177
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,200
This is your ego, how will you grow?

178
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,040
And once you start growing the sun can help you.

179
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,000
The sky, everything can help you, the nature can help you,

180
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,440
but you must have complete desire to rise

181
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,160
about your dwarvness,

182
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,640
about your selfishness,

183
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,480
about your conditionings and especially your ego.

184
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,120
All this when we say that you are this,

185
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
there is no need to be puffed up,

186
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
you see, if I tell a little tree that you are going to be a big tree

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,520
it doesn't mean that it becomes a big tree.

188
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,640
One has to become the big tree by pushing forward

189
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,840
and that quallity like Ganeshvara, like Tucarama, like Ramdas

190
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,080
you all have to become that qualility.

191
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,920
They never saw Me, I just nurrished them, without [inaudible] Me,

192
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,160
but they nurrished theselves on their own virtues,

193
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,120
on their own qualilities, on their own greatness.

194
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,400
You have to be great like them.

195
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,560
Instead of that if you live with false emotions about yourself,

196
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:28,720
artificial things, absurd ideas,

197
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
all nonsense that we have gathered through our [inaudible],

198
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,080
through our rationality, through our reading, through our Gurus

199
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,200
and through our own mental projections

200
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,800
are going to be extremely dangerous

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
for the growth of every individual Sahaja Yogi

202
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,560
and as a whole also it will effect.

203
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,240
So we have to take a vow

204
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,720
that we are going to behave in a manner

205
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,920
which beholds our advent and [inaudible]

206
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,520
our advent at this time which is being described

207
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,000
and prophesized. Prophecy was made long time.

208
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:36,240
If we understand that we have come on this Earth for that purpose

209
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,600
we'll really separate ourselves from all the rest of the nonsense

210
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,720
that goes on and try to rise towards the sky

211
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,080
as these trees have done.

212
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,880
We should not follow any other Sahaja Yogi

213
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,680
in all anti-growth activities

214
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,680
and anyone who tries to create a kind of a group

215
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,280
or tries to impress you by saying

216
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
that he can teach you something higher, [inaudible]

217
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,960
all kinds of technices and this and that you have to do.

218
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,080
First of all you must know that Sahaja Yoga is a growth within

219
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,440
and that growth expresses itself outsides.

220
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,280
So that within growth is to be done by you fully,

221
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
with full understanding.

222
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,360
Then I don't have to tell you about anyone

223
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,960
You won't will be volnerable to nonsensecall talk and jabbering.

224
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,360
You have some people who are intellectuals.

225
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,920
Intellectuals have a bad habbit of intellectuallizing everything.

226
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,360
Intellegence is nothing for God, because God has created it.

227
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
So you have to see through that.

228
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
There are some people who are very emotional

229
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,120
and try to express themselves emotional.

230
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,360
You have to get out of those ideas

231
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,040
and you have to understand

232
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,600
that emotions can play a very dangerous role in life.

233
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,360
Now we  have decided to have so many marriages in Bordi,

234
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
which is a very nice thing and auspicious thing.

235
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
I am very happy about it,

236
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,400
that we are going to have so many marriages, it is auspicious,

237
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,680
because marriages are supported, blessed by God.

238
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,440
Yours is special, because I am sitting here before you,

239
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
for these marriages.

240
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,280
But don't make a fuzz out of the marriage.

241
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,640
Don't create a problem by becoming superficial about marriage.

242
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,600
These are the marriages of Brahma-Eka

243
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,640
where one feels the one-ness of the spirit

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,320
of the all-pervading power.

245
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,040
Try to know that these marriages are done among saints

246
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
and not among ordinary people.

247
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,880
Try to respect the inner quallity of a person.

248
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,160
If somebody is a Sahaja Yogi of high quallity that must be respected

249
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,680
and that must be done and not the outer quallities.

250
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,760
The outward quallities are nonsensically.

251
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,360
You must respect each other when you marry,

252
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,720
because you are all saints.

253
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,760
You are saints of very high quallity, I have told you

254
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,200
and the potential is so great, which is allready described

255
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,560
that only your assumption can get you that way.

256
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,040
The whole world is hoping to happen these things,

257
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,520
that they should get such people on this Earth,

258
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,080
so they are described.

259
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,320
The whole world is watching your progress,

260
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,120
the whole world is expecting this to happen,

261
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
the whole world has allready pronounced it

262
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
and where are we?

263
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,520
Where are we? Our progress is so slow.

264
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,600
We are worried about stupid things,

265
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,000
material things, worldly things,

266
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,480
superficial things, artificial things.

267
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,280
So one has to understand that you are here today

268
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,280
for this international seminar - promise Me.

269
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,480
Everybody seems to be younger than Me in this group,

270
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,480
but you have to promise that Mother we'll work with the same zeal,

271
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,520
with the same attention as You are

272
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,800
and try to settle ourselves

273
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
fight for yourselves within.

274
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,760
We talk to much, talk to much, do nothing.

275
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,720
Try to reserve your energy in that silent dignity.

276
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,600
You must have full  ideas to what you are.

277
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,360
You must understand, what have you been up to,

278
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,520
what have you done about it?

279
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,640
Talking, talking, talking -

280
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,360
that's not the way it is going to work out.

281
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,320
The atmosphere is nice, everything is fine,

282
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,800
the future seems very jubilant, everything is fine,

283
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,960
but the highest about everything is

284
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,120
the hope of your Mother

285
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
that you are going to emancipate the whole world.

286
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,480
Give attention to that!

287
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Think about it, that you are going to do that.

288
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,640
You have to be them, walking, talking, moving

289
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,280
forrests of that divine love, that dambara pragnya.

290
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,720
I hope you understand, today is a very important day,

291
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,360
I feel that if this holy session works out well

292
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,080
maybe we'll might achieve a lot next year.

293
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,320
Now so We have looked forward to a Puja today

294
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,040
and try to absorb.

295
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,880
My chakras worked very hard

296
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,120
and actually I find it sometimes impossible to accept the Puja.

297
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:09,080
Today is a Puja of a great day and a great time.

298
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,480
At this time a big resservoire has to be opened out,

299
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,440
but it is  to be channelized to people

300
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,200
and how can I channelize to people who are filled with vanity,

301
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,560
with stupidity or with small-mindedness?

302
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:43,280
We have to be large, huge, big-hearted, great people.

303
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,600
We are all born again who were great today again,

304
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,440
but somehow you are still mixed up with your surrounding.

305
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,800
So try to understand your own importance

306
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,120
and the importance of the time.

307
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,160
Is to worship yourself, to worship, but to be worshippable.

308
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,640
You all think that only by dressing up properly

309
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,800
or by pushing up any show like that

310
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,520
we become worshippable, but we do not.

311
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,160
We should be worshippable to ourselves,

312
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,520
to see that whatever we are doing it has that grace and beauty,

313
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,280
the love and the greatness

314
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,920
of the saints who are very great saints,

315
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,640
not ordinary but tremendous saints,

316
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,080
but it is been described actually

317
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,800
that Ganeshwara in this poem has really worshipped you.

318
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,960
I wish we had people like Ganeshwara,

319
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,480
but they are all inside My body.

320
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:01,000
You are all outside and whatever is said has to be fullfilled,

321
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,640
not only that, but whatever is said is the truth.

322
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,120
For all these Pujas you must have that depth, that greatness

323
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,840
of those great saints who came on this Earth

324
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,480
who worked for you, created this atmosphere,

325
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,400
think of them, what they have done,

326
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
they have fought, all the time, they were tortured,

327
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,840
they had none of these facilities as you have,

328
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,400
they had none of this enjoyment, nothing of that kind,

329
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,800
while you got it all, everything on the plate.

330
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,400
So be deserving people, authorized people

331
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,840
and work it out in that way.

332
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,200
Otherwise this world we cannot change.

333
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,880
This Puja has a very special significance upon you

334
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,280
and has to be done by people

335
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,200
who know that they are these great personalities.

336
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,400
It has nothing to do

337
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,120
with your so called artificial positions in life

338
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,200
or anything that is outside,

339
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,600
is the inside.

340
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,360
In this seminar one should not talk too much about outside-things,

341
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:28,280
but just talk about God, about your Mother or about Sahaja Yoga.

342
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,880
Best thing is to talk about your Mother,

343
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,520
so you neutralize it [inaudible]

344
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,320
and it works out, it works out.

345
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,440
It is a simple thing one has to understand

346
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,760
that God has been so kind to you, so kind.

347
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,840
You don't have to fight for your saintliness,

348
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,760
nothing, you are all brothers and sisters.

349
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,720
You are all here, so much close to them, you are not alone.

350
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,400
You are so great that you can know what you are.

351
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,720
Who told them, who looked after, who helped them?

352
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,600
Today you are just like V.I.P.s

353
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,520
So please try to understand

354
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,120
that you have to have a very humble attitude

355
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,240
towards all these saints and towards Sahaja Yoga.

356
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,160
Try to absorb as much as possible.

357
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,920
be kind to yourself.

358
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,240
May God bless you all.

359
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,800
Now today the problem is always there,

360
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,720
who is going to do the worship and worships Me.

361
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,600
I would say for today there should be no such choice

362
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,000
who is going to do it.

363
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,640
It can be just washed without anybody touching that water,

364
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
is the best idea.

365
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:51,240
Now all the girls who are going to get married, please come forward.

366
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,400
You have to cover your heads.

367
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:35,360
Cover your heads please, all those who are getting married.

368
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,360
You are entering into a married life

369
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,440
and you have been worthy so far

370
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:22,400
and now you have to enter into another life of marriage

371
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,040
and it is a great responsibility on all of you

372
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,920
to see that you make your marriages successfull.

373
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,560
It is your responsibility much more than that of your men

374
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,720
and you have to see that you behave in such a manner

375
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:46,760
that it creates a proper motherhood within yourself

376
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,480
and a disciplin that you want your children to imbibe

377
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,360
and your husband.

378
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,640
You have seen your motherhood [inaudible]

379
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:59,800
and we are sitting for nine to ten hours sometimes at one place

380
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,960
not even getting out of this place,

381
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:08,240
but I have seen people that they can't sit for two hours

382
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,120
and a place, even if they are meditating all this

383
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,800
and they'll get up, disturb everybody else and come down.

384
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,840
This is a sign that we lack in our discipline,

385
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,000
that our parentship did not [inaudible], that we did not discriminate.

386
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,560
So now first thing is that, you have to have a perfect discipline

387
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,080
of your temperament and that is a sign that you are the people

388
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,200
who represent this Mother Earth,

389
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,280
who has a special wisdom

390
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,240
and a special power to express depht.

391
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,320
So all of you have to be extremely carefull

392
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:52,280
that whatever you do will be reflected in the whole family

393
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:58,040
and in the whole Sahaja Yoga system.

394
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,320
Now when you get married to your husband

395
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,360
try to understand that you are the Mother Earth

396
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,080
and you have to give

397
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,080
and because you have powers to give

398
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,440
because you have so  many shaktis within you you have to give.

399
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,280
That means you are superior in a way, that you can give,

400
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,840
so that your ego should not stand up all the time and say,

401
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,760
why should I give, why should I?

402
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:23,240
And then you will start enjoying this womanhood.

403
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,840
So try to be good Mothers,

404
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,280
good wives and responsible Sahaja Yoginis.

405
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,720
Those who after marriage

406
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,640
try to deveate their husbands from Sahaja Yoga

407
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,760
are really most [inaudible: cursedly?].

408
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,280
You should have sweet tongue for others, be carefull what you talk.

409
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,800
You have to be responsible, you are special people

410
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,600
that you are married in Sahaja Yoga.

411
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,200
I hope you will keep this in your mind.

412
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,720
Now this time [inaudible] I  have to do this speech

413
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,200
but I'll ask somebody else to do it

414
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,840
but you should touch each other and do it [inaudible] in a symbole.

415
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,680
You all should touch each other, come forward!

416
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,600
Touch there and you will be really first.

417
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,960
You are first [inaudible].

418
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,200
You have to touch these feet.

419
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,640
Everybody must know that there have to be discipline.

420
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,440
And the body is not to be made work out in such a way

421
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,805
that it should dominate you.

422
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,480
At the time of meditation the body should be your slave, completely.

423
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:42,770
This is the, these are the virtues of a worship.

424
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:47,610
The power of worship, actually it works.

425
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:54,570
She is alone without Shiva, all these [inaudible] without Shiva.

426
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:25,370
[inaudible: Rupam?] means an auspicious personality,

427
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:29,010
means auspicious personality, [inaudible: rupam?].

428
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:38,010
Now the married women all done My [inaudible] go back

429
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:42,170
that the married women can go.

430
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:51,330
All married women should come here.

431
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:56,650
A married woman has many [inaudible] come infront!

432
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:10,130
Married in Sahaja Yoga,

433
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:13,410
those who are married in Sahaja Yoga.

434
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:27,170
All the ladies who are married in Sahaja Yoga.

435
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:42,290
That's all?

436
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:46,770
All those who got married in Sahaja Yoga allready.

437
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:15,490
All those who want to take photograph can come.

438
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:03,930
Now you can all go and sit down.

439
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:59,330
Now the thing is all Sahaja Yoga terminologie has integrated.

440
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:05,130
If you say "success" it means good reputation

441
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:08,330
that has come out of righteousness.

442
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:12,010
Anybody who has a success is not  a perfect fellow

443
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:13,690
who has [inaudible].

444
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:17,050
In Sanskrit-language it is said the other way round,

445
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,490
if you have got so far something,

446
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:20,650
supposing somebody who becomes a minister,

447
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:25,210
for all practical purposes he is supposed to be a person

448
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:28,570
who has got success in the english sense,

449
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:33,130
but in the Sanskrit-language the [inaudible: yesha?] means a person

450
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:37,570
who achieves something which gives him good reputation,

451
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:41,130
righteous reputation, reputation of virtue.

452
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:44,570
Such a person need not be a very wealthy man

453
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:48,650
need not be so successfull as a minister or a primeminister,

454
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:52,610
but a success that gives you great reputation.

455
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:55,770
and a success of the saints, the [inaudible: vidyesha?].

456
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:57,770
So one of [inaudible]

457
01:56:57,970 --> 01:57:00,290
that in Sahaja Yoga all the words, now rupa,

458
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:04,490
Rup can mean in a normal way is that just the goodness

459
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:07,530
but in Sahaja Yoga it [inaudible: do not mean the?] goodness.

460
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:13,850
It means the look or the appearence that is blissfull.

461
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,770
You see, that means blessing.

462
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:23,850
The faith that gives blessings and not negative.

463
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:32,410
So it's an integrated termonology, one word means many things.

464
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:40,010
People should not confuse because good looks

465
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:43,570
can be like a cinema-actress, that's not [inaudible: good look?].

466
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:46,730
Good look means "not glamorous", you see?

467
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:52,690
A look that is blissfull, auspicious.

468
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:19,330
This is the first bliss to show

469
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:24,450
that you ask something for your body from your Mother,

470
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:26,170
which attends humility

471
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:31,410
that oh Mother, please give me a morsel of food.

472
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:34,210
It is a sign of humility,

473
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:40,610
whatever Mother gives me will be the blissfull thing, it [inaudible] us.

474
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:44,290
Now the second part of it, worldly part.

475
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:19,370
You see, She gives me the bliss of Yoga,

476
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:25,210
the joy of Yoga and the joy of complete freedom. Mukta.

477
02:08:25,610 --> 02:08:28,410
[inaudible: Muktiir], complete divine.

478
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:31,170
The joy of Nirmal.

479
02:09:57,410 --> 02:10:00,010
Nira means the One that is been described,

480
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:03,090
so far the One who is being described.

481
02:10:03,450 --> 02:10:05,770
Like scriptures and things is Nira,

482
02:10:06,010 --> 02:10:08,810
which has come out of our minds and kept over.

483
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:12,850
So She is the One who makes us penetrate

484
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:16,050
into the meanings of this.

485
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:21,570
Whatever is manifested or expressed,

486
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:24,250
She is the One who makes us penetrate,

487
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:28,130
because She gives you that subtler attention.

488
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:33,690
She is the One who is the Om Kara,

489
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:39,170
which is the bija-akshara, is the main-syllable,

490
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:48,690
the One who opens the Mokshas door.

491
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:58,370
She is the One who should give me alms of realization.

492
02:10:58,570 --> 02:11:03,650
[inaudible] is all the way of saying something in a very humble way.

493
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:08,890
The humble way that gives Me the alms of realization.

494
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:15,690
Like a beggar would say that I beggar please give me realization,

495
02:11:15,930 --> 02:11:19,330
I am a beggar at your door.

496
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:36,410
This is the One who gives the prologue in a drama,

497
02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:40,690
is the One who holds the course in a show,

498
02:12:41,090 --> 02:12:43,290
where the [inaudible] are there,

499
02:12:43,530 --> 02:12:44,690
is called as the shukradara,

500
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:47,930
the One who is the holder of the thread.

501
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:53,250
She is the one who holds all the Shukras in Her hand,

502
02:12:53,490 --> 02:12:54,610
all the threads in Her hand

503
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:57,450
and just breakes us through all the drama.

504
02:12:57,650 --> 02:13:01,530
It's all Her own style, it's true, I agree.

505
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:35,610
She keeps and naturally, you see, if you don't give Him peace,

506
02:13:35,890 --> 02:13:40,250
He destroys the world, so keep Him pleased all the time.

507
02:13:40,610 --> 02:13:42,130
That's what the women must understand,

508
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:45,250
they must keep their husbands peace.

509
02:14:55,290 --> 02:14:58,650
Kashmira Tripureshwari means to be in Sahasrara.

510
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:02,570
The Himalayas are the Sahasrara and Kashmir is there.

511
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:05,170
So Kashmir, you see, is there.

512
02:15:05,370 --> 02:15:08,490
Tripura is because She killed the -

513
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:11,450
There are two meanings for Tripura,

514
02:15:11,650 --> 02:15:16,090
one is meaning that She killed that horrible demon called Tripura

515
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:19,410
and Tripura means "of the three worlds".

516
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:21,690
She is the beauty of the three worlds, Tripurasundari.

517
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:27,450
I mean the beauty is not to be confused, it should be integrated.

518
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:41,730
She opens the door of the heavens, because [inaudible].

519
02:15:51,170 --> 02:15:55,930
Niranan, it should be same thing like in English, the second birth.

520
02:16:29,490 --> 02:16:32,930
You are complete, [inaudible] when you are complete,

521
02:16:33,170 --> 02:16:37,090
because you see after Sahasrara you have to become perfect.

522
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:46,130
Victory, it gives victory, victory over ignorance

523
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:48,690
by giving realization.

524
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:56,330
