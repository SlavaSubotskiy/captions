1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,199
So I have to tell you, that you might be 
the highest of highest,

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,625
first thing [that] you have to give Me today 
is that in your talk,

3
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:22,335
in your behaviour, in your heart, 
you will reside one with Love.

4
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:26,952
And the second thing I want to ask is that 
you should be peaceful people.

5
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,684
Try to have peace with yourself. 
Don’t fight with yourself.

6
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:35,164
Now, the western people have one problem: 
they fight with themselves.

7
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,602
“How is it this is happening to me? 
I am so bad. I am no good.

8
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:40,333
I have done this. I am so bad.”

9
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:43,901
If you go on fighting with yourself, 
then you will become week.

10
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:47,087
On the contrary, you must say, 
“I am so good. What’s wrong with me?

11
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,601
I’ve got realization. 
What’s wrong with me?

12
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,364
Have that confidence in oneself, 
and then it will work out.

13
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,760
And as result of that only 
you start shouting at others.

14
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,170
But supposing you understand

15
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:01,347
that there is nothing wrong with you, 
you have to be peaceful.

16
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:04,532
We all have to be very peaceful people 
and you have seen,

17
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,687
My peaceful nature has solved 
so many problems just like that.

18
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:14,480
So try to achieve that peace within you. 
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

19
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,998
and should not be also expressed outside 
in a way, like I sometimes.

20
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:23,019
My peace itself becomes terrible.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,809
But you don’t have that kind of a possibility, 
so you just don’t do it.

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,663
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

23
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:35,524
Try to be extremely peaceful, 
try to make your forehead relaxed.

24
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:38,291
Many people come to Me 
with [face] like this, you see,

25
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:41,557
then I just know that there is 
a big bhoot on the head sitting;

26
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,738
then I shout at them.

27
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,728
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

28
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,596
“I am not doing anything, Mother is doing everything. 
Relax, relax, relax.”

29
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:56,334
If you relax, you’ll find 
that your heart will open.

30
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:59,902
“My heart cannot open.” 
Why, why can’t you open your heart?

31
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,517
Because you have no trust in yourself.

32
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,149
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya, 
open your Ekadasha

33
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,104
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will open. 
Once your Sahasrara is open,

34
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:18,366
your heart will open automatically, 
so you will have a peaceful life.

35
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,291
So today I am asking for two things from you.

36
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,728
It's a funny thing that a Mother 
has to ask for a gift.

37
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:29,267
And the gift you have to give - first one - 
is that you should be peaceful people.

38
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:34,470
You should express peacefulness 
through your own character, talking.

39
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:39,133
But it doesn't mean that you should be 
people who are bleak,

40
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:45,865
or who are - we can say that - 
are morbid people

41
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:50,527
or people who tolerate nonsense. 
No, there is a way of resistance.

42
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:54,526
But a resistance, of a peaceful resistance, 
that you are not afraid of anything;

43
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:58,148
you are not frightened of anything; 
you are not going to bow down to anything;

44
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,998
you are not going to compromise with anything, 
but you are peaceful.

45
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,783
That sort of a temperament you must develop

46
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,473
and also express outside, is very important.
