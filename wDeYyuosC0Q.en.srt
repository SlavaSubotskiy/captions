1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:33,000
we are here to inform you about a power

2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:36,059
which is within us and the power that

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,629
can give you what is promised by all the

4
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:44,610
saints scriptures and all the

5
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,400
incarnations today when you see the

6
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:55,140
young people in every country especially

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:01:01,220
in the West you'll find they are not

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:04,550
satisfied with their own atmosphere

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,550
their lives

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:19,340
and they think there is something

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,340
missing and they are extremely confused

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:32,070
now when they are confused they are

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:40,920
seeking for something beyond something

14
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:44,869
unknown to them in that seeking they may

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,869
take to anything extreme

16
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,500
drugs

17
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,760
could be alcoholism

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,560
or some other perversions which cause

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,560
horrible diseases incurable diseases

20
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:31,520
instead of condemning them we have to

21
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,210
see why they are doing all these things

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,210
what is the purpose

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,220
also some of them went to some gurus

24
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,370
which are in the market

25
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,769
especially when they see the religious

26
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:13,209
people and the religions they cannot

27
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:16,590
believe that religion can give such

28
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,590
horrid experiences

29
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:31,120
and some of them are anti-god

30
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,120
anti-religion also

31
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,520
but if you deal with the problem

32
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:49,150
sympathetically you cannot blame them

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,810
because they are intelligent aware

34
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,810
people

35
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:12,140
so now we have to category of people one

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,140
the ones who are not seeking at all

37
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:29,730
and another are the ones who want to

38
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,730
find out solutions of the problems

39
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:47,610
in every generation we had people who

40
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,580
revolutionized because they did not like

41
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,490
a particular system or did not like a

42
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,490
particular style of life whatever it was

43
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:07,400
but now the revolution has to come from

44
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:07,400
within we have to evolve from within

45
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,010
because the destruction is also coming

46
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:30,390
from within we are destroying ourselves

47
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:34,880
more from within because we are so

48
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,880
unhappy so confused

49
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:47,180
absolutely quite a percentage is peace

50
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:53,400
or anything so then we start seeking

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:56,060
this solution and in that seeking we

52
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,060
make mistakes

53
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:11,640
and we make mistakes because we do not

54
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,640
know what to seek

55
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,450
and how to find

56
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,520
also how to evolve to that state

57
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:45,850
so logically we have to reach some

58
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:51,220
conclusions logically that it has to be

59
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:55,390
some evolutionary happening this is

60
00:06:51,220 --> 00:07:00,070
logical to transform ourselves there has

61
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:04,830
to be some evolution so like you have

62
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:07,060
said that you have to become

63
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,070
collectively conscious you have to

64
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,310
become it's an actualization it is not

65
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,370
just a certificate it has to be come

66
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,250
from within it's an honest thing it's an

67
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,490
innate thing it is not just a preaching

68
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:26,860
or sort of a giving a certificate it is

69
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:34,120
not or taking a name it is actually a

70
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:41,500
ssin within yourself so that something

71
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:44,830
has to happen to us now as we have

72
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:50,080
evolved from monkey stage to this stage

73
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:52,650
for example we've done nothing it is a

74
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,650
living process

75
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,550
which has taken place spontaneously

76
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:29,350
there's a big resistance to any oriental

77
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:32,529
ideas being accepted in the West weak

78
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:41,680
resistance I find it's a very big

79
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:44,339
resistance for any oriental ideas coming

80
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,339
to the West

81
00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,660
now these oriental ideas which are

82
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:03,560
coming are to be seen with a scientific

83
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,560
open mind

84
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:18,220
because

85
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:25,080
the Western life has grown like a tree

86
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:25,080
outside but the roots may be in the East

87
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,850
maybe we can keep ourselves open to see

88
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,850
where are the roots

89
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,690
now if the roots are in the East

90
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,480
supposing it's an hypothesis so let us

91
00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:01,480
have a look at it if there is any

92
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:07,470
solution in those so you go to oriental

93
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:10,900
I guess but there also is very dangerous

94
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,870
because you are going in the unknown you

95
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:20,350
might go to false gurus you might go to

96
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:26,800
wrong people and get completely

97
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:29,590
destroyed so what do we do first thing

98
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,580
we should know we cannot pay for our

99
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:35,820
evolution we cannot pay money is not

100
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,820
there

101
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:57,180
nor can we pray for any living process

102
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:59,940
any living process we cannot be like if

103
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,100
the seat has to sprout the mother earth

104
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:08,310
is sprouted we don't pray the mother

105
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:10,740
earth all right so first thing they

106
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:17,040
should have known that anybody who asks

107
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:22,110
for money is not a truthful person no

108
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:26,910
money should be more then the second

109
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:34,800
point comes in that we got to this stage

110
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:37,970
of human awareness spontaneously without

111
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,970
any effort effortlessly

112
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,750
in the same way it should happen

113
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:59,059
but first of all in every evolution

114
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,059
there has been one leader

115
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,960
we can call them as archetypes as they

116
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,670
say or whatever you may say want to say

117
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,670
so you was not very clear on that point

118
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:32,180
so now such a person can decode the

119
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:36,900
information of symbols and everything

120
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:41,300
and can help others without taking any

121
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,300
money without taking any gratification

122
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:52,710
can do it and here it is that people

123
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:55,860
fumble in the West they don't mind a

124
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:59,490
pope they don't mind an archbishop of

125
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,010
canterbury but they do mind a person who

126
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,490
is doing everything free just out of

127
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,490
love

128
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,430
you'd be amazed in England the

129
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,410
television people told me that we cannot

130
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:25,930
accept anything which does not take

131
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:29,470
money can you believe it is a fact in I

132
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:32,230
think in Boston or somewhere they asked

133
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:39,160
me a question how many Rolls Royces you

134
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:41,830
have got this is a chance at least then

135
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,870
the most important thing which is not

136
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:51,760
realized by modern mind that they

137
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:55,020
believe anything new is to be tried is a

138
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,020
very dangerous thing

139
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:17,350
if we are dealing with the living

140
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,350
process of evolution we have to know

141
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,780
that

142
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,280
in spiritual life whatever is going to

143
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:32,020
happen must relate to scriptures to all

144
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,020
the Scriptures must relate to

145
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:56,420
not to one scripture say for Holy Bible

146
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,420
or Holy Quran or any but to all of them

147
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:08,699
because it is like a seed that sprouts

148
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:13,709
and it becomes the stem then the

149
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:18,209
branches then the leaves then the flower

150
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:21,749
and then the fruit living process it is

151
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:24,629
based on something evolves through

152
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:26,910
something but whatever is dead like we

153
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,300
can create a fruit plastic fruit from

154
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:33,379
nowhere just like that you see so which

155
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,379
has no basis

156
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:45,350
has no meaning it must have a basis from

157
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,650
where it has come its origin must be

158
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,650
seen

159
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:09,379
as in the growth of the tree all that is

160
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,959
useless drops out in the same way in

161
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:14,389
evolution also all that is useless drops

162
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,660
are even useless tradition drop out

163
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:20,569
everything drops out but ultimately you

164
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,899
reach to the epitome where you become

165
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:22,899
the fruit

166
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:36,800
so the time has come for human beings to

167
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:42,930
become the spirit so every seed has

168
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:47,540
Kamri all right and the same way within

169
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,540
us is our Camry is the Kundalini

170
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,860
and this is to be actually awakened

171
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:11,350
actually awakened now in sahaja yoga we

172
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:14,410
have thousands of people all over the

173
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:16,240
world there are people who are we can

174
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,750
call them the highest in the society

175
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:25,150
there are people who are the lowest in

176
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:28,720
the so-called society all of them are at

177
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:36,340
par with each and every person there is

178
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:40,120
no higher lower feeling everyone belongs

179
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:49,710
to that society so it belongs to that

180
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:54,250
society moreover when this happens

181
00:17:49,710 --> 00:18:00,460
because we understand what these

182
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:02,860
incarnations where the conflict of all

183
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,660
religions drops out like that we

184
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,900
understand it on central nervous system

185
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,550
the conflict drops out there is no

186
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:16,440
question of not worshipping Christ

187
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:20,140
Muslims Jews Hindus all worship Christ

188
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:24,870
they all worship Muhammad SAW and they

189
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:28,870
all worship Rama Krishna Odyssey because

190
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,970
