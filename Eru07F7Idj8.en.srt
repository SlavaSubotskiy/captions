1
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,480
Today we have gathered here

2
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,520
to worship Shri Krishna.

3
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,880
We must understand the significance

4
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,000
of Shri Krishna's advent

5
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,760
on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

6
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,640
As you know very well, except for once or twice,

7
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,360
Shri Brahmadeva has taken his incarnation.

8
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:44,120
Also once Shri Ganesha has taken His birth

9
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,520
as Lord Jesus Christ.

10
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,200
But Vishnu Tattwa, the principle of Vishnu,

11
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,520
has taken many a times birth on this earth,

12
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,040
as the Goddess had to take many a times Her birth.

13
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,600
They had to work together many a times,

14
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,960
and with the principle of Vishnu,

15
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,560
the principle of Mahalakshmi has acted

16
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,960
to help the ascent of the people.

17
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:32,440
So the principle of Vishnu is for your ascent,

18
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,040
for the evolutionary process of human beings.

19
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,520
Through this advent

20
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,680
and through the power of Mahalakshmi,

21
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:56,360
we have become human beings from amoeba stage.

22
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,760
This is a spontaneous working for us

23
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,080
but for the principle of Vishnu,

24
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,800
He had to go through various incarnations to evolve.

25
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,760
As you know there have been incarnations

26
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,480
of Shri Vishnu as a fish to begin with

27
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:36,240
and went on till it came to the state of Shri Krishna,

28
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,640
where they say that He has become complete.

29
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,400
But one has to realize that

30
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,200
He works on our central nervous system,

31
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,840
He builds our central nervous system.

32
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,240
Through our evolutionary process,

33
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,680
our central nervous system has been built up,

34
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,080
and this central nervous system has given us

35
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,800
all the human awareness that we have;

36
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,640
otherwise we would have been just like the stones.

37
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,520
But through this building up of our awareness,

38
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,280
one after another,

39
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,200
building up different chakras within us,

40
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,440
this principle of Vishnu has brought us to the understanding

41
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,160
that we have to seek the truth

42
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
and ultimately we have to become Sahaja Yogis.

43
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
So this principle of Shri Krishna

44
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,440
is so important that at the state,

45
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

46
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
we become complete,

47
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,480
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

48
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,720
and you start feeling the vibrations,

49
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,400
you are not yet fully complete.

50
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,280
If you were just complete then it would have been

51
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,120
an end of your evolution,

52
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,640
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

53
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,360
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

55
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

56
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,720
that means to your collective.

57
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,600
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

58
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,120
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

59
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,040
you cannot feel the vibrations.

60
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
As you saw yesterday,

61
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,400
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

62
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,880
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

63
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,200
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

64
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,040
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

65
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

66
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,840
their hands could not have moved that fast,

67
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
they would have never felt the sweetness,

68
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

69
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,160
and they would not have manifested it.

70
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,880
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

71
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,200
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

72
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,000
the sweetness.

73
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,480
In your art, in your music,

74
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,640
in your gestures,

75
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,640
in every way, your hands are very important.

76
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,040
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

77
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,840
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

78
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,240
which look after our face,

79
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,120
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

80
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,000
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

81
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,360
As a result also, you can become great actors,

82
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,320
you can have eyes which are innocent,

83
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,840
you can have a skin which is shining,

84
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,560
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

85
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,760
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

86
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:33,840
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

87
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
If you are a very harsh person

88
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,840
and a hot-tempered person

89
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
and you have harshness on your face,

90
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,280
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

91
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,280
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

92
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,360
your face looks so miserable,

93
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,320
everything changes and comes into the center,

94
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,280
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

95
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,560
in the Divine way, and also you get

96
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,120
a very sweet countenance.

97
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,960
Also the teeth and the tongue

98
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,840
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

99
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,920
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

100
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
You sometimes, as I told you

101
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

102
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,960
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

103
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,280
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

104
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,520
Then also your tongue improves.

105
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

106
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,720
They cannot say something sweetly,

107
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,400
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

108
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,560
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

109
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,840
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

110
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

111
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,600
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

112
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

113
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,880
Some people even stammer,

114
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,280
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

115
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
All these things drop out

116
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,240
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

117
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,680
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

118
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,760
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

119
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,040
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

120
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,040
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

121
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,240
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

122
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,600
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

123
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,040
you just start watching it,

124
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,200
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

125
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,000
and you do not get disturbed.

126
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,600
That seeing, that witnessing state

127
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,120
has a tremendous power.

128
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Whatever you see without thinking,

129
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,320
your problems get solved.

130
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,000
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

131
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,840
- what you call 'tatasth'-

132
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,360
means you are standing on the shores

133
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,200
and so watching the waves to move -

134
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,000
then you know how to solve the problems.

135
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,960
So your witness state has to be developed

136
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,680
and sometimes I have seen,

137
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,200
people have to go through little difficulties

138
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,680
to develop that witness state.

139
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,520
This is very important that once the Kundalini starts

140
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,840
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward,

141
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,760
moving on your chakras

142
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,480
and enriching your different chakras,

143
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,280
on the Vishuddhi chakra

144
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,560
when it has to stay, it really tries to

145
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,720
little bit take you through turmoils

146
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,400
and you start thinking that, "See now, my life was so blissful.

147
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,960
I had so many blessings and now what has happened?"

148
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,000
But this is the time when you should become tatastha,

149
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,040
means you should become a witness.

150
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,280
If you become a witness everything improves.

151
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,320
For example you are say a person who is working in some place.

152
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,800
As soon as you become a witness, you see,

153
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,040
your attention goes inside

154
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,840
and you start watching things from inside out.

155
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,600
As a result you see exactly what's wrong, where,

156
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,320
and as you have got the power of witnessing,

157
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,920
with that power you get over the problems that you have.

158
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,800
Problems get solved very easily

159
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
if you know how to witness the whole situation

160
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,040
than to get involved into it.

161
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,840
And this is the best state which you call as Sakshiswarupatva,

162
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,480
which you achieve when the Kundalini comes up

163
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,960
and the connection is established

164
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,920
and the Divine ray starts flowing through that

165
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,120
and enriches your Vishuddhi chakra.

166
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Now the name of Shri Krishna has come from the word 'krishi'

167
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,840
meaning 'the ploughing',

168
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,480
'ploughing' of the soil

169
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,360
for planting the crops.

170
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,840
Now He is the one who has done the ploughing for us,

171
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,880
in the sense that He has created us in such a manner

172
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,080
that when the sprouting has to be done

173
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
you are already ready for it.

174
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,000
But as it is we human beings spoil our Vishuddhi chakra

175
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
by many wrong things, as you have seen that

176
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,200
we smoke or we take drugs,

177
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,760
or we take tobaccos and all that.

178
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,120
So our Vishuddhi chakra goes out.

179
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,920
On top of that, if you are a person who doesn't talk at all

180
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,200
or who talks too much or who shouts and screams

181
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,040
and who shows temper, raises his voices,

182
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,640
also spoils his Vishuddhi chakra.

183
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,560
So the first thing is that in your

184
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,440
using the Vishuddhi chakra, you have to remember

185
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,080
it is to be used for sweetness, for madhurya.

186
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,440
If you want to say something to someone,

187
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,560
try to say something that is sweet and nice,

188
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,280
practice it.

189
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
In certain places I have seen

190
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,560
that people are used to a kind of a talk

191
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
and sometimes they cannot talk in the fashion that is sweet.

192
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,760
For them it is adharma as if to talk sweetly to someone.

193
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,880
They only believe that you must really talk in a manner

194
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
that will hurt others.

195
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,800
So hurting anybody is not in the dharma of Shri Krishna.

196
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,960
He either killed somebody

197
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
or He was sweet, there's nothing in between.

198
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,920
Either you have to be sweet to people

199
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,080
or you have to kill someone.

200
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
Now killing part you leave it.

201
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,000
So you have to be only sweet.

202
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,320
You all have to be sweet to each other,

203
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,000
specially among Sahaja Yogis

204
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,680
you have to be extremely sweet to each other.

205
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,840
And dealing with others also sweetly you have to tell

206
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,360
them if you find anything wrong with them that,

207
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,840
"See, this is not good. You are now come to Sahaja Yoga.

208
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Now you must behave like this or behave like that."

209
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,360
Now Shri Krishna's life has another very

210
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,960
significant role to play,

211
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,560
that is He came on this earth after Shri Rama's advent,

212
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,440
who was also Shri Vishnu.

213
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,240
When Shri Rama came the people were very ignorant,

214
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,200
they had no idea about dharma.

215
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
So as a king He wanted to teach them dharma

216
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,000
and so He had to become very serious.

217
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
So His incarnation was something

218
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,120
of a very serious father who is

219
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,000
very seriously undergoing all kinds of turmoils and things

220
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,760
and to create an image of a benevolent king.

221
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,760
As a result when He, His incarnation was over,

222
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,560
people became very serious-minded

223
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,440
and all the seriousness started in the religion,

224
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,160
all the ritualism started;

225
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
people became extremely rigid

226
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,920
and that rigidity killed all the joy of life

227
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,920
and then all kinds of other things also

228
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,280
started with that rigidity, is the beginning of Brahmanism.

229
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,960
Brahmanism started in India when people started

230
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,080
using Brahmanism as a birthright

231
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,760
while it is not a birthright of anyone

232
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,280
to be a Brahmin but you have to become a Brahmin.

233
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,880
After Realization you become a Brahmin,

234
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
this fact is established not only

235
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,360
in Shri Krishna's time, but also in Shri Rama's time

236
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,360
because Shri Rama Himself was not a Brahmin.

237
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,760
He made a person to write His Ramayana,

238
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,800
who was Valmiki, who was a shidul caste

239
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,880
and was a fisherman.

240
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,680
Very surprising, He asked this fisherman

241
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,000
to write His Ramayana when he was not a Brahmin,

242
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,760
and He made him a Brahmin

243
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,080
in the sense as you have become Brahmins means knowing the Brahma.

244
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
Those who know the Brahma are the Brahmins

245
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
and not those who are born in the Brahmin caste are Brahmins.

246
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,520
And that is why people sometimes get very upset

247
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,240
that how can these be Brahmins if they are so perverse

248
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
and they can commit all kinds of sins.

249
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,240
So by following any such religion or any such rigid ideas

250
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,600
you cannot improve.

251
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,720
If you call yourself a Christian

252
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,880
then one thing has to be seen in a Christian

253
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,320
that you cannot have adulterous eyes.

254
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,400
Now I would like to know how many Christians can claim that.

255
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
If they have no adulterous eyes about, say, women,

256
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,040
they'll have adulterous eyes about things.

257
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,000
So you cannot say that, by becoming Christians,

258
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,640
we have become really Christians;

259
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,040
in the same way we can say about Hindus.

260
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,560
In the Hindu religion, Krishna has said

261
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,840
that the Atma resides in everyone.

262
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:56,120
He never said that the birth determines your jati, your caste.

263
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,480
But among Hindus we believe

264
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,400
that everybody has a jati

265
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,304
and that everybody is a separate thing;

266
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:06,360
some people are to be treated as low, some as high.

267
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,160
This is just the opposite what Shri Krishna has preached,

268
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,400
because He said in everybody there is Atma.

269
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,160
And now in Sahaja Yoga we have proved

270
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,410
that whatever religion you may follow,

271
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,130
whatever things you follow, ideas or philosophy,

272
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,610
whatever you may follow, you all can become realized souls;

273
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,090
so nobody is higher, nobody is lower.

274
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,554
Is the best thing is to believe

275
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:31,410
that all others are wrong and we are correct.

276
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,810
But all of those people who believe like this

277
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,530
may have to go to hell directly,

278
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,530
because they have not reached the truth.

279
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,730
The truth is you have to become a realized soul,

280
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,890
and if you are not a realized soul

281
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,890
you are nowhere near God.

282
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,610
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

283
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,690
Christ himself has said that,

284
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,690
"You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

285
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,050
You are to be born again.

286
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,130
And when you'll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ',

287
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,530
I won't recognize you."

288
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,490
Openly He has said it, He has warned you.

289
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,130
Same about Mohamed Sahib Himself has said

290
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,530
"When the time of Qayama, the resurrection, will come,

291
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,450
your hands will speak".

292
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,450
And He has also said very clearly,

293
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,020
"Till the Qayama you do all these things,

294
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,020
like, you see, (rosaiya ?) and all that.

295
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:22,466
But when the Qayama comes, when you get your resurrection

296
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,140
then you don't have to do it." Clearly He said it.

297
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,940
But nobody is trying to find out the Qayama,

298
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,420
only they're trying to find faults with this or that

299
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,420
and fight with each other.

300
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,300
Now this Resurrection time He has already mentioned,

301
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,200
"When your hands will speak", is in Sahaja Yoga.

302
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,160
So after this you don't have to do anything.

303
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,400
Now you have become a Pir according to Him.

304
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,040
Once you have become a wali

305
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,640
you don't have to do all these things and you become dharmatit.

306
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,160
Is said also in Indian philosophy by Shri Krishna that,

307
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,560
"You become dharmatit, you go beyond religion",

308
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,520
means religion becomes part and parcel of you.

309
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,840
You don't have to have outside religions

310
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,440
which are of no use. Is clearly said.

311
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,310
 And Shri Krishna has said it as clearly as anybody could say it,

312
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,230
very, very clearly, that you have to go beyond your gunas,

313
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,750
beyond your dharmas,

314
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,390
that means you have to become a person who is religious

315
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,455
innately

316
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,620
and not to become a person

317
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,260
who is just outwardly something like Christian, Hindu, Muslim. No.

318
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,190
Inside, inside you have to become.

319
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,510
Now as a result of that you have seen what Shri Krishna has said

320
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,070
that, "Once you become from inside then I don't have to tell you,

321
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,590
'Don't drink, don't do this, don't do that, nothing'."

322
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,750
You just don't do it.

323
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,790
You just don't do it and you understand it so well

324
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,470
that this should not be done, that should not be done.

325
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,340
To overcome all kinds of nonsense of religion

326
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,256
Shri Krishna's advent was there.

327
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:17,576
Is a very important advent but I don't know

328
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,130
how many people understand that.

329
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,650
He came to show that it's all Leela,

330
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,650
is all the play of God.

331
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,650
What is there to be serious?

332
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,880
What is there to be ritualistic?

333
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,560
You cannot bind God in any rituals.

334
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,160
That's why He came on this Earth, to tell you

335
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,560
that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals

336
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,480
which are nonsensical.

337
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,880
This was His teaching so many years back.

338
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,680
He taught this six thousand years back but still,

339
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,760
if you see in every religion there are so many rituals going on.

340
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,680
So when the incarnations died, people started rituals,

341
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
funny stuff. Even when Shri Krishna died,

342
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,280
they didn't know what to do. Now because He said,

343
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,360
"No more rituals, just play Holi, be happy, joyous,

344
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,440
dance and sing", that's what He said,

345
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,600
now what to do now if He has said so?

346
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,190
So they started a new thing,

347
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,310
"Let us make it a romantic stuff."

348
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,130
Human beings know how to make everything perverse;

349
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,410
nobody can beat them in this.

350
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,250
So they made Him look like a very romantic personality,

351
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,970
romancing with Radha.

352
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,560
Radha, 'Ra' is energy, 'Dha' is the one who has sustained energy.

353
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,580
So show romances with Her when She was Mahalakshmi Herself,

354
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,780
to show His relationship with Mahalakshmi

355
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,660
as if They were Husband and Wife.

356
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,660
So there were also some poets who started describing them

357
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,840
as husband and wife, and all kinds of nonsense.

358
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,480
In Divine relationship there is nothing like husband and wife;

359
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,900
is the power which is potential, and power that is kinetic.

360
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,620
There is no such relationship that exists

361
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,660
as human beings try to make it,

362
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,850
because human beings have a habit

363
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,050
to bring all the Divine Incarnations to their own levels.

364
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,010
As you have seen that, if you see,

365
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,730
the best are the Greeks,

366
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,520
who brought all the great Incarnations to their own levels.

367
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
In the same way they could not do much with Shri Krishna

368
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,680
so they said, "All right, make him a romantic personality

369
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,170
that will suit us."

370
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,210
So it suited many horrible people.

371
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:34,010
We had one Nawab in Lucknow who had 365 wives

372
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,270
and he used to dress up like Shri Krishna,

373
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,510
sometimes like Radha, and dance

374
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,890
and he said, "Now I have become Shri Krishna."

375
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,050
So, so many, you know, gurus came as Shri Krishna playing flute,

376
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,090
becoming, calling everybody else as their gopis

377
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,090
and this and that. All nonsense.

378
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,090
And we have so many groups now working like that,

379
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,650
Brahma Kumaris and all that.

380
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,690
When there is one Krishna, the rest are all gopis and gopas

381
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,760
and they don't marry and all kinds of nonsense.

382
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,160
This is absolutely absurd and perverse

383
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,120
and brings bad name to Shri Krishna.

384
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,120
Shri Krishna was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara,

385
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,320
He was so detached that once His wives,

386
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
who were His powers, and they said that,

387
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,690
"We want to go across and worship a particular saint."

388
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,250
He said, "All right, why don't you go?" They said," No,

389
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,590
the river is in spate and we don't know how to cross the river."

390
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,710
He said, "All right, you go and tell the river that

391
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,990
we want to go and see such and such saint

392
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,740
and Shri Krishna has said that you come down.

393
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,460
If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara

394
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,540
and if He has had no wife then you go down."

395
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,700
So they went to the river and said that

396
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,580
"If Shri Krishna has had no wives

397
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,820
and He is a Yogeshwara then please go down".

398
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,758
The river went down. They were surprised,

399
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,840
that He is supposed to be our husband

400
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,240
and still He is Yogeshwara. He is so detached.

401
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,480
They crossed over and they went and worshipped the saint.

402
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,380
So the saint said, "Now you can go back."

403
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,740
When they were coming back, they found again the river was in spate.

404
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,980
So they went back to the saint and they said,

405
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,900
"Now how do we go back?"

406
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,420
He said, "How did you come?"

407
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,140
They said, "Shri Krishna said that, 'You go and ask the river

408
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,310
if I was a Yogeshwara, then you go down'."

409
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,830
"All right, so you go and ask the river

410
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,670
that the saint did not eat anything whatsoever

411
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,070
and he was absolutely detached about it,

412
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,550
so the river will go down."

413
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,510
So they were surprised because they had fed him,

414
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,050
he had ate everything, he had done everything.

415
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,450
So they went to the river and said, "Oh river,

416
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,690
the saint never ate anything,

417
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,770
he was absolutely detached about food,

418
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,800
he did not touch the food," And the river went down.

419
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,080
So they were surprised, how is it that the saint ate everything

420
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,760
and did not eat anything?

421
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,630
Means he was in aswadha, he was not

422
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,990
involved into the food, he was detached

423
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,990
and they were surprised. Looks like,

424
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,680
It looks like a lie from a, see, human point of view, it is not.

425
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,560
It is not, that's a fact.

426
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,600
He is a Yogeshwara and He is so detached.

427
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,600
So people don't understand Divinity and they think that

428
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,700
how can it be a person who has 16,000 wives

429
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,500
and five other wives can be a person who is not yet married?

430
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,450
Because He was Yogeshwara.

431
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,170
And that is what you all have to be, Yogeshwara.

432
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,530
You are married, you have got children.

433
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,130
I'm happy you are married because that's an auspicious thing to do,

434
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,290
to marry to begin with.

435
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,810
But you should not get involved with your family,

436
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,270
"My child, my family."

437
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,950
Many people I have seen, they come to Sahaja Yoga,

438
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,010
get married and get lost;

439
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,930
because to them, "Married now, I'm enjoying my family now,

440
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,470
looking after my family."

441
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,710
Our family is the whole universe,

442
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,990
it is not just my own wife and my children

443
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,170
but the whole Universe is our family.

444
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,650
And this is what Shri Krishna tried to show in His life

445
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,610
that the whole Universe is your family.

446
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,760
You are a universal being.

447
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,400
This is what He preached throughout,

448
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,660
that you are a universal being

449
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,390
and you have to be a part and parcel of the whole.

450
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,110
You are the part and parcel of the whole,

451
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,870
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

452
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,390
and this is not a lecture but has to happen within yourself

453
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,990
that you have to develop your collective consciousness.

454
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,050
And this is the gift of Shri Krishna,

455
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,250
because at the brain He becomes the Virata.

456
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,990
So now we have three identities within ourselves.

457
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,790
On the heart is Shiva,

458
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,870
in the brain is Shri Krishna, the Virata,

459
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,110
and in the liver, Brahmadeva.

460
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,350
So we have three identities

461
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,630
and in the stomach, in the Void as you say,

462
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,750
are all the Guru Tattwa where all the great Gurus

463
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,410
from Adi Nath, Mohamed Sahib

464
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,310
and others up to, we can say, Shirdi Sai Nath;

465
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,710
all of them are the Guru principle which we worshipped last time

466
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:39,243
when we were in Andorra.

467
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,510
So how they are all related with each other,

468
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,870
how they have worked out together

469
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,600
and brought you to the state of this witness is very important.

470
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,970
Now your Vishuddhi chakra has to be improved.

471
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,810
First of all, this feeling guilty business

472
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,330
was so much yesterday that, I tell you,

473
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,510
it was impossible to pull it out.

474
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,710
There's nothing to feel guilty, it's a fashion,

475
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,750
just a fashion, "I'm sorry" morning till evening "I'm sorry,

476
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,050
I'm sorry," What are you sorry for, for being a human being

477
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,970
or for a Sahaja Yogi?

478
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:20,550
So one has to be very pleasant towards oneself also.

479
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,310
All the time, "I'm sorry, I should not have done this,

480
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,110
I should not have done that", all the time feeling sorry

481
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,410
and feeling guilty spoils your left Vishuddhi.

482
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,290
As your left Vishuddhi is spoilt

483
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,050
what happens is that your Shri Krishna Tattwa is gone.

484
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,200
Then you cannot feel the collective,

485
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,280
then you cannot understand what has gone wrong with you.

486
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,920
So just if you have to say sorry also, say sorry to God

487
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,320
and after that don't say sorry anymore.

488
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,320
You face it.

489
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Whatever you have done wrong, all right face it!

490
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,160
This was wrong, all right it will not be done.

491
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,720
Do not argue with it, do not continue with it,

492
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,480
just face it and say, "This was wrong, and this wrong

493
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,720
I will not do again." And it's finished.

494
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,310
For you are after all saints now.

495
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,550
You have become now walis, you have become now realized souls,

496
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,650
you have become now atmajas.

497
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,370
You have got Brahmachaitanya,

498
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,730
you have seen on your heads there was light,

499
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,450
you have seen the proof of it.

500
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,570
So I don't have to give you a second certificate.

501
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,730
Only thing, you better understand and be aware

502
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,210
of your own position. As Shri Krishna has said,

503
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,250
"You have to be aware of your Self."

504
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,130
First to get self-realization

505
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,750
and then to be aware of your position.

506
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,870
Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper

507
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:50,740
attention, and proper understanding.

508
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,460
  Absolutely it is a easy thing to do

509
00:35:53,660 --> 00:36:01,700
as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state.

510
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,170
So please try to make yourself a witness.

511
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,640
When you see something, go into thoughtless awareness

512
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,480
that is your fort. Don't think.

513
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,880
See the beauty that is there, just pouring in.

514
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,880
Just watch

515
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,160
how these trees are standing still just watching you all.

516
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
See absolutely still, nothing is moving,

517
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,370
they don't allow even one leaf to move.

518
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,010
Let it be till the breeze starts.

519
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,530
Mother starts the breeze.

520
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,730
Till we'll just keep quiet and watch.

521
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,810
Like these mountains how they are steadily watching everything

522
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,970
and emitting joy and beauty.

523
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,970
In the same way, we have to become a witness.

524
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,720
We need not talk too much, we need not keep quiet

525
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,560
but in the center we should witness

526
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,880
the whole thing as Leela.

527
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,510
That's why He is called as Leeladhara,

528
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,110
means the one who sustains the Leela of a person.

529
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,990
It doesn't make you mad, it doesn't make you funny,

530
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,550
but it makes you joyous.

531
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,750
Anything that makes you joyous

532
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,970
is the Vishnu principle of Shri Krishna.

533
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,790
I hope all of us are going to enjoy

534
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,270
our Vishnu principle hereafter

535
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,950
as we have enjoyed before by meditating.

536
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,670
Because when we meditate we go into thoughtless awareness.

537
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,940
When we are in thoughtless awareness,

538
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,060
then only we grow, otherwise we cannot grow.

539
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Whatever we may try we cannot grow.

540
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,360
Unless and until we meditate

541
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,080
we cannot become thoughtlessly aware.

542
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,800
All those who also want to gain in any walk of life,

543
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,530
in any dimension, those who want to become say,

544
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,790
great artists, great scientists, great anything,

545
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,910
in Sahaja Yoga is important you must meditate,

546
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,790
otherwise the Kundalini will come down

547
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,670
and you lose all your talents.

548
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,450
That's a fact, which has to be told,

549
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,250
and you have seen how people got transformed.

550
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,970
But sometimes it can be very temporary

551
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,520
and it may go down

552
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,440
if people do not take to it in the proper way.

553
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,760
I wish you all very great luck for your witness state.

554
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,120
In the witness state,

555
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,630
we do not anyway express ourselves in a funny manner

556
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,950
but just in looking at ourselves.

557
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,730
Because only we have created all the problems

558
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,222
and it is we only, detaching ourselves from ourselves,

559
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:44,790
can see these problems and can solve them.

560
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,960
By God's Grace, as I know, you all are going to grow very much,

561
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,560
and this state is to be achieved.

562
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,454
In every state whether it is a blessing,

563
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:59,840
whether it is a progress or whether it is just turmoil,

564
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,560
you have to be seaworthy.

565
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,148
Any ship which is a seaworthy is the one

566
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:09,200
which can face all kinds of beautiful voyages

567
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,800
or even turmoil and even the tempest.

568
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,038
May God bless you.
