1
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,967
So we have all gathered here today

2
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:40,390
in this country of Austria,

3
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:42,994
which in Sanskrit we call it Astra.

4
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,474
 Astra means: The divine weapons.

5
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:57,393
 And the greatest credit,
 I would give to Austria is this:

6
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:03,842
That you don´t find 
any fundamentalism of any kind,

7
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:09,259
whether it is Islam, or whether
 it is Christian, or Hindu.

8
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:13,717
 any kind of fundamentalism
operating in this country.

9
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:18,647
Which is a very, very, very rare thing.

10
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:25,328
 Right from Russia to England you find everywhere

11
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:31,517
there is a subtle fundamentalism existing.

12
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:35,249
And this country has this speciality

13
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:38,354
that there is no fundamentalism.

14
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,003
And also racialism you don´t feel here at all.

15
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:46,093
 In every country I have felt that there is racialism.

16
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:49,829
 Of course, in Russia, there isn´t. 
But otherwise.

17
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:58,671
 So this country seems to be
 a very open minded country

18
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:05,998
and perhaps because they have 
such beautiful nature with them.

19
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:13,186
In this beautiful nature they want to enjoy the nature

20
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:16,124
and for that you have to have an open heart.

21
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,855
Or maybe the vice versa, the nature
must have opened their heart.

22
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:25,764
So, this land has a speciality:

23
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,404
And I am very happy you all have from all the way

24
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:32,697
 from so many countries, even from America, Australia,

25
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:38,387
 India, such far-off countries you have assembled here

26
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:45,696
 for this celebration and yesterday we actually saw

27
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:50,502
ourselves, with our own eyes,
 the grace falling on this country.

28
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:53,202
Cause this country deserves it.

29
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:57,470
Any country which has fundamentalism behind it,

30
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:59,892
 will have to go down in this modern times.

31
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:04,941
 Any kind of fundamentalism is out of date

32
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:08,233
 and they cannot survive.
They will be thrown out.

33
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:12,700
 Out of the evolution of the societies.

34
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:17,647
So: One has to open yourself to everything.

35
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:23,095
 Moreover, Sahaja Yoga encompasses all the great religions

36
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,460
and all the great incarnations, 
prophets and saints.

37
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:33,755
We respect all of them equally,

38
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,259
 like the jews respect Christ as they respect Moses,

39
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:44,052
 the Muslims respect Moses, as they respect Muhammed Sahab,

40
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:48,752
the Hindus respect Muhammed Sahab,
as they respect Shri Rama.

41
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,815
This kind of a mutual respect,

42
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,684
 that we have, is not by blind faith,

43
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:59,345
but by understanding through Sahaja Yoga,

44
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,878
 what we call  on our central nervous system

45
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:08,961
 we can feel the divine power,

46
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:14,192
and our whole being works like a computer

47
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:18,197
and we can find out what is the truth about all of them.

48
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:23,303
And that is how through our enlightenment,

49
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:29,081
in that light, we worship all these people equally the same.

50
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:35,285
 But when it starts going to
the fundamental bases,

51
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:42,278
everybody is ruining,
everybody's name is put into shame

52
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:46,426
and all these great people are looked upon

53
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,950
 as some sort of trouble-makers.

54
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:59,797
So, today´s thing speciality is that

55
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:03,264
if we have any fundamentalistic ideas within our head,

56
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,322
first of all, we should drive it out.

57
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:08,066
 In a way, whatever is happening in modern times

58
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:12,579
 is the exposure of all, that is wrong,
 evil and destructive.

59
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:17,162
And all that is today shown to us, very clearly.

60
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:19,589
 We see it so clearly happening,

61
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:25,749
that those people, who are against
 unification of the world,

62
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:32,914
 oneness of the world, and love for each other , 
are just getting exposed.

63
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,343
So, our main power is our love.

64
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,026
And that love is so effective,

65
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:42,444
 so kind, so tender, so beautiful,

66
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:48,219
 it has to be felt and to be enjoyed.

67
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,197
So I am here for a very short time with you

68
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,498
 but I´ll be coming back .

69
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:57,975
Because they want to shoot me down there but after some time

70
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,945
I´ll be here to talk to you

71
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:11,354
and I hope, you´ll enjoy this beautiful place.

72
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:25,766
 Have they arranged there?

73
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,162
Have they arranged the other place all right ?

74
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:30,877
Can we go now? Ask them.

75
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,484
In case they want, I can go and come back here,

76
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:37,216
 so I could be here for a longer period..

77
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:53,022
So let them go first, I will join.

78
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:49,574
Yet there are some more to arrive, has it?

79
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,969
All of them not yet arrived they believe.

80
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,701
Are we expecting more people?

81
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:04,358
French have not. French ? Few of them have come.

82
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:19,527
They are expecting about 800 people.
