1
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,160
So we have all gathered here today in this
country of Austria, which in Sanskrit we call

2
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:55,920
Astra. Astra means: The divine weapons. And
the greatest credit, I would give to Austria

3
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:06,440
is this: That you don´t find any fundamentalism
of any kind, whether it is Islam, or whether

4
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:15,530
it is Christian, or any kind of fundamentalism
operating in this country.

5
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:25,010
Which is a very, very, very rare thing. Right
from Russia to England you find everywhere

6
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:35,610
there is a subtle fundamentalism existing.
And this country has this speciality that

7
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,710
there is no fundamentalism here.

8
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:45,250
And also racialism you don´t feel here at
all. In every country I have felt that there

9
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:51,890
is racialism. Of course, in Russia, there
isn´t. But otherwise. So this country seems

10
00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:06,610
to be a very open minded country perhaps because
they have such a beautiful nature with them.

11
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:14,570
In this beautiful nature they want to enjoy
the nature and for that you have to have an

12
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,880
open heart. Or maybe the vice versa, the nature
must have opened their heart.

13
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,650
So, this land has a speciality: And I am very
happy you all have come from all the way from

14
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:37,240
so many countries, even from America, Australia,
India, such far-off countries you have assembled

15
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:47,620
here for this celebration and yesterday we
actually saw ourselves, with our own eyes,

16
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,180
the grace falling on this country.

17
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,980
Cause this country deserves it. Any country
which has fundamentalism behind it, will have

18
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,760
to go down in this modern times. Any kind
of fundamentalism is out of date and they

19
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,370
cannot survive. They will be thrown out. Out
of the evolution ot the societies. So: One

20
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:23,120
has to open yourself to everything. Moreover,
Sahaja Yoga encompasses all the great religions

21
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,460
and all the great incarnations, prophets and
saints.

22
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:38,460
We respect all of them equally, like the jews
respect Christ like they respect Moses, the

23
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Muslims respect Moses, as they respect Muhammed
Sav, the Hindus respect Muhammed Sav, as they

24
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:56,930
respect Shri Rama. This kind of a mutual respect,
that we have, is not by blind faith, but by

25
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:07,650
understanding of Sahaja Yoga, that on our
central nervous system we can feel the divine

26
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:16,790
power, and our whole being works like a computer
and we can find out what is the truth about

27
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,540
all of them.

28
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:27,040
And that is how through our enlightenment,
in that light, we worship all these people

29
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:37,570
all the same. But when it starts going to
the fundamental bases, everybody, everybodies

30
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:49,540
name is put into shame and all these great
people are looked upon as some sort of trouble-makers.

31
00:13:49,540 --> 00:14:03,070
So, today´s speciality is, that if we have
any fundamentalistic ideas within our head,

32
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,040
first of all, we should drive it out. In a
way, whatever is happening in our times is

33
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,660
the exposure of all, what is wrong, evil and
destructive. And all that is today shown to

34
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:24,680
us, very clearly. We see it so clearly happening,
that those people, who are against unification

35
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,100
of the world, oneness of the world, and love
for each other , are just getting exposed.

36
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:41,060
14: 36 So, our main power is our love. And
that love is so effective, so kind, so tender,

37
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:50,500
so beautiful, it has to be felt and to be
enjoyed. So I am here for a very short time

38
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,830
with you but I´ll be coming back – because
they want to shoot me down there – but after

39
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:08,710
some time…sweet laughter…I´ll be here
to talk to you and I hope, you´ll enjoy this

40
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:26,930
beautiful place. (Question to one person:
Have they arranged there? Have they arranged

41
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:33,350
the other place all right ? Can we go now?
In case they want, I can go and come back

42
00:15:33,350 --> 00:16:32,350
here, so I can be here for a longer period..).

43
00:16:32,350 --> 00:17:16,430
Are we expecting more people? French ? French
have not..few of them have come..they are

44
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,880
expecting about 800 people.
