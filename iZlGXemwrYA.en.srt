1
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:11,121
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

2
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:18,619
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

3
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:26,454
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,037
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

5
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:32,204
but surrendering means the worship,

6
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:47,412
the respect of the higher,

7
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,496
the obedience to the higher.

8
00:00:58,246 --> 00:01:00,371
Not to argue it out,

9
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,745
not to react, acceptance,

10
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:15,496
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

11
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:23,745
without questioning, without reasoning.

12
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:28,579
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

13
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:36,412
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

14
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,162
So first is the state,

15
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,703
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

16
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:52,329
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

17
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,912
If you can develop childhood first,

18
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:06,496
then everything takes proper course,

19
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:19,619
because maturity cannot take place unless

20
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:22,496
and until you start from the very beginning,

21
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:34,204
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

22
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,579
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

23
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,079
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

24
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:55,496
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

25
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:02,496
So try to develop your discretion power

26
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:16,204
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

27
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:25,703
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

28
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:36,579
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

29
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:46,954
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

30
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:51,619
or anti-innocence must be negated.

31
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:06,995
So the negation of effort

32
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:13,412
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

33
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:22,619
means the effort of negation.

34
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,995
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

35
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,454
you will have to put in effort for that.

36
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,538
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

37
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,496
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

38
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:14,620
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

39
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:21,121
from effort that makes it adulterous.

40
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:35,454
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

41
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,412
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

42
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:51,246
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

43
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:02,620
So those people who have come now,

44
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,620
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

45
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:11,246
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

46
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,995
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

47
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:30,703
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

48
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:33,954
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

49
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:47,121
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

50
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,538
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

51
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,037
Some people have an attention

52
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,664
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

53
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:18,679
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

54
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:36,538
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

55
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:45,995
So the effort that you put in

56
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:50,849
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

57
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:08,376
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

58
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,453
Look at yourself, help yourself

59
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:24,245
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

60
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:32,026
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

61
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:40,619
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

62
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,216
to understand.

63
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:52,478
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

64
00:08:56,543 --> 00:09:01,918
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

65
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,405
so that you proceed in your establishment.

66
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:18,835
May God bless you.
