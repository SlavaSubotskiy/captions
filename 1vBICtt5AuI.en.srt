1
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,400
Before we start,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,288
celebrating the birth of Christ,

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,775
we have to little bit review

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,864
what we have done after His Birth,

5
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:23,963
so that we understand where do we stand in relation to Him.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,902
I've just asked all the .......

7
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,960
He was the Son of a Virgin,

8
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:42,780
so that even the slightest blot on His name should not be created.

9
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:54,368
Because He was to do the greatest job

10
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:59,698
of creating for us Agnya awareness

11
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:05,914
which would help us to suck in all our sins,

12
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:09,885
all our conditionings and all our ego.

13
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:21,736
And this great personality was created for such a great work within ourselves.

14
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:31,146
But, unfortunately,

15
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:36,456
we have spoilt both these institutions within us

16
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:42,408
to such an extent that it's the most difficult task to give realisation to Christians.

17
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:48,947
On the one side we have too much conditioning,

18
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,888
as you know;

19
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:59,447
through Catholicism and other ideas about Christianity

20
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:04,787
we created a horrible conditioning in our superego,

21
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:11,068
which is just like a solid rock, I think, sometimes.

22
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,860
And those who have been in Catholic churches are still, get stuck up with it

23
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,722
and when they are facing me, I find their eyes are blinking

24
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,419
and the Agnya is not straight.

25
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:34,020
You have to give up all that conditioning completely if you have to really get to Sahaj Yoga.

26
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:45,031
To that extent we went that we tried to create institutions.

27
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,639
Of course, we collected money, no doubt about it, lot of money,

28
00:02:51,728 --> 00:03:01,348
all kinds of drama, of a papal order and of archbishop order and all these archbishops and of tomfoolery.

29
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,400
All kinds of nonsensical donkey people were created, absolutely.

30
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,818
They have nothing to do with Christ, they have nothing to do with God, they have no idea of Divine Life.

31
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:21,056
And to them prohibiting people from doing something was only religion.

32
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:29,425
And this has taken the West into such darkness

33
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:33,895
that Sahaja Yoga has to be worked out

34
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:39,746
in a very great speed and in a very expansive way,

35
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:49,359
otherwise you cannot get over these horrible ideas of archbishops, and the bishops and the popes.

36
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:57,901
The other side is the ego part.

37
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,229
Then people like Mr. Freud came in

38
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:10,794
and they put absolutely anti-God ideas into people, absolutely anti-God;

39
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:14,794
is against the Mother, against the Son.

40
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,052
Absolutely, it is absurd.

41
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:26,682
These anti-God devilish ideas penetrated and people started saying, "What's wrong?"

42
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:31,387
"This is all conditioning, we should remove all conditioning!"

43
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:36,567
So they became ego-oriented, which is the other side which Christ has to work out.

44
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:43,086
So I mean, after Christ has been established in the West,

45
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:49,367
they have seen to it that they create all hurdles, that are possible under the sun,

46
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:52,706
for the Agnya Chakra to open out.

47
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:59,853
Despite that, I find that all Sahaja Yogis, who are from the West

48
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:03,000
are still attached to Christianity and not to Christ.

49
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,949
There is a lingering Christianity still within you

50
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:13,379
and that Christianity has to drop out.

51
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,858
While Indians are very good at dropping out all nonsensical ideas,

52
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:21,093
because we have had lots of challenges in this country for everything:

53
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:25,682
for the conditioning we have had challenges;

54
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:29,560
for the ego oriented we have had challenges.

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,793
So people are used to this kind of a giving-up.

56
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:42,223
But in the West, we still are very much attached to that nonsense of Christianity.

57
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,156
It has nothing to do with Christ, believe me!

58
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:49,615
And this fanaticism which is lingering still in your minds

59
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:53,995
must be given-up otherwise you do not do any justice to Christ.

60
00:05:54,855 --> 00:06:00,062
That by no chance means that you take to another religion like Hinduism

61
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:04,040
or any nonsensical Jainism, or anything.

62
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:10,204
The essence, the tattwa, of Christianity is Christ,

63
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:16,821
and it is so thickly clouded by all these nonsensical things

64
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:22,908
that you really have to drop out this word 'Christianity' from your vocabulary completely,

65
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:26,838
and from your mind, otherwise you can never go to that principle.

66
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,473
It's a fact, take it from me.

67
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:41,692
And even now the attention of all the people is on what Christ said, or Mother Mary has said it,

68
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:45,257
and which has come through these horrible people to us.

69
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:56,341
So to learn about other Deities and other Great Incarnations, you neutralise this.

70
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:01,865
You must try to neutralise this too much attention by learning about other Deities,

71
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:07,709
say Shri Ganesha. If you talk about Shri Ganesha, he's the essence of Christ.

72
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,747
You understand that.

73
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:16,704
Ganesha is the essence of Christ, and Christ is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha's powers.

74
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:21,257
So, if you go to the essence...  most things, that's better.

75
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:31,204
Then, of course, Christ is there but we must see him as he is;

76
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:35,158
which very few people have seen before,

77
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:40,137
But now in Sahaja Yoga you should see Him as He was.

78
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,086
He was the Holiest of Holy, first of all

79
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,870
you accept that position.

80
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:50,725
Then this Freud nonsense has nothing to do for those who call themselves Christians:

81
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:56,975
five days they do all nonsensical of Freud and sixth day they talk of Christianity,

82
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:59,547
and seventh day they go to Church.

83
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:02,536
How can they go? I mean, how can they call themselves Christians?

84
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:07,697
By what standard? Just tell me! I mean, just think of it!

85
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:11,843
And the Indians have asked them to get out because they won't understand what it is.

86
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:15,334
It's so nonsensical, it's filth.

87
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:21,122
The Holiest of Holy, we have brought Him down to such a low level by our nonsensical ideas.

88
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:32,673
So one has to understand that these conditionings of Catholicism

89
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:36,836
made us so repulsive

90
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:45,004
to ourselves that we took to the other side which is even worse, much worse than the conditioning itself.

91
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,850
And you come in contact with these people morning till evening.

92
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,975
Either they are Freudians or they are so-called Christians;

93
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:01,940
even after realisation! But you must know you are special people.

94
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:08,956
You are above them. You've risen above them. Christ is awakened.

95
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:14,485
So, to do justice to Christ,

96
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:20,725
you must get over all your conditionings, to begin with, of Christianity, if you have any.

97
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:26,642
Or if you have been freudian get rid of that horrible fellow, absolutely.

98
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:30,763
He was anti-Christ! Sick, sick, sick!

99
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:39,163
We have nothing to do with Freud's ideas, even this much.

100
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:42,658
Believe me!

101
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:46,798
We are not to justify him at any point for anything.

102
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,552
He took full advantage of the repulsion people developed out of the conditionings.

103
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:58,344
And then he built up all these stories,

104
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,974
because he was himself a very low level man;

105
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,652
not to be counted as a human being from any standard.

106
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,355
You see, Christ came for human beings, but not for these low level people.

107
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,995
Even the lepers were better than him, I think.

108
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,695
Horrible it is!

109
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:21,024
Even to think about the whole thing makes me nauseated.

110
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,663
It's very unholy.

111
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:37,024
So, for all practical purposes, we have to understand that we have nothing to do with Mr. Freud.

112
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:45,114
He is filth, he is dirt, he is absolutely a low level man.

113
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:48,874
We have nothing to learn from him nor from his ideas.

114
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:56,224
Now, the other side of it is the conditioning of the churches.

115
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,754
There are still many Sahaja yogis still confused with it.

116
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:08,504
Of course, if you have to save the Christians, so-called, you have to take them out of the conditioning.

117
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:17,273
Luckily, we have someone who is writing a thesis about these things,

118
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:24,922
how these things are dangerous to society.

119
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:35,711
But still nobody realises this is anti-Christ activity; to condition you is a anti-Christ activity.

120
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:45,389
Christ came on this Earth where Moses has laid down the dharma;

121
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,613
after him, so many years later.

122
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:55,750
He thought people would be in balance and He has to give the message of his resurrection and ascent.

123
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:58,259
That's how He came on Earth.

124
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,681
But then they created even worse things than the shariat.

125
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,951
Shariat is in the Bible.

126
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,567
All these laws are in the Bible where they say that: anybody who does this should be killed,

127
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,798
anybody who does like that should be beheaded. It's all in the Bible.

128
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,721
You see whatever these Muslims are doing is all in the Bible,

129
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,797
it's coming from Bible.

130
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:26,254
So, to neutralise all that, Mr. Freud started another style.

131
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:34,392
For us Divine laws are binding because we know that's the only way one can rise.

132
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,581
It is not compulsory,

133
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:44,692
but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise,

134
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,773
that we have to be alright.

135
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:51,812
There are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga but this is how we improve,

136
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:59,061
this is how we go further, so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it.

137
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:04,315
That's why realisation should give you that strength

138
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:12,375
to fight anti-Christ activities within your mind.

139
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,225
You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying.

140
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,312
Not only that you have to face yourself,

141
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:26,451
but you have to face the so-called society that is around you

142
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:35,721
and see for yourself that these conditionings

143
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:45,985
and these anti-Christ activities, into which you have indulged,

144
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:52,148
are completely detrimental to your growth and to your ascent.

145
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:55,778
And as you are special people

146
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,065
who have got realisation

147
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:06,865
you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions. No use arguing out with others.

148
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:12,548
As you know, with the conditioning, people get quiet,

149
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,220
they don't talk, but the conditioning is growing inside.

150
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,105
With the ego people talk too much

151
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:27,758
and they aggress others with their talking and the ego is growing too much.

152
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:31,243
So one has to be in the witness state.

153
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,019
That means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk

154
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,038
and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet.

155
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:40,836
This is at the Vishuddhi level.

156
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:43,076
At the Agnya level,

157
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:50,528
you have to detest all that is ugly,

158
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,677
all that is unholy, all that is filth.

159
00:14:55,368 --> 00:15:00,806
Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you,

160
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:05,860
a new sensitivity to holiness, to auspiciousness.

161
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:10,211
Try to improve this auspiciousness within you.

162
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:19,288
I find people get very easily attached to negative people,

163
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:22,908
they get identified with negative people.

164
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:24,719
It's very common.

165
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:30,139
And they think that they have been sympathetic. It is a sympathy they are working in.

166
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:38,879
It could be your sister, could be your brother, mother, or could be your wife, your child.

167
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,307
It can be anyone.

168
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,734
But by getting attached to such people,

169
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:47,875
you are really harming that person because that person will go down to hell,

170
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:51,144
and you will also go down to hell.

171
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,874
So if you want to do any good to the person,

172
00:15:53,951 --> 00:16:01,471
best thing is not to be attached to that person and tell that person that these are anti-Christ activities.

173
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,903
And get attached to that group which is positive, which is doing auspicious work,

174
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:09,995
which is doing Holy work.

175
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:14,566
And understand that the strength lies in getting attached to that group,

176
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:20,975
than getting attached to one, some singled-out, negative personality.

177
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:26,201
Now, every one of you has had some experience of this.

178
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:33,542
I'll give you an example of Warren's wife, she's not here, neither he is here.

179
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,442
But it's nice to understand what happened, in her case.

180
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:41,432
He was very attached to her. He married her. He asked me.

181
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,254
I was really shocked that he's so insensitive. Why can't he see her?

182
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,062
Why can't he understand her? But I did not know what to say now.

183
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,086
I said, if I say, "Don't marry,"

184
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:57,091
he will think that Mother is trying to force him down or something. I did know what to say but I was really shocked

185
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,990
and for about two minutes, I didn't say anything.

186
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,391
And she also played her cards very well.

187
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,971
And I said, "Alright, you can marry.

188
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:14,317
You'll get happiness. If you think you can get happiness, that's all.

189
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:18,067
I didn't say "joy." "If you think you can get happiness, marry her."

190
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,516
Now she got married to him.

191
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:24,467
Then he said she must come with him to England.

192
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,307
He brought her. He tried to avoid. I told him "Warren be careful."

193
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:34,721
Then they lost their passports.

194
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:37,555
He found his passport, she did not.

195
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:42,326
But he got after my life, he said, "Please ask Mr. Shrivastava somehow get her passport.

196
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:46,625
Passport should be there." I said, "Alright." Then they made her passport.

197
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:52,008
Then she came with him. Still she was continuing.

198
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,925
I told that, "Please send away this lady. I don't want her to be with me.

199
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:58,576
It's a headache. All the 24 hours she is with me.

200
00:17:58,653 --> 00:18:04,326
I must have some time without these horrible bhoots around me. Please get rid of her, she is bad."

201
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:06,190
But he couldn't understand it.

202
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,076
Still he was siding with her.

203
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,605
Then one day it happened that she attacked my heart.

204
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:21,692
The heart got into a big fist.

205
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:26,901
I said, "Now you put hand on my heart and see it." It was throbbing like anything.

206
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:31,865
He couldn't put his hand, couldn't even bring it near it. I said, "Now please ask her to get down."

207
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:33,903
Then she got down and it stopped.

208
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:40,173
Then he realised this is the thing. But still he did not give her up,

209
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,990
he did not give her up. I went to Los Angeles, everywhere she followed me.

210
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,451
The sympathy, you see.

211
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:51,519
She could have gone away, she was quite a robust lady, no problem.

212
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:56,086
But in Los Angeles, then she started showing her teeth to him, gradually.

213
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:04,701
And then, ultimately, he got into trouble. He started getting the pains.

214
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,413
But as soon as I left Los Angeles, she got her epilepsy.

215
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:14,678
And he realised how dangerous it was to carry her all the time with me.

216
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:19,442
Now he can't send her away because she has epilepsy, so he took her back.

217
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:25,442
She tried to disrupt all the ashram by telling them her sympathy story,

218
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:32,961
"Oh, you know, my husband, he wants to leave me," this, that, nonsense - and all of them fell for it.

219
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:38,000
Now, she's a bhoot, and a bhoot, and a bhoot; and the bhoot started increasing.

220
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:44,673
One more bhoot added, sympathy you give them, one more bhoot added, once you give her sympathy. One more bhoot added.

221
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:53,556
And she was creating problems, "This is not good, he is not good, he is against me. This family is against me. That is against me."

222
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:01,471
Then he got heart attack, Terrence got heart attack - that's it.

223
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:08,134
So then he sent her away. Now you do not repeat all that nonsense.

224
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:16,980
Negativity is not to be tolerated, nor to be carried on with.

225
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:20,902
Discretion is the better part of valour.

226
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:25,875
One need not be afraid, but discretion is better part of valour.

227
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:29,836
Alright? If you have negativity, better get rid of it.

228
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:36,747
If somebody is so negative, better have nothing to do with that person, whatever may be the relationship. Just have nothing to do with them.

229
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:44,055
Because no use going down. If you are a seeker, you are a responsible seeker and a Sahaja yogi, one has to be careful.

230
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,046
This is on a Christmas day, I have to say, because there only the fight starts

231
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:56,969
at the Agnya Chakra. Because if you shift from the principle of Christ you start giving argument in support of the negativity

232
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:01,903
always - in the opposite direction. Alright?

233
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:06,384
And you have all the arguments which works against Christ.

234
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:17,528
The same Agnya Chakra, when it goes funny, you start seeing things very reasonable which are absolutely false and wrong.

235
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,980
So we have to be alert.

236
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,288
We have to be with Christ.

237
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:28,240
Now, they will say, also, about getting vibrations, Mother, alright.

238
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:35,162
I am also very much there. It's true, we saw the vibrations.

239
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,422
Nothing doing!

240
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:45,296
I feel embarrassed. Sometimes I do not tell

241
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:46,476
I feel embarrassed.

242
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:52,670
And people also try to manoeuvre me by playing tricks on me,

243
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:57,038
so that I am rather worried, sometimes, how to tell people.

244
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:03,124
Because I have seen ego-oriented people are extremely sensitive.

245
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:08,295
Now they are not arrogant, that's one thing is there, but they are extremely sensitive.

246
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:15,028
And if you tell them anything they will not accept. Like yesterday, I lashed all the Poona people, they said, "It was for our good."

247
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:19,409
Nobody said that, "Mother why did you say such and such thing?"

248
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:22,518
No, Not one word. Everybody said, "It was for our good."

249
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:29,201
But in the West if you lash them, then you will be lashed. Nobody is going to take it that way.

250
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:36,374
So I have to tell you one thing to have your ego problems settled,

251
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:41,509
first of all, see that you are not playing to your ego.

252
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:48,778
And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots,

253
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:55,269
all these conditionings have become bhoots in you. All the Church bhoots have got into your heads.

254
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,586
They are all there.

255
00:22:56,634 --> 00:23:02,730
So you must see that these bhoots are not there, because we have to be holy

256
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:07,442
we have to be clean, we have to be resurrected.

257
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:11,797
We are resurrected people, Christ has resurrected us.

258
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:16,144
But you have to think how much he has to work for us.

259
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:21,634
The more you try to be in unison with negativity,

260
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:28,817
we harm Him more, we torture Him more, we trouble Him more.

261
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:35,132
The One who was born in the manger in the most difficult circumstances,

262
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:43,401
where everybody requires comfort,

263
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:52,028
who was from the very beginning, went through hazardous life till His death,

264
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:57,919
His birth itself, you can see, was in a cowshed.

265
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:01,939
None of you are born in a cowshed.

266
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,836
And while the Christians are so particular about comforts,

267
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:12,932
most surprising is, while Christ was born in a cowshed.

268
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:20,027
In a very, very cold night Christ was born.

269
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:28,594
Nothing much to cover: sparkling, beauty it was.

270
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:36,086
Now we have to keep Him, within ourselves, comfortable.

271
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:46,326
We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra.

272
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:53,769
Manger of thoughts and a crown of thoughts

273
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,220
that we are not going to give Him.

274
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:05,750
We are going to make Him comfortable by not accepting negativity as a sympathy.

275
00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:23,519
You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya,

276
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:34,919
that we do not torture Him by our useless ideas,

277
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:47,816
uncomfortable behaviours, inauspicious appearances and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

278
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:51,490
Try to respect Him.

279
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:58,653
There He stands, try to make Him very comfortable.

280
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:06,288
I wish I could do that but He resides in everybody's Agnya Chakra.

281
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:12,458
If He was only in my Agnya I would have given Him the greatest comfort.

282
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:16,719
But He wants to be manifested in everybody's Agnya.

283
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:21,439
So I have to request you, as a Mother, to look after Him.

284
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:26,064
Give Him a nice cradle,

285
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:29,324
give Him a comfortable time,

286
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:33,478
because He's born to give you your resurrection.

287
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:41,633
He's taken up such a great responsibility to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego,

288
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:48,067
but that does not mean that you put stones on top of Him.

289
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:54,375
It's like, sometimes I find the conditioning of some of the people in the West is so great

290
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:59,343
that a big mountain is falling on this Little Child.

291
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:04,353
And sometimes I find a bad breath,

292
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:12,545
horrible breath of ego, which stinks, blowing like a big wind towards Him, horrible stink.

293
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:19,150
It's coming out of this terrible type of a ego;

294
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:29,019
absolutely not the way to treat the King of Kings who is born within you.

295
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:36,443
You are so respected that Christ is born within your Agnya,

296
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,298
but you must respect your Agnya Chakra.

297
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,586
Your attention should be in the centre

298
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:56,740
so there's no wobbliness. Imagine put a child, like they say, "a child is put on the winds."

299
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:09,076
So this Agnya Chakra is to be kept very clean, healthy and holy.

300
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:13,393
The attention should be holy.

301
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:21,374
The attention outside is still not very holy, should be detached attention.

302
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:28,825
If you start seeing through your Agnya it should project a power of holiness,

303
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:36,757
so that anybody who looks at your eyes, should know that serenity is flowing from these eyes

304
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:40,326
and not lust and greed and aggression.

305
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:49,019
All this we can achieve because we've got Christ within our Agnya.

306
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,960
Accept him there.

307
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,259
He's born - let him grow.

308
00:28:55,314 --> 00:29:04,423
I am sure Sahaja Yogis will understand the importance of the Agnya Chakra.

309
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,528
In the East, no problem because to them He is only Ganesha.

310
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:18,230
Ganesha is a child and they know for definite the childhood has no contaminations, no problems, nothing.

311
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:23,765
So they are still children as far as sin is concerned.

312
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:29,615
There is a story: one pastor went to a village, and gave a big lecture to them,

313
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,625
and the villagers had to thank.

314
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:36,253
So he got up and said, "Thank you very much for telling us all about it.

315
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:43,057
We did not know what was sin and thank God you have told us that there is sin!"

316
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,259
So this awareness is not in their heads, they don't understand it.

317
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:54,131
You will be surprised, you can't outdo Indians. They won't understand what it means, you know.

318
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:59,587
They may say it's Freud, this, that, but they don't understand, it is so anti-God.

319
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,429
Actually I did not know till the other day,

320
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:06,105
when Rustom told me, with great hesitation, what it means, really.

321
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:12,144
So that is what it is and we have to understand this.

322
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,875
Today is the great day of holiness. Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra.

323
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:27,594
And let us sing praise of Him so that He, in His pure essence, in His holy body, He should be there.

324
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:32,153
Not Christianity and neither Freudian nonsense!

325
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:35,951
Christianity is equally bad as Freud.

326
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:37,903
There is no difference, I find.

327
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,951
Whether you kill the child with the mountains falling on him or

328
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:48,402
with a horrible stinky, dirty-smelling breeze blowing on him,

329
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:53,534
it's just the same. So please get rid of both ideas - absolutely.

330
00:30:53,624 --> 00:31:02,413
And in purity you respect Him. Absolutely in purity, because He is purity.

331
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:08,294
Now you may say that, "Mother if He is purity..." There are some stupid people who ask me.

332
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:11,759
"If He's purity, then how can we make Him impure?"

333
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:17,153
But, I mean, if you do not respect Him, why will He be there? He will disappear.

334
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:22,295
He likes purity. He will disappear from there! It is not good for you.

335
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:30,394
So better create a cradle, a beautiful cradle, of love,

336
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:35,675
of honesty, as His Mother prepared for Him,

337
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:41,163
with all sweetness and kindness and assurance

338
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:48,470
that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

339
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:51,103
May God bless you all.

340
00:31:55,083 --> 00:32:04,710
You can sing. After food we will have a bonfire here and then we can sing a nice, some carols,

341
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:10,846
till twelve o'clock and then our great friend

342
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,961
who is here, Mehrotra,

343
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:19,220
he has decided to give you some cakes and tea,

344
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:24,471
We'll have some cakes and tea and then you can sleep off.

345
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:31,104
And tomorrow morning, as I told you, is the celebration of His birth, in a full way

346
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:37,651
by all the people. Not only by you but by Indians and other people who are here.

347
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:41,951
You all have to celebrate. It's a very great thing.

348
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,586
And unless and until you show the signs of holiness and auspiciousness

349
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:54,384
Indians are not going to be impressed by Him, I can tell you this much, not going to be impressed.

350
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:58,199
They can't understand these pastors coming here

351
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:03,807
and these padres telling them about Christ.

352
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:06,769
They just cannot believe it. How can He be like that?

353
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:11,567
There's another interesting story, make the whole thing very...

354
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:17,019
Once there was a fellow from a village:

355
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:20,961
so his name was Bura, means a blondie

356
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:24,672
and he came and they said, "You become a Christian,"

357
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:27,182
So he said, "Oh, I'll become a Christian."

358
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,554
He made him a Christian. He said, "We have to change the name."

359
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:36,173
He said, "But my name is Blondie." He said, "Alright, we'll give you another name." He called him Alexander.

360
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:42,942
So his name was Mr. Blondie Alexander, Bura Alexander.

361
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:49,509
Now this Bura Alexander used to come to Allahabad

362
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:53,490
where always he would go and have his bath in the river Ganges.

363
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,884
So the pastor said, "Now you can't do it.

364
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:59,938
Now you are a Christian you can't go and have a bath in the river Ganges."

365
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:01,188
He said, "Why?

366
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:08,318
I have become a sahib, I have become an Englishman now but I have not given up my religion."

367
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:14,311
In his own language he said, "I have not given up my religion.

368
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:19,751
It's alright, I know the river Ganges is my Mother and She has got vibrations.

369
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,574
I am not going to give up that.

370
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:26,634
Of course, I have become a sahib now. I have become an Englishman."

371
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:30,273
So that's the idea they had about Christianity.

372
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:46,188
Any questions you have, you can ask me and then the food is ready, you better go and have your food.

373
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,197
When you become thoughtless and we.... We don't see clearly

374
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,706
is that good or..? Because when you are in very nice

375
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:57,534
it is difficult for us to see clearly.

376
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:00,414
unclear

377
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:01,873
You don't see what?

378
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:03,213
Visually you mean?

379
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:18,188
He says when he is in thoughtless awareness he cannot see clearly anymore.

380
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,128
Really?

381
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:25,172
I think you must be seeing more than what you seen normally!

382
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:32,434
Alexander is correct. When you are thoughtlessly aware your eyes, you see the pupils, are dilated.

383
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:36,951
It's correct. But you take it higher, the Kundalini, slightly higher. Push it up.

384
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:41,849
Alright? If Kundalini is staying at thoughtless awareness means just dilated, you see

385
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:45,639
and the eyes can become black, but there's no sparkle.

386
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:48,951
But when it comes out then you find a sparkle in the eyes;

387
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:52,224
there is a difference in the eyes, if you see.

388
00:35:52,244 --> 00:36:01,514
The eyes get dilated, the pupils get dilated, when the Agnya Chakra is being just penetrated,

389
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:05,554
and still here it is, then you can't see clearly. Correct.

390
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:10,494
But at thoughtless awareness is all this part.

391
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:15,128
So if you push it, little up, higher - you know how to push Kundalini with your attention

392
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,422
or you watch here, or you think of Me.

393
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,773
Kundalini will go up.

394
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:23,958
Alright?

395
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,532
So thoughtless awareness is just the beginning.

396
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:32,952
And it's a great area, up to this point, up to Shri Krishna point, where you become the witness.

397
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:37,492
From the witness point, when you become here, then there is a sparkle in your eyes,

398
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:40,981
your eyes sparkle.

399
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:45,442
And the sparkle in the eyes is a sign that Kundalini is flowing well.

400
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:48,739
That time you see more than you see normally.

401
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:53,525
I mean the stars start looking bigger, everything starts looking much clearer. Alright?

402
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,561
Better now.

403
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:02,097
It's correct, dilatation of the pupil takes place.

404
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:06,688
Some people really at that time have opened their eyes and they said, "Oh we have become blind."

405
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:12,525
That's true. It happens. It's correct. Alright, now what else? It's a good question.

406
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:22,007
Mother, is there any relation between the numbers 888 and Christ?

407
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:24,931
Three eights,

408
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,853
888, there could be.

409
00:37:28,864 --> 00:37:29,884
There could be.

410
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:33,068
But what is the relationship you have found out?

411
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:36,844
Many years ago I was looking at the Hebrew Kabbalah

412
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:41,083
and they had a system of different numbers that they combine.

413
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,534
Kabbalah!

414
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,847
That is. That they must be having 888 is alright.

415
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:51,364
Because, you see, their chakras don't move in 6 form.

416
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:57,811
That is that they should move, but they move in 888 because you see,

417
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,760
the 8 we don't have any chakra, so they are on the sides.

418
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:05,221
They are on the Left Side, Kabbalah is on the left hand side,

419
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:08,623
so they work it out on 8 -  means from outside.

420
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:14,813
7, 3, 4

421
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,956
are in the centre.

422
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:20,293
Now at the 6 point,

423
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:25,179
if you have 666, means absolutely both the Swadishthana

424
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:28,199
on both the sides you occupy.

425
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:33,195
And also in the centre, so you hit all these three, that's why this number is not good.

426
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:48,371
And 888, you go onto Left Swadishthana more and use your Mooladhara,

427
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,375
it works out with Mooladhara.

428
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:58,025
It's a funny one, because 4 into 2 is 8, alright?

429
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:05,980
And 4 into 2 comes where your 4 is Mooladhara. Alright?

430
00:39:06,025 --> 00:39:12,282
Instead of going to Swadishthana, you just combine Agnya and Mooladhara,

431
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:14,773
in such a way that you go outside.

432
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,952
Alright?

433
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:19,541
Say you put your Agnya, is two,

434
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:24,387
From 2 you move this side.

435
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,054
Alright? That's all.

436
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:31,021
Kabbalah is a very dangerous thing, one should never try.

437
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,210
Then you start seeing things, future and all that, isn't it?

438
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:42,902
That's not a good thing at all. So, for us, the number is 7, 3,

439
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,012
is the best number, 7 and 3 number.

440
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:05,887
What else?

441
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,782
I would like to pick up on Alexander's question.

442
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:36,105
(A yogi asks a question about  his eyesight.) Does it have anything to do with Agnya?

443
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:43,237
Yes, yes of course. I mean, Agnya is very important and best way is to take your Kundalini up.

444
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:47,635
Don't roam about in Agnya - it's very dangerous.

445
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,804
You can be thrown, as he said, on the 4, 4, 4 side,

446
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:58,693
or you can go this side 6, 6, 6, 6. It works out 6, 6, 6, 6 this side and 4, 4, 4, 4 this side.

447
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:03,393
It's dangerous. Never go. You see Agnya you should be very careful.

448
00:42:03,431 --> 00:42:08,065
You should never roam about in Agnya because it's thrown out, the attention is thrown out,

449
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:08,994
projected.

450
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:13,034
You start seeing things; all problematic, very problematic.

451
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:20,172
Try to take your Kundalini out all the time.

452
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:23,543
See that it's coming out. Put your attention there.

453
00:42:23,612 --> 00:42:28,387
And the best is, now, is to put your attention to me, because I am at Sahasrara.

454
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:35,876
And don't allow your Kundalini to remain in Agnya part; it's dangerous,

455
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,717
no doubt.

456
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:49,737
You have become subtler and you can start moving left and right if you want to, and if you try to.

457
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:54,458
Any other question?

458
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:20,356
I don't understand one thing: that is the connection of images like are described in certain books and our thoughtless state.

459
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:26,068
Alright, I'll tell you. If you start closing your eyes, say you are sleepy,

460
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:32,010
and you start seeing images at that time. That means you are going on to the Left Side;

461
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:37,094
there are dead bodies, you start seeing their faces, this, that. You are going to the Left Side.

462
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:44,864
Now supposing you start seeing lights and stars and this and that - all sorts of things,

463
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,670
I mean, more the colours, we should say - you are moving on the right hand side.

464
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,911
So try to avoid it. Say, "I don't want it," you should say.

465
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:59,228
And you try to put your Agnya - if it is left, you put it to the right side or if it is right - just by pushing it.

466
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:02,757
Like this and like that.

467
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:10,101
But what happens that, after some time, when you have achieved a certain state of higher consciousness

468
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:13,751
then, if you want, you can penetrate into these areas,

469
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,302
you can see all these things. But then you something, different type of things you see, for example,

470
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,835
you might see from my Sahasrara - huge, big these valayas coming out,

471
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:29,215
or something like that. That's a different point altogether.

472
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:38,300
And also sometimes you might see a little flame

473
00:44:38,315 --> 00:44:42,110
that's a good sign, that means somebody's guiding you.

474
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,900
But you have to be careful

475
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:48,271
not to indulge into these things because there is a guidance for you

476
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:55,800
and you are all followed by great Deities, no doubt, but you should not try to sort of hanker after that.

477
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:59,739
If they are there, let it be, because you see your Agnya is very important.

478
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:03,134
You should not allow your Agnya to be attracted by these things.

479
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:09,833
You might just find a flame, like that. Sometime you might just find a little dot: shining dot.

480
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:15,262
They are all actually angels who are with you and try to assure you.

481
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:17,081
But that's not important.

482
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:23,032
What is important is, on your way, you should go further and do not go this side or that side.

483
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:32,005
But if you are seeing every day those images then try to push it back, or this way, whichever way it is

484
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:38,070
and try to finish them, so that you go further. That means you are sticking on to the same point,

485
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:41,650
or you are moving in the other direction on the sides.

486
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,041
Because direction should be further and further and further.

487
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,329
What else?

488
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:04,896
How should we protect our subconscious as we cannot be conscious about it?

489
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,405
You need not. I mean,

490
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:12,333
you don't have to worry!

491
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:16,119
You just keep to the conscious. Alright?

492
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:22,021
You don't protect anything, actually you don't do anything, if you see Alexander; what do you do?

493
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:26,391
We are just enjoying!

494
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:27,501
Yes, just enjoy.

495
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:30,282
That's the best part. Just enjoy!

496
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:34,326
Just I want you to enjoy.

497
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:38,916
Don't create problems for yourself that's all, and just enjoy. Alright?

498
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:41,565
Just don't create problems for yourself.

499
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:46,434
Don't be ambitious. Don't be aggressive.

500
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:51,813
And don't be, I mean that's rarely so, but submissive too much to others.

501
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:57,202
That's rarely so. But be submissive to Sahaja Yoga.

502
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,851
Be surrendered to Sahaj Yoga.<br>

503
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:09,436
I would like to know who are the people from Perth. Can you get up?

504
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,126
People from Perth?

505
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:17,233
So, give me your names.

506
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:18,023
Robin Reid

507
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:19,704
Robin Reid

508
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:20,733
What's yours?

509
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:26,483
His I know.

510
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:28,295
Now, who else is there?

511
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,376
Sit down. Sit down all of you.

512
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:33,485
I can't see you. Come forward. Please.

513
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,065
Michael Reid

514
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,014
Mother there's a family, mother, father and two sons.

515
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:46,954
Where?

516
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:51,297
Mother's here, father was Robin and the two boys.

517
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:53,954
Mother and father, where is he?

518
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,068
Father and

519
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:58,847
two boys. There's one here, the other boy... Is Tim here?

520
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:00,268
Ah nice.

521
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:01,898
Come forward, I can't see

522
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:05,485
So what's your name? What's the mother's name?

523
00:48:05,505 --> 00:48:07,233
Jo. Alright.

524
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:09,536
So this is what I wanted to know.

525
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:12,155
Please be seated.

526
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:18,583
Who are the Sahaja Yogis who are seeing me for the first time in India?

527
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:28,972
In India?

528
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:29,992
In India.

529
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:37,469
I mean, I don't mean that.

530
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:45,739
I mean for the first time, because after coming to India, because you've seen me before. Alright.

531
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:51,414
So, apart from Perth, now let's see.  What's your name?

532
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:53,369
Julie

533
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:54,760
From where are you?

534
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:56,166
From Sydney?

535
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,885
Loudly.

536
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,635
From Belgium.

537
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:05,038
Melbourne.

538
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,271
Robert Webber from Adelaide.

539
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,132
Good.

540
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:11,262
Rodney Woodhouse from Melbourne

541
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:13,273
Who else?

542
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:19,617
From Chandigah?

543
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:22,717
From Geneva!

544
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:25,782
What's your name?

545
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:26,612
Guy

546
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:27,532
Guillaume

547
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:28,177
Guy

548
00:49:31,998 --> 00:49:34,155
It's G U Y

549
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,744
It's pronounced ghee like ghee.

550
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:37,594
Guy, alright.

551
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,360
Make yourself comfortable.

552
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,760
Who else?

553
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,780
Albert Lewis,

554
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:44,833
What's he saying?

555
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,199
Albert Lewis.

556
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:47,333
From?

557
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:48,742
Sydney.

558
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,079
Sydney! Sit down, please.

559
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,076
So, who's that? Come forward.  I can't see.

560
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,480
In the light. Yes please.

561
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:02,141
Gillian

562
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:04,958
Gillian Walker from Sydney.

563
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:05,539
Alright.

564
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:07,052
John Williams from Sydney

565
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,152
Good

566
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:15,427
So now, I will be going to Sydney

567
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:21,635
He's from Mexico.

568
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:23,204
From Australia really.

569
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,902
He is, yes. What's his name?

570
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:29,632
Martin Moliere

571
00:50:31,181 --> 00:50:33,380
May God bless you. From Sydney?

572
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:40,639
There are two boys, Martin and Peter who just stood up, both of whom originally came from Mexico and they've been in Australia for about 10 years.

573
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:50,652
So now, we have... we have met now here

574
00:50:50,795 --> 00:50:56,768
I am going now this time to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide.  What else?

575
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:01,434
We're going to Perth on the 1st and then to Adelaide about the 4th

576
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:09,193
then to Melbourne on the 11th and then to Sydney about the 15th.

577
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:18,139
then you are returning on the 23rd, 22nd, 23rd after Your birthday which will be celebrated on the 21st in Sydney.

578
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,818
If we may Mother?

579
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:32,882
Very successful with the doctors.

580
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:34,237
Rustom has been Mother.

581
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:35,702
What happened Rustom?

582
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,775
Only 3?

583
00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:45,751
3 or 4 but one of them could feel

584
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:50,496
and as there were some patients and as I was treating they could feel the chakras moving.

585
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:56,807
So that convinced them.  And as we said mantras we could feel the cool vibrations flowing.

586
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:59,539
But this Dr Ahuja is a good lady.

587
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:08,581
The other chap is a Sardarji. His name is Sampurna Singh.  He felt it too and the other could feel a little bit.

588
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:12,538
He's coming tomorrow, because he wants to find out more.

589
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:18,969
But tomorrow, I don't know what time we'll have a chance to talk to them, because, we are all going for a picnic tomorrow.

590
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:22,452
Vaneshwara

591
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:29,302
there's a river there, you can go and enjoy yourself and then you have to climb up.

592
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:33,143
Very close by, I think you have seen the place there.

593
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:39,646
And maybe that we might get a place in that garden, now for our ashram.

594
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:40,559
Maybe.

595
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:50,054
We're thinking of having a camp there.

596
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:53,577
But this time we came rather early.

597
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:59,447
but next time we might have a camp in that Vaneswara area. When we come back.

598
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:02,342
It's a very serene place

599
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,143
Very serene

600
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:13,259
So day after tomorrow is the Puja and I was thinking that... for the Puja Saree though?

601
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:19,833
You people want to pay for it.  Australians,  but you should take money from all of them.

602
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:22,367
Mother we have done that. We've taken it from all.  That's been done.

603
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:24,985
Not only from...  You've done it. Alright.

604
00:53:24,983 --> 00:53:26,817
and have you paid it.

605
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,494
Nicholas has already collected it

606
00:53:28,527 --> 00:53:33,342
Whom are  you supposed to pay?

607
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:36,800
Whom are you supposed to pay that money?

608
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:42,360
The money comes... Nicholas is collecting it. He's holding all the money, from all the Centres,

609
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:48,304
both the Collective money and the individual Centre's money and then he is going to settle up in London.

610
00:53:48,414 --> 00:53:52,335
No, no, no, no. Oh I see. Oh I see.

611
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,463
Alright.

612
00:53:55,155 --> 00:53:56,355
With Rajesh.

613
00:53:57,293 --> 00:54:00,512
Rustom and Nicholas have that one in hand.

614
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,222
Alright.

615
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:18,597
I would like to know where do we have Centres, which are not yet been given any presents

616
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,677
and who are newly started.

617
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,791
Raise your hands.

618
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:36,155
No, no, no, not for me. I have to buy presents for the new Centres.

619
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:38,425
For the new Centres.

620
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:46,487
You see for the other things, see the one you have brought for Me.  That's my personal thing.

621
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,873
For which we are going to settle. That's a different thing.

622
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:55,208
But this is what presents I have to give to Centres for the Puja;

623
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:59,585
which I have already given to some people isn't it; to Sydney people

624
00:55:00,987 --> 00:55:04,858
and have I given to Melbourne people anything so far?

625
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:11,525
So raise your hands.  All of you whom I have not given to the Centres; one for every Collective.

626
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:13,333
Say Melbourne

627
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:16,496
Adelaide and Perth. Three.

628
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:20,186
Three. In Europe?

629
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:23,326
He's saying Dublin Mother.

630
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:24,114
Dublin.

631
00:55:24,126 --> 00:55:26,235
Dublin in Ireland he said.

632
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,815
Alright Dublin, now four

633
00:55:30,878 --> 00:55:32,847
Toronto, five

634
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,619
Six. What else?

635
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:40,905
Sheffield?

636
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:47,072
That is different. Alright. Six. More? Number 6

637
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,594
Monteret

638
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:50,632
Monteret. Six, seven

639
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:54,518
Alright Sheffield eight

640
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,400
Rouen and Poitiere Mother.

641
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:00,978
Two cities in France, Rouen and Poitiere

642
00:56:01,574 --> 00:56:02,766
Are there Centres?

643
00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:10,815
Poitiere is Laurent's mother and Rouen we have started a very nice Centre

644
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,661
So now nine.

645
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:15,840
What's more?

646
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:17,179
Belgium Mother.

647
00:56:17,201 --> 00:56:19,530
Belgium. Ten.

648
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:20,588
Vienna?

649
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:22,266
Eleven

650
00:56:22,391 --> 00:56:23,692
Portugal?

651
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:28,081
Yes and Portugal and Spain.

652
00:56:30,594 --> 00:56:37,530
Polermo in Sicily in the South of Italy

653
00:56:42,123 --> 00:56:44,032
Los Angelos?

654
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:45,672
That we have done.

655
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:50,952
New York we have done.

656
00:56:54,016 --> 00:57:00,376
Again raise the hands. Those who have suggested just now, one each. Come along raise the hands, one each.

657
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:04,996
No, no, one each. One hand.

658
00:57:05,362 --> 00:57:07,467
Yes! Alright two!

659
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:13,257
One, from where?

660
00:57:13,775 --> 00:57:18,715
For England you leave just now... England will have. England you forget. Just now I'm saying.

661
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:22,679
One, two, three, four, five, six,

662
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:24,960
Seven, eight, nine.

663
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:29,840
Ten. I counted you?

664
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,268
Did I count you?

665
00:57:33,193 --> 00:57:34,922
That's Englebert from Austria.

666
00:57:34,987 --> 00:57:38,166
Just count again.  Again raise your hands.

667
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:51,103
What was the tenth one?  There was a tenth. Ah Dublin.

668
00:57:57,425 --> 00:58:01,833
It is eleven. No, no, no, no.

669
00:58:01,842 --> 00:58:04,152
He had his two hands up

670
00:58:04,143 --> 00:58:06,603
No, no! One.

671
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:11,222
Keep it eleven. You see eleven is a good number.

672
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,021
But twelve....

673
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:16,632
I have to...

674
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,570
Lausanne

675
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,221
Lausanne?

676
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:23,706
Yes Lausanne.

677
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:24,731
It's 11.

678
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:37,322
Germany... you see little bit shaky things you better not:

679
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,523
because I have to get something for all these Centres, so let's keep it eleven.

680
00:58:41,612 --> 00:58:44,083
Now, raise hands of eleven people.

681
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:54,893
You see it should be done in a place where you are really definite. Alright?

682
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:56,882
Alright.

683
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:59,681
You keep it at eleven.

684
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:08,621
Where you are definite. Just put it down.

685
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:13,846
For English people, we have another way of doing things.

686
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:16,181
Now in England how many?

687
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,460
In England?

688
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:21,202
John?

689
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,726
Do you include Derby and places like this Mother?

690
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:32,478
Alright. Derby. Scotland is included?

691
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,936
Alright, raise your hands the English.

692
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:39,170
Where you don't have.

693
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,989
I sent for Derby.

694
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,489
Alright I've sent for Derby.

695
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:47,063
Scotland I have sent already. Alright.

696
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:50,362
No, no, no, John I didn't give you anything?

697
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:53,648
No, one. From which part?

698
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:54,652
Reading.

699
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:56,813
One Reading, one

700
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,208
London he is saying!

701
00:59:59,273 --> 01:00:00,902
London?

702
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:08,547
Who is that?

703
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,704
He's hiding Mother.

704
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:16,204
Nick

705
01:00:21,864 --> 01:00:29,268
You are the luckiest among of all of them, I may say. Alright, I know what you mean, but that's separate.

706
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:30,719
One

707
01:00:36,692 --> 01:00:41,572
Alright, one, two, three

708
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:44,251
Which one is that?

709
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:48,713
I've given. Birmingham, Derbyshire.

710
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,277
Alright.

711
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:56,614
So, London...

712
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:01,637
I have to think and scratch my head,

713
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:06,827
to find what to give to London, because I've given this Mataji to you.

714
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:11,929
Now you go and have your food. I have to go out to have my dinner.

715
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,389
I don't know what will I eat, whatever it is.

716
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,320
Where are my chappals?

717
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:37,094
Re-assembled after dinner.  No sound for about 3 minutes.

718
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,994
Very beautiful, I must say.

719
01:03:58,992 --> 01:04:05,260
Little cutting has been little bit, but you can rub it off later on, because in a hurry they have done the whole job.

720
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:11,411
So this is to wish you Happy Christmas.

721
01:04:28,126 --> 01:04:30,668
They've done a good job isn't it?

722
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:35,449
We never expected. In a factory.

723
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,150
Some are smaller, some are bigger.

724
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,601
It doesn't matter. Whatever comes your way.

725
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:52,782
Ladies should take smaller and men should take bigger. That's all.

726
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:03,402
Better idea. If you want. It makes no difference.

727
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:39,132
This are together.

728
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:44,295
All of them?

729
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:09,284
You first have for yourself.

730
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:11,175
You keep one for yourself.

731
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:12,760
One for her.

732
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:28,668
Now everybody has got it?

733
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:31,757
Who doesn't have?

734
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,983
No, there are some more coming.

735
01:07:46,902 --> 01:07:51,512
There are a few sick people Mother.

736
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:53,353
How many are sick?

737
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:54,864
About four or five.

738
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:05,541
Now just go and see how many sick there are,

739
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,335
then let me know.

740
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:18,264
Come here!

741
01:08:26,515 --> 01:08:30,046
These are five for sick people.  See if you have more sick people.

742
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:44,091
Now for your Centres which I told you.

743
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:45,631
Each.

744
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:48,841
You have... one by one. Let's have it.

745
01:08:51,176 --> 01:08:56,140
Eleven Centres, let's have one by one.

746
01:08:56,992 --> 01:09:00,341
Where are they? One Centre.

747
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,149
Melbourne

748
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,153
Vienna.

749
01:09:08,761 --> 01:09:10,063
Alright.

750
01:09:11,908 --> 01:09:12,840
Adelaide.

751
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,198
Perth

752
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,029
Melbourne

753
01:09:27,537 --> 01:09:28,488
They're heavy.

754
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,390
Ireland.

755
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,564
Alright, what is it?

756
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:50,792
Rouen Mother, Rouen, or do you want to give it to Lille. Lille is advancing.

757
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:51,761
Rouen.

758
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:59,712
No, it's there, where Joan of Arc has been burned by the English.

759
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:09,273
Alright, whatever you say.

760
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,752
One more.

761
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,242
Belgium

762
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:26,551
Who else?

763
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:40,796
Which other?

764
01:10:42,024 --> 01:10:43,287
Sicily.

765
01:10:45,939 --> 01:10:50,243
Now what happened to one more. We had eleven.

766
01:10:56,113 --> 01:10:58,002
Where is Patrick?

767
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:01,100
He rasied both his hands.

768
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,078
Where has he gone?

769
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,779
Alright.

770
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:17,019
Singapore.

771
01:11:19,618 --> 01:11:24,033
Worried about Singapore. There is no Centre in Singapore.

772
01:11:24,054 --> 01:11:25,134
Yet. Alright?

773
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:31,180
Come along Patrick. So which one?

774
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:32,475
It is for which?

775
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:33,743
Toronto?

776
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,393
Alright, for Toronto.

777
01:11:36,394 --> 01:11:41,091
But we should have one for Malaysia, it would be good idea.

778
01:11:41,078 --> 01:11:44,100
Come along. Where is he?

779
01:11:57,832 --> 01:12:00,930
Have you got a plate?

780
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,261
Have you got a plate?

781
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,591
So now,

782
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:16,645
Give me one more plate.

783
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:19,827
For whom?

784
01:12:21,657 --> 01:12:22,697
We sent them inside.

785
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,720
May God bless you.

786
01:12:36,256 --> 01:12:39,323
So you may sing the song.

787
01:12:47,965 --> 01:12:52,211
Let's have the carols first. Let's have the carols

788
01:12:58,364 --> 01:13:00,835
It's good? Very beautiful.

789
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:10,020
Mother we've prepared a couple of other songs for You before the carols.

790
01:13:10,046 --> 01:13:14,238
Alright, let's have it, Let's have the songs.

791
01:13:14,309 --> 01:13:19,185
Give me that, give me to read.

792
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:26,307
Oh, you know the words of this one Mother, the song from the Heart.

793
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,881
Give him to read also. Let him see.

794
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:47,465
So I know the song I think, so now let's have it.

795
01:13:47,572 --> 01:13:49,942
Oh I see!

796
01:16:14,626 --> 01:16:17,822
May God bless you. Beautiful!

797
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:42,961
Give one to the Indians also, they should see.

798
01:20:04,337 --> 01:20:14,362
Beautiful.

799
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:16,032
Very beautiful.

800
01:20:16,389 --> 01:20:21,765
that was such a big area, so many names.

801
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:28,984
Thanks Mother, by the time we get to the end of the Indian Tour, we'll get it right.

802
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:38,604
Alright, thank you very much.

803
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:41,832
Beautiful

804
01:20:43,435 --> 01:20:49,577
Not only that it's composed so well, rendered so well. Beautiful.

805
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:56,149
May God bless you.

806
01:23:32,533 --> 01:23:33,792
Beautiful.

807
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:38,375
Composition is beautiful, who's done the composition?

808
01:23:39,944 --> 01:23:43,404
Ahh, great! Thank you very much.

809
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,801
May God bless you.

810
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:03,689
People might find it a little bit faster then the normally given singing it with the piano

811
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:14,157
but when people sing it without the piano, it tends to be slower, but this is, I think, about the tempo that it was intended to be sung.

812
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,582
William Blake composed here.

813
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:59,314
Great promise. Thank you very much, again.

814
01:26:59,935 --> 01:27:02,042
May God bless you.

815
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:14,097
So now, what is next?

816
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:25,951
We can have a few bhajans. Let's sing some bhajans and then we'll have carols,

817
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:31,631
because he was born at twelve. So it's His time.

818
01:28:26,246 --> 01:28:32,149
Who's the leader?  Ah, sing some Marathi songs. They'll be happy.

819
01:28:33,018 --> 01:28:35,788
Let's see, we'll have to sing later on.

820
01:37:41,497 --> 01:37:42,997
May God bless you.

821
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:45,127
Great. One better than the other.

822
01:42:46,951 --> 01:42:49,189
May God bless you.

823
01:42:58,229 --> 01:43:05,310
We wanted to make some fire for you to celebrate Christmas.

824
01:43:05,327 --> 01:43:07,746
Where would you like to do it?

825
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:09,707
That side?

826
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:14,399
Two doors down Mother.

827
01:43:17,386 --> 01:43:18,827
Two doors down.

828
01:43:24,759 --> 01:43:27,469
(A well known False Guru had an ashram close by)

829
01:43:30,073 --> 01:43:31,715
John, that's already done.

830
01:44:00,326 --> 01:44:05,527
Now where shall we have it? That side or this side?

831
01:44:07,912 --> 01:44:11,493
On my right? Already done?

832
01:44:15,345 --> 01:44:21,020
So let's start singing the carols now, because the light has been lit.

833
01:44:21,805 --> 01:44:22,777
Where?

834
01:44:24,707 --> 01:44:25,564
Pick one.

835
01:44:54,536 --> 01:44:57,073
Where is the host?

836
01:45:12,404 --> 01:45:14,684
I can't follow your American.

837
01:45:19,094 --> 01:45:21,724
Come here, I didn't hear you.

838
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:09,820
Mahrotra

839
01:46:09,841 --> 01:46:12,770
Let him come, otherwise we will not start.

840
01:46:19,231 --> 01:46:20,641
So we'll sing the song.

841
01:46:57,838 --> 01:47:02,136
So we'll sing some carols 'til he comes here, then we'll cut the cake.

842
01:47:05,256 --> 01:47:10,237
First of all let's sing the carols until he comes for the cake. He has to cut the cake.

843
01:47:25,922 --> 01:47:30,564
Now you sing soon, because twelve o'clock, they'll have a big show.

844
01:47:31,984 --> 01:47:32,984
Let's start.

845
01:51:34,528 --> 01:51:36,645
Beautiful!

846
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:49,051
Think of the cake it's twelve o'clock and then we will be singing all these things around the fire.

847
01:51:49,072 --> 01:51:51,576
Alright. It's going to be twelve.

848
01:51:51,586 --> 01:51:54,805
So Mr and Mrs Mahrotra should cut it.

849
01:51:54,813 --> 01:51:59,948
Come along. This is their day. Come along

850
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:08,988
This is from Mataji. Alright.

851
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:18,664
So then we have to sing a song to him. Alright? To Mahrotra.

852
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:09,713
This is for Mr Mahrotra and Mr Jolly. Alright.

853
01:53:14,056 --> 01:53:30,938
Now we can have the rest of the carols. Plus they have got a lot of these green for celebrations, of... so better finish it fast.

854
01:53:32,537 --> 01:53:34,507
And then we are going to have the real ones.

855
01:53:34,507 --> 01:53:38,783
Alright, so go ahead fast.

856
01:53:41,479 --> 01:53:44,090
How many there are?

857
01:53:45,509 --> 01:53:47,780
Alright let's have it.

858
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,411
Wonderful!

859
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:03,819
Great, let's have another one now.

860
01:58:19,323 --> 01:58:21,122
My voice is........

861
01:58:21,143 --> 01:58:22,472
not singing.

862
01:58:23,603 --> 01:58:26,233
Alright, let's have another one.

863
02:01:25,533 --> 02:01:26,252
I did it.

864
02:01:27,974 --> 02:01:31,594
That's so good

865
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:39,118
You see my voice has gone off, but still I'm trying.

866
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:01,867
Now I'll sing a little.

867
02:03:52,337 --> 02:03:56,720
Nice. Beautiful, this one is a very beautiful one, isn't it?

868
02:03:56,831 --> 02:04:01,661
Giving you the serenity of the time.

869
02:05:54,345 --> 02:05:57,666
Very beautiful, very tender

870
02:05:57,667 --> 02:05:59,586
movement is beautiful.

871
02:06:04,944 --> 02:06:08,247
You've got all of them?

872
02:06:13,042 --> 02:06:14,662
How many?

873
02:06:14,685 --> 02:06:16,533
Now let's have it.

874
02:09:56,984 --> 02:10:00,055
Let's see that. Celebrate your Christmas.

875
02:10:06,044 --> 02:10:13,000
Now you all can burn, all of you there's for all those who want to venture. Not me!

876
02:10:13,706 --> 02:10:19,679
What's that? It's from far off. The kings have brought the presents.

877
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:32,649
Is this from England?

878
02:10:34,043 --> 02:10:39,993
England the Heart, alright. Thank you very much.

879
02:10:52,077 --> 02:10:55,854
Mr Hari, has brought all these crackers for you.

880
02:11:02,162 --> 02:11:04,533
Beautiful thing.

881
02:11:04,993 --> 02:11:10,582
Now the crackers are not yet started. These are just... What do you call them?

882
02:11:11,372 --> 02:11:12,622
Fireworks.

883
02:11:12,761 --> 02:11:17,652
Only general name is fireworks, but particular is what?

884
02:11:19,721 --> 02:11:20,662
Roman Candle?

885
02:11:20,671 --> 02:11:28,051
No this called as the "Anaar.' It's a tree of pomegranate.

886
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:53,747
On behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, who are Shri Mataji's children and saints,

887
02:11:53,779 --> 02:11:56,988
I'd like to thank and congratulate Shri Mataji

888
02:11:56,987 --> 02:12:02,197
for the moment when as Mary Maha Lakshmi, She unfurled the Heavens

889
02:12:02,203 --> 02:12:05,653
and through Her Immaculate Womb gave birth to the Omkar

890
02:12:05,747 --> 02:12:07,854
The Word of God.

891
02:12:09,225 --> 02:12:12,283
Thank you very much.

892
02:12:19,909 --> 02:12:22,279
Wah, wah, wah!

893
02:12:25,122 --> 02:12:29,712
The package is all ruined because one package was lost in the aeroplane

894
02:12:33,453 --> 02:12:35,122
Thank you very much.

895
02:12:38,067 --> 02:12:40,479
There's now going to be one, many more.

896
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:45,581
Nice for English to laugh. Come along.

897
02:12:46,279 --> 02:12:48,828
You go now and do huge one.

898
02:12:48,831 --> 02:12:51,349
Malcolm and these never laugh.

899
02:12:54,734 --> 02:12:56,966
We're going to have much bigger ones.

900
02:12:56,957 --> 02:13:01,256
Come along, Malcolm come along. You must learn how to burn.

901
02:13:01,256 --> 02:13:03,618
English should try doing this,

902
02:13:03,698 --> 02:13:06,154
they never talk.

903
02:13:40,465 --> 02:13:42,725
Go and try.

904
02:13:42,715 --> 02:13:44,073
You must learn how to do it.

905
02:14:10,443 --> 02:14:13,273
Come along, try some Natalie.

906
02:14:15,284 --> 02:14:17,528
You can watch it.

907
02:14:18,778 --> 02:14:20,398
You can pull?

908
02:14:23,417 --> 02:14:24,408
Be careful.

909
02:14:26,215 --> 02:14:28,604
Take some more. Robert take it.

910
02:14:30,515 --> 02:14:32,975
Come along boys, alright?. All the boys

911
02:14:35,076 --> 02:14:36,583
All the boys.

912
02:14:36,564 --> 02:14:38,850
Try your luck.

913
02:14:52,750 --> 02:14:56,462
In this area no bhoots are going to remain anymore.

914
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:23,661
From Melissa. It's from Melissa.

915
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:28,091
From Melissa?

916
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:31,001
Alright put her name down.

917
02:15:31,122 --> 02:15:33,162
Put it down her name.

918
02:15:55,567 --> 02:15:58,989
Write it down. Your name has been written down?

919
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,569
Alright. Thank you very much.

920
02:16:04,695 --> 02:16:06,195
You have not got it as yet?

921
02:16:06,197 --> 02:16:09,188
You haven't got one? Please have it.

922
02:16:26,667 --> 02:16:29,176
Such a big one!  Too much.

923
02:17:23,813 --> 02:17:26,040
No bhoots are going to remain in this area.

924
02:17:26,163 --> 02:17:29,474
All Rajneesh bhoots are going to run away.

925
02:17:36,779 --> 02:17:38,761
Keep away!

926
02:17:56,956 --> 02:18:00,236
It's a translation of the  Bhagavad Gita in Italian.

927
02:18:00,236 --> 02:18:00,949
You did it?

928
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:01,680
Yes Mother.

929
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,119
Oh great!

930
02:18:04,279 --> 02:18:09,761
Great. I think this you must keep it in my room.  Keep it with you.

931
02:18:24,689 --> 02:18:26,139
A very big one.

932
02:18:33,084 --> 02:18:34,820
Such a laughing bunch.

933
02:18:43,861 --> 02:18:46,191
Don't keep too near.

934
02:18:51,259 --> 02:18:54,495
That's great thing they have in India, isn't it, to celebrate.

935
02:18:55,736 --> 02:18:58,619
This is the place... country where you can really celebrate things.

936
02:18:58,709 --> 02:19:00,835
Look at this beautiful thing.

937
02:19:01,636 --> 02:19:04,286
What nice things.

938
02:19:10,193 --> 02:19:12,245
Are you happy now?

939
02:19:16,465 --> 02:19:18,584
I hope you are comfortable, both of you.

940
02:19:18,623 --> 02:19:21,453
This is not such a comfortable place.

941
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:25,379
Such a big one actually.

942
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:26,826
Terrific people.

943
02:19:32,335 --> 02:19:36,699
In this area no bhoots are going to remain any more.

944
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:40,341
Already he's not been.

945
02:19:40,352 --> 02:19:42,174
You see he's finished.

946
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:43,692
Yes what's this?

947
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:46,021
From where?

948
02:19:46,049 --> 02:19:47,360
From Vienna.

949
02:19:47,430 --> 02:19:48,760
Thank you.

950
02:19:50,588 --> 02:19:51,843
So beautiful!

951
02:19:54,445 --> 02:19:56,825
Keep away from fire.

952
02:19:58,476 --> 02:20:00,183
Keep away from fire.

953
02:20:01,766 --> 02:20:02,906
Don't throw.

954
02:20:05,987 --> 02:20:09,519
There's something on near the fire and it will burst out suddenly.

955
02:20:14,608 --> 02:20:16,788
Use a barge pole.

956
02:20:19,358 --> 02:20:20,688
There are so many more.

957
02:20:22,132 --> 02:20:23,346
Take all this.

958
02:20:26,563 --> 02:20:29,183
Just take this.

959
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:43,421
Just take that. It's tremendous.

960
02:20:43,474 --> 02:20:45,611
From your Brighton Sahaja Yogis

961
02:20:45,611 --> 02:20:46,652
What is it?

962
02:20:46,709 --> 02:20:48,143
I don't know.

963
02:21:08,958 --> 02:21:10,236
Tremendous!

964
02:21:11,988 --> 02:21:15,331
So many he brought. So sweet of him.

965
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:17,581
You burnt yourself?

966
02:21:19,246 --> 02:21:21,147
Come here.

967
02:21:31,316 --> 02:21:35,263
There are so many more. Take all these.

968
02:21:39,081 --> 02:21:42,574
You burnt yourself. Be careful.

969
02:21:42,654 --> 02:21:44,984
Mother everyone will start burning.

970
02:21:46,941 --> 02:21:47,842
Everybody's what?

971
02:21:47,952 --> 02:21:51,612
Everyone will start to burn themselves when they know that you will...

972
02:22:02,056 --> 02:22:03,834
There's so many are there too.

973
02:22:08,875 --> 02:22:10,795
They are called as Tartadi.

974
02:22:10,896 --> 02:22:15,459
You see all of them have names in India. It's very popular thing.

975
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:55,772
Sahasrara

976
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:29,129
There is hot tea for all of you.

977
02:23:30,262 --> 02:23:32,932
You can go and have your hot tea.

978
02:25:35,521 --> 02:25:37,308
Very good.

979
02:25:53,958 --> 02:25:56,179
Be careful!

980
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:12,831
Beautiful!

981
02:27:03,994 --> 02:27:07,384
That's a common thing. So many must be there. Find these.

982
02:27:11,664 --> 02:27:14,938
All of you can do as the girls are doing.

983
02:27:17,828 --> 02:27:20,609
Just try. There will be many.

984
02:27:21,889 --> 02:27:25,519
They have brought, but I don't know by what.

985
02:27:27,254 --> 02:27:30,023
There, there Phuljhadi. These are.

986
02:27:32,103 --> 02:27:34,873
Below that, just see what this is.

987
02:27:42,835 --> 02:27:45,546
Here they are.

988
02:27:45,667 --> 02:27:49,038
These are something else. Let me see.

989
02:27:53,556 --> 02:27:54,756
Chukhas

990
02:27:55,447 --> 02:27:59,018
These are chukhas, these go up.

991
02:28:04,676 --> 02:28:06,496
Ah this is nice.

992
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:14,066
Ahh these are the ones. These are atom bombs.

993
02:28:15,495 --> 02:28:18,227
Very big one. Very big.

994
02:28:19,156 --> 02:28:23,046
One by one, not to be thrown together.

995
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:32,040
These are also...

996
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:33,440
These are also the same.

997
02:28:35,370 --> 02:28:37,139
There are so many more.

998
02:28:38,132 --> 02:28:40,231
This is the same.

999
02:28:40,961 --> 02:28:43,268
It's the same. Yes. See that.

1000
02:29:08,593 --> 02:29:11,995
This one is to be watched from close quarters.

1001
02:29:12,095 --> 02:29:15,296
The one is to be watched from very close quarters.

1002
02:29:17,308 --> 02:29:19,827
You all have to have your tea there.

1003
02:29:19,923 --> 02:29:22,433
But are there more like these?

1004
02:30:32,197 --> 02:30:38,836
You can bend it and you can move it over, bent like a chakra.

1005
02:30:40,916 --> 02:30:44,308
You bend on the side and then you can move it like a chakra.

1006
02:30:46,593 --> 02:30:47,823
Like me!

1007
02:30:47,913 --> 02:30:51,102
You must bend it at the end.

1008
02:31:13,536 --> 02:31:20,495
Nylon. Be careful with nylon saris. Nylon saris be careful that's all.

1009
02:31:27,816 --> 02:31:29,927
This one is something interesting.

1010
02:31:29,927 --> 02:31:30,836
Burnt?

1011
02:31:30,927 --> 02:31:31,888
No!

1012
02:31:34,332 --> 02:31:35,935
I know his tricks.

1013
02:31:36,611 --> 02:31:39,584
Alright bring that plate here. Gregoire, bring that plate.

1014
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:43,093
This plate!

1015
02:31:50,558 --> 02:31:53,977
Matchstick you bring. No, No, you bring that.

1016
02:31:56,093 --> 02:31:58,189
And you put it to this one.

1017
02:32:02,689 --> 02:32:03,959
Is there a matchstick?

1018
02:32:15,004 --> 02:32:16,352
Put the matchstick here.

1019
02:32:20,549 --> 02:32:23,111
See this one Gregoire is interesting,

1020
02:32:23,252 --> 02:32:26,342
You don't get all these in your country?

1021
02:32:26,549 --> 02:32:28,611
I've never seen any.

1022
02:32:28,653 --> 02:32:31,093
Next time you come we will do. We'll organise something.

1023
02:32:31,153 --> 02:32:32,174
Alright.

1024
02:32:38,147 --> 02:32:40,718
Alright you burn one of those.

1025
02:32:40,761 --> 02:32:44,218
You burn one of those. What do you call them?

1026
02:32:45,629 --> 02:32:46,299
Sparklers

1027
02:32:47,209 --> 02:32:49,752
You call them. We call them Phuljhadi.

1028
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:08,590
If one starts burning it is sufficient.

1029
02:33:09,775 --> 02:33:11,566
Now you just touch it.

1030
02:33:11,566 --> 02:33:12,996
Now see!

1031
02:33:23,583 --> 02:33:25,054
Touch others.

1032
02:33:30,969 --> 02:33:32,039
Touch others.

1033
02:33:36,759 --> 02:33:38,365
You must touch.

1034
02:33:39,748 --> 02:33:40,459
Hot part.

1035
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:45,050
Now, done, done, done.

1036
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:46,451
That's it?

1037
02:33:52,877 --> 02:33:53,888
Now the other.

1038
02:33:56,174 --> 02:33:58,745
Here now on other side.

1039
02:34:03,933 --> 02:34:06,430
I hope this thing goes away.

1040
02:34:11,290 --> 02:34:13,290
It's interesting isn't it?

1041
02:34:16,227 --> 02:34:17,780
It's called as snake.

1042
02:34:22,075 --> 02:34:25,799
Very strange they are. There are stranger things available.

1043
02:34:36,058 --> 02:34:39,183
Another one. There's one still left now.

1044
02:34:51,441 --> 02:34:52,885
One more I think.

1045
02:34:56,895 --> 02:35:01,700
There are so many now in this one. You can burn it on the ground. Go!

1046
02:35:07,129 --> 02:35:08,653
Go and burn it.

1047
02:35:09,191 --> 02:35:12,290
It's very interesting. Show it to everyone. Go.

1048
02:35:12,833 --> 02:35:15,299
They are all the snakes.

1049
02:35:17,773 --> 02:35:20,450
If you want to eat snake you can have.

1050
02:35:21,254 --> 02:35:24,644
Mother I have got one swollen finger.

1051
02:35:46,393 --> 02:35:47,813
It was great fun.

1052
02:35:51,027 --> 02:35:54,287
Go and have your tea. Tea's served over in the stalls there.

1053
02:35:54,897 --> 02:35:57,677
All can go and have some tea there.

1054
02:36:11,415 --> 02:36:15,316
It was very enjoyable, a real Christmas.

1055
02:36:15,349 --> 02:36:17,438
So Happy Christmas to you.

1056
02:36:19,487 --> 02:36:22,337
Thank you very much.

1057
02:36:41,533 --> 02:36:46,913
Such cold hands. I thought what's crawling up my feet

1058
02:36:48,047 --> 02:36:52,940
It's Sahaja Yogi's hands. Great.

1059
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:56,931
How was that? Good. Wonderful!

1060
02:36:58,763 --> 02:37:01,647
What's the matter? What are you wearing?

1061
02:37:01,658 --> 02:37:04,058
I've got a fever Mother.

1062
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,190
Good.

1063
02:37:58,836 --> 02:38:01,457
Alright. You're alright now.

1064
02:38:08,816 --> 02:38:10,788
You want some medicines?

1065
02:38:13,344 --> 02:38:15,236
I'll give you some tonight.

1066
02:38:22,733 --> 02:38:24,450
Wonderful it was.

1067
02:38:48,913 --> 02:38:53,781
So, Derek, what do you say of this?

1068
02:38:53,852 --> 02:38:58,143
So sweet of Hari to bring all these things down here, for you to celebrate.

1069
02:38:58,173 --> 02:39:04,710
Now we've done with everything.  Are you sure there isn't... nothing here?

1070
02:39:16,252 --> 02:39:19,788
This one you have to put it in the room, all this.

1071
02:39:24,379 --> 02:39:29,987
In this country, nobody is going to say anything, "Why are you making noise?" Or anything.

1072
02:39:29,994 --> 02:39:33,638
Nothing, you can do what you like.

1073
02:39:49,913 --> 02:39:52,932
Did you see the snake?

1074
02:40:03,412 --> 02:40:05,388
See the snake coming out.

1075
02:40:14,147 --> 02:40:17,076
Here we have very large one. Very big, huge.

1076
02:40:22,108 --> 02:40:30,102
They used to get it from, I think Japan. Now they have started making their own.

1077
02:41:03,281 --> 02:41:08,772
Just a... see making you happy.

1078
02:41:22,592 --> 02:41:24,379
It was a good idea.

1079
02:41:33,903 --> 02:41:35,710
Don't go near it.

1080
02:41:36,191 --> 02:41:40,674
Don't go near it. Throw it from distance.

1081
02:41:45,933 --> 02:41:47,807
Beautiful!

1082
02:42:04,188 --> 02:42:07,773
Now those who would like to...

1083
02:42:07,870 --> 02:42:13,722
just... Oh God! Still working.

1084
02:42:35,833 --> 02:42:37,683
Finished now?

1085
02:42:49,879 --> 02:42:56,268
So it was a good idea, everybody liked it; this saree?

1086
02:42:56,279 --> 02:43:02,486
The designer, they did verify it.  Handmade, done by hand.

1087
02:43:28,393 --> 02:43:32,157
Now this is the one who has given us, let's sing one for him.

1088
02:44:23,545 --> 02:44:26,075
So nice of She to have arranged it.

1089
02:44:28,271 --> 02:44:32,262
He! He's the one who has arranged all these things you see,

1090
02:44:32,281 --> 02:44:37,167
for killing all the rakshasas of this place.

1091
02:44:46,930 --> 02:44:49,209
He's enjoying it very much here.

1092
02:44:51,858 --> 02:44:53,486
He did. He's enjoying it.

1093
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:02,260
So good morning to all of you.

1094
02:45:03,671 --> 02:45:18,126
You better all sleep. Tomorrow morning you have to go. If you want to have a little bit of that, then have a little fomentation if you want.

1095
02:45:18,138 --> 02:45:22,236
And then you can sleep off.

1096
02:45:47,558 --> 02:45:49,549
Is the fire worrying you?

1097
02:45:49,549 --> 02:45:54,025
No, no I'm just thinking<br>that, once it is over...

1098
02:45:54,016 --> 02:45:55,808
The lawn?

1099
02:45:56,198 --> 02:46:02,790
Lawn doesn't mind anything, but once it is over then.

1100
02:46:03,709 --> 02:46:10,379
It's alright. There's no danger to anyone. You can tell the caterer that you are leaving the fire like that.

1101
02:46:11,870 --> 02:46:14,391
That he can look after.

1102
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:23,490
Some of you have to carry these things.

1103
02:46:30,727 --> 02:46:32,332
Thank you very much all of you.
