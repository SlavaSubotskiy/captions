00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:14,193
Guru Puja, July 12th, 1998

2
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:21,447
Cabella Ligure, Italy

3
00:03:54,631 --> 00:04:04,396
Today, we have assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

4
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:13,497
The word "guru" comes from

5
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:19,599
"the one which is magnetic,

6
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,294
the person who is magnetic";

7
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:31,754
the one which attracts the attention of the seekers

8
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:37,247
is the guru. Also it means

9
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:42,599
the heaviness, or you can say,

10
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,982
a person who is very steady,

11
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:57,429
who is very deep, who has the knowledge,

12
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,577
and who can act like the Mother Earth.

13
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:12,443
For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth

14
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:16,123
also is called as magnetic,

15
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:20,568
but in Sanskrit is "Gurutwa karshan,"

16
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:25,888
means "the attraction

17
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,107
of the heaviness of the Mother Earth."

18
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:36,599
But actually it is

19
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,318
a power of the Mother Earth that makes us stand

20
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,920
properly on our legs when it is rotating

21
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,443
with such a tremendous speed,

22
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:57,873
otherwise we would be all thrown away.

23
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:01,318
With that velocity that She is moving,

24
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:12,579
we are still attached or we are one in our balance,

25
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,243
is only because She has gravity.

26
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:25,102
This gravity has to be in a guru.

27
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:31,321
Gravity means

28
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:41,166
a kind of a serious understanding of oneself

29
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:46,830
and one's own responsibilities.

30
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:52,111
So a guru has to be very steady.

31
00:06:52,312 --> 00:07:01,139
In these modern times, people are very mobile,

32
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,745
all the time agitated,

33
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:09,558
all the time getting disturbed.

34
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,136
With small things happening here and there, they get disturbed.

35
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:19,581
They meet people who are not of any quality,

36
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:22,214
then they get disturbed.

37
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:26,269
These disturbing qualities

38
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,746
come from our deficiency in our gravity.

39
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:37,230
A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed,

40
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:40,378
neither get excited,

41
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,878
nor get overly enthusiastic,

42
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,800
nor is he very sad or unhappy.

43
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,120
So he's in the center,

44
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:56,495
he's in the center of his being.

45
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:01,253
But how do we become the guru?

46
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:05,730
That is very important for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

47
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:09,035
Many have felt that they are gurus,

48
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:12,855
they have tried to behave in a funny manner,

49
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:17,027
and have lost their guru position.

50
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,735
First and foremost thing for Sahaja Yogis,

51
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:26,532
it is important that they must have introspection,

52
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,798
they must watch themselves.

53
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:35,306
If a person runs about

54
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:39,243
changing because a fashion has come,

55
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:44,384
because people have suppressed them, or have asked them;

56
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:50,743
just to please people of cheap values,

57
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:58,514
if a person changes, then he cannot be a guru.

58
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,631
He has to station himself

59
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:08,170
properly on the values of Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:12,389
Without introspection you will not know,

61
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,756
you will never remember what you have done wrong,

62
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:23,303
nor will you think of what you have to do right.

63
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:31,160
But that is only possible if you go on improving yourself.

64
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,968
First and foremost thing is,

65
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,429
all the great saints have praised their guru.

66
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,156
For example, we have a very great saint,

67
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,406
Gyaneshwara, in India.

68
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:51,140
He's written a complete chapter about the guru.

69
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:55,210
In English they have translated it as "preceptor" -

70
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,804
guru is the preceptor -

71
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,460
and what he has done is a great thing.

72
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:05,538
He says you are not to challenge the guru,

73
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:09,007
otherwise you can never become a guru;

74
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,632
for name's sake you might be, but you are not.

75
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,788
Secondly, you can never misbehave.

76
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:20,601
You can never be rude, arrogant,

77
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:25,499
and you cannot show your temper to a guru.

78
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,348
If that is so, that means you are not a guru,

79
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:37,884
you are still on a very low level personality.

80
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,864
It is very clearly said

81
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:47,702
that if you try to say against other gurus

82
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:51,843
who are real gurus, who are very high caliber,

83
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:57,538
that also, then you are not a guru.

84
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:02,835
But I would say that you all have got now vibrations,

85
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:06,640
you all have got vibratory awareness.

86
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,445
When you have vibratory awareness,

87
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:14,343
you are capable of finding out about everyone.

88
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:17,976
Now you need not talk about

89
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,773
your own understanding of a person,

90
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,828
but try to face that person directly,

91
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,281
and tell that person, "This is the problem,"

92
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,172
and ask him to change.

93
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:37,195
But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other gurus had.

94
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,258
Other gurus were very, very strict.

95
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,367
They used to carry a stick in their hand, a big stick

96
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:50,258
which they would use for walking or for hitting their disciples.

97
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:56,054
They used to hit their disciples in such a bad manner

98
00:11:56,255 --> 00:12:04,355
that the disciple was literally frightened of the guru.

99
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:10,602
I'll give you an example of a guru I came across.

100
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:16,649
One fellow was there in India

101
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,383
who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini,

102
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:29,485
and he said that "My guru has sent me word

103
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:35,133
that Adi Shakti's going to come and stay with you. Is it true?"

104
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:38,852
She said, "Yes, She's going to stay with me. So what?"

105
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:42,540
He said, "My guru has told me

106
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,493
that 'You go and request Her,

107
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:49,462
and if She could come to our ashram.'"

108
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:52,735
She said, "I'll ask Mataji, I don't know."

109
00:12:52,936 --> 00:13:03,121
This fellow came to a program and he saw Me, a housewife.

110
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:06,566
He said, "This cannot be that Guru."

111
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:13,379
But when I came in, he saw, and when I did Self Realization,

112
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,418
that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he was so surprised

113
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:22,316
and he prostrated himself before Me.

114
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:25,659
Now, his guru was living in Amarnath,

115
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:35,994
is a very famous religious place in the Himalayas.

116
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:40,541
And this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath.

117
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:47,279
So he asked Me, "Mother, will You come to my ashram?"

118
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,037
I said, "Why not?" Because these gurus in the ancient time

119
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:55,725
never used to leave their seat, they call takia -

120
00:13:55,926 --> 00:14:00,264
means "the pillow" - they never left their takia.

121
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,787
I said, "All right, I don't mind. I'll come to you,

122
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,952
to your ashram."

123
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:08,179
So he's just keeping quiet all the while.

124
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,248
So I went there, this guru fell at My Feet,

125
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,701
and he was very, very respectful;

126
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:22,232
and then we came back home.

127
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:25,662
So this fellow started telling Me, "If You don't tell my guru,

128
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:30,857
I would like to tell You that I have got a very bad Agnya.

129
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:34,318
Can You cure, Mother?" I said, "Why not? I will."

130
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,435
So I went back to this guru again, and I said,

131
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:41,185
"Why didn't you cure his Agnya?"

132
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:45,076
He said, "Why? Why should I cure? Who cured my Agnya?

133
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:49,662
I worked out myself. I had to introspect, find out,

134
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:53,756
and I cured my own Agnya, and why should I cure his Agnya?

135
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:59,475
Let him plod, let him work, let him get to this.

136
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:06,061
Otherwise he will be a spoilt man."

137
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:09,506
I was quite surprised. And he said,

138
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,850
"You do it because You are a Mother. You are nothing but love,

139
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:18,873
and that's why You are doing it, all this, for others.

140
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:27,231
But not me! No guru will open the Agnya of his disciples."

141
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,669
I said, "Then why are you a guru?"

142
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,440
He said, "Because we have to guide them.

143
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:57,468
And if they have their Agnya badly cut out,

144
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:03,757
if their attention is not all right, I'm not bothered about it.

145
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,835
It is their duty to introspect and find,

146
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:11,233
and climb the ladder which I've put before them.

147
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:16,069
So I'm a guru, I can only give them the ladder to climb up.

148
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,038
It is they who should work very hard,

149
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,944
it is they who should introspect,

150
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,733
it is they who should correct themselves.

151
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:28,616
Why should I help them to such an extent

152
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:31,944
that you open their Agnya?"

153
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,746
I said, "All right, you allow Me to open his Agnya,

154
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:35,947
if you don't mind."

155
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:38,277
He said, "You are a Mother, do what You like;

156
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:42,019
I have nothing to say. If You want to do that,

157
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,300
You'll spoil him, You'll spoil him.

158
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,933
Let him do it on his own,

159
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,699
otherwise You'll be spoiling him."

160
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,840
I said, "As you are also spoiling,

161
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,168
that you don't open anybody's Agnyas, yes?"

162
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:02,410
"But whatever position I've achieved is a permanent one."

163
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:05,598
So I opened his Agnya.

164
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,332
Then this fellow, on his way he told Me that

165
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:15,809
his guru came back "and he put me hanging on a well.

166
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,848
And he used to every time lower the rope

167
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,598
so I would go into the water. Ten times he did it."

168
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,668
But I said, "Why did he do such a cruel thing?"

169
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,770
He said, "Because he found me smoking a cigarette."

170
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,598
My goodness!

171
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,384
So I asked his guru, I said,

172
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:38,907
"Why do you do such horrible things to your disciples?"

173
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:42,930
He said, "Otherwise, if you don't do like that

174
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:46,266
they will never rise, they'll never come up.

175
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,657
You go on forgiving them and the more you forgive,

176
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:54,196
the worse they become, and they will show no ascent at all.

177
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,969
So you have to be very strict with them.

178
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,985
Please don't spoil them all the time."

179
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:04,423
I was really surprised. How could he say so?

180
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:09,829
"You see," he said, "Mother, if you give everything free,

181
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,876
you give them everything so easily,

182
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:16,095
they will never value their self-respect,

183
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,954
they will never value their Self Realization."

184
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:24,345
I said, "It's not so. You have to give them a chance.

185
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:28,212
You have to allow them to rise,

186
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:33,579
and to allow them to become something.

187
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,936
Like Mother Earth, what She does,

188
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:41,923
She sprouts the seeds, then the trees come up.

189
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,488
Then after that She gives them the fruits,

190
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:50,597
and She sees that the fruits are ripened; all does She do."

191
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:57,620
But he said, "But they are not trees, You see, they're human beings,

192
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:02,229
and they have freedom to become devils also."

193
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,549
I said, "All right, if there are devils, I can manage them.

194
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,346
You just see how I can manage them. And if they are devils

195
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:14,494
they will remain devils, you cannot change them."

196
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,885
So he argued with Me,

197
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,354
and when he met Sahaja Yogis he asked them,

198
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:23,893
"How many of you are willing to give life for Shri Mataji?

199
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:28,838
Do you know what She has given you?" They said, "Yes, we do."

200
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,861
So they came to Me and told, "Mother,

201
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:35,775
he wanted us to give life for You." I said,

202
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:39,869
"There's no necessity, it's not necessary;

203
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,494
because he used to ask his disciples, perhaps."

204
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:49,142
And then I met many like him who were very strict gurus,

205
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:53,189
complete obedience was needed; complete humility,

206
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,306
complete surrender was needed.

207
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:58,283
A word against the guru was not tolerated,

208
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,650
but even you could not answer,

209
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:05,158
you could not show any temper to a guru.

210
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,252
Now I have met people who are like that sometimes,

211
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:12,565
then I stopped talking to them, that's it.

212
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,338
If they want to improve, they can improve;

213
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,401
they don't want to improve, you cannot force them to improve.

214
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:20,846
But according to these gurus,

215
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,047
there should be a great fear in their mind,

216
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:26,533
that they should be so frightened

217
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:32,038
that they should behave themselves.

218
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:36,080
Now we expect so much from the guru,

219
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:40,424
that he's your father, mother,

220
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,487
he's a friend, everything to you.

221
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:49,870
He is a pure person who just wants your ascent.

222
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:53,386
He wants to look after you,

223
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:57,980
he wants to guide you, wants to protect you,

224
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:02,863
and takes you to the life of spirituality;

225
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:06,738
and this is the way a guru has to work out.

226
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:12,136
But what is expected of the disciples is even much worse.

227
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:19,991
The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person,

228
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:27,085
he should have a pure desire to become a spiritual person.

229
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,858
If he doesn't have this pure desire,

230
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:35,194
he has some other desires, then absolutely useless.

231
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,686
Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen it,

232
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:41,561
they want to make a name out of themselves,

233
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:44,842
they become great masters of everything,

234
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,405
they want to dominate everything.

235
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:52,022
That is not, that is not important.

236
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:55,085
There are some people who try to make money in Sahaja Yoga:

237
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,866
a way of making money.

238
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,296
That also absolutely wrong; and not only that,

239
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,405
but it's very low level,

240
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:06,882
that you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,179
Then there are people who just come here for some politics.

242
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,812
They go on saying things here and saying things there.

243
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:19,820
All these things are not going to give you any ascent whatsoever.

244
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:25,086
You have come here only to achieve a

245
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:30,922
great life of spirituality, of becoming a guru.

246
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:34,367
Now also this politics business is quite a lot,

247
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:40,633
people try to enjoy the position of a leader,

248
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:46,555
so they try to keep that position in a very special way.

249
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,274
There's no need.

250
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:54,672
If you are a leader because you are a great master,

251
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,227
you will remain. Nobody can challenge you,

252
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:01,726
nobody can dethrone you, and one should not get disturbed

253
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,171
with any such fear.

254
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:10,452
Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which fear doesn't play any part;

255
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:12,679
there's no fear, for you.

256
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,593
Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect.

257
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:22,296
Try to find out, what have you been doing?

258
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:28,896
Are you an, absolutely a humble person?

259
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,507
Do you do whatever is told to you?

260
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:41,023
Supposing I tell somebody just go to, say, some place,

261
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:43,523
he may not go. He'll come and tell Me,

262
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,656
"Mother, You know, this happened, that happened" -

263
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,117
some excuse, he may not go.

264
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,820
But that's not being good.

265
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,325
If you have been told to go to that place,

266
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:57,903
there must be some meaning and you have to go.

267
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,247
You have to obey. If you are not obedient

268
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:06,669
then you cannot become a guru, because if you cannot obey,

269
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,138
how can others obey you?

270
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,763
This obedience is not for any personal gain of the guru,

271
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:16,654
not at all, but for your gain only,

272
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,396
for your education, for your ascent.

273
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:25,529
So if such a view is taken then what happens,

274
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,693
that you start getting all the qualities of a guru.

275
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:35,170
Firstly, a guru cannot be fussy man,

276
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:36,818
first and foremost thing.

277
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,591
"I want this house, I want that thing;

278
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:43,802
I can't like this, I can't like that."

279
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:47,450
If a person who does not know

280
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:51,161
how to get detached from all these habits,

281
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:55,138
he cannot be a guru. How can he ascend?

282
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,372
Of course, I mean, you have to try

283
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:02,020
that you get rid of all these habits.

284
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:05,708
They are funny habits which make you miserable;

285
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:10,130
doesn't make miserable others, as it makes you miserable.

286
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:14,927
No habit should cling to a guru.

287
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:22,099
First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time.

288
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,583
He should not worry about time.

289
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,435
Many-a-times I have seen people,

290
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:33,904
if they have to go to a airport, for example,

291
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,763
something enters into their body,

292
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,552
they become speedy suddenly, everybody.

293
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:42,458
Even if I have to go, I'm going,

294
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,989
then all of them will become speedy,

295
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,075
everybody starts running helter-skelter. Why?

296
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:53,153
I am going, you are not going; but it happens.

297
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,809
Like that, if you tell somebody you have to go to a function

298
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,551
or for some felicitation, people start jumping about,

299
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:05,903
and that's a very modern disease, it was not before.

300
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:11,973
So they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset.

301
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:16,762
But if you go on worrying like that, you don't go beyond time.

302
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:20,871
And when you go beyond time, you control time,

303
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:26,387
time is with you all the time. Whenever you go, it happens.

304
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:29,051
I'll give an example of that.

305
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:33,934
We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down

306
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,934
and she broke her hand, very badly.

307
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:39,576
I was about to leave for America, I was,

308
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:42,045
actually I'd come out of My room.

309
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:43,806
When I saw the child I said,

310
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:48,876
"All right, doesn't matter. I'll cure this child first."

311
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:50,751
They said, "No, Mother, but Your plane!"

312
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:53,689
I said, "It's all right, forget it."

313
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:00,736
So I got the child, treated the child, and she was all right.

314
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:08,064
And after, I think, half-an-hour, I left, I left for the airport.

315
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:10,642
And you'll be amazed to hear

316
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:15,025
that that aeroplane was out of order,

317
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:16,830
which was going to New York.

318
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:20,619
So there's this plane is out of order. Then they said,

319
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,846
"All right, You can go by another plane which goes to Washington,

320
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:28,885
with the same ticket." I said, "Very good idea, give Me that,"

321
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:31,815
and I went by that. So that I reached Washington,

322
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:36,292
which is a very, very nice airport to arrive,

323
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:40,526
because there's no problem of customs,

324
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,799
there's no crowd, nothing.

325
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,877
All people go to New York, I don't know why.

326
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:49,393
They should all go to Washington, it's very surprising.

327
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:54,573
I discovered for Myself, that I wished I had not gone

328
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:59,237
by that horrible plane to go to New York.

329
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,550
Like that everything works out.

330
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:08,448
And the time comes what is good for you.

331
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:13,136
It is such a lot of experience of Mine which I can tell you,

332
00:28:13,337 --> 00:28:18,222
that to worry about time itself is a headache.

333
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:23,300
If you leave it to this divine power and believe in it,

334
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,300
then everything works out for your good.

335
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:36,209
And if it does not, you must know that it is your destiny,

336
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,451
you must accept, you must learn to accept.

337
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,904
Because whatever you have fixed up yourself

338
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:47,029
as something very great, is not.

339
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,513
So what is the greatest thing you have to achieve? -

340
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:52,911
your detachment.

341
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,583
Then you become gunateet:

342
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:59,739
means, as you know, we have three gunas within us.

343
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:07,422
One is, they call is as sattwa guna, is the best.

344
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:11,839
But there are two other gunas which are, as you know,

345
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,089
the left side and right side.

346
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,597
Either you are a right-sided person or a left-sided person.

347
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:26,894
These two gunas within us are of no importance.

348
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:29,871
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

349
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:35,269
then what happens to you? You become over-active.

350
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,972
Over- activity gives you fatigue,

351
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:41,480
gives you all kinds of diseases which you have seen,

352
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:44,043
and you have to cure right side.

353
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,848
Such a person is extremely speedy,

354
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:49,739
he cannot sit in one place for two minutes,

355
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,372
all the time jumping,

356
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:57,036
and he creates problems for himself and his family.

357
00:29:57,237 --> 00:30:02,028
Then the left-sided person,

358
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:05,708
which we call as the tamo guna -

359
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:08,311
the right-sided is rajo guna, and the left-sided

360
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:14,209
is the one which is tamo guna -

361
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,959
"tamo" means darkness, such a man is afraid of darkness,

362
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,326
darkness, everything he is afraid of.

363
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:31,473
But he becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person.

364
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:36,528
He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner,

365
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:41,536
not openly, while the right-sided man is openly a Hitler.

366
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:46,403
But this one, the second one, the one who is called as tamo guni,

367
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:51,294
is the one tries to trouble others very much.

368
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:56,552
Rajo guni has a opinion of his own about everything.

369
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:00,068
When he is so much having his own opinion,

370
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:03,779
he goes on forcing it on to other persons.

371
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,271
But if you see his own life, he is in complete misery.

372
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:12,638
He cannot carry on with people, he cannot talk to people,

373
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,255
and there's a very big gap between himself,

374
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:20,638
his Spirit and his being.

375
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,810
The second type, the tamo gunis, are the ones

376
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,162
who end up with all kinds of diseases.

377
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:30,904
Even the right-sided people get lots of diseases.

378
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,748
But the left ones get it psychosomatic.

379
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:38,131
Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous

380
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:41,787
and not curable by human doctors.

381
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:44,037
So you have to take to Sahaja Yoga.

382
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,685
But again you go to the right or to the left,

383
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:52,701
again right, to the left. This is not a very good attitude,

384
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:58,373
I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas,

385
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:01,517
or you are all the time like a pendulum

386
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,517
moving from left to right, right to left.

387
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:07,439
So you have to be a steady person.

388
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,384
For that, you all have to meditate.

389
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:13,947
I know immediately a person who meditates,

390
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:17,236
and I know who does not meditate.

391
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,431
You will yourself know a person who meditates.

392
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:23,579
It's a question of ten, fifteen minutes,

393
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,884
but that you must do every night and morning,

394
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:32,243
about five minutes' meditation; then you develop your balance,

395
00:32:32,444 --> 00:32:38,585
you develop your tenacity, you develop your own body

396
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:42,796
in such a manner that it can stand lots of nonsense,

397
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:48,054
it can bear lots of things. You don't have then desires left -

398
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:52,367
what food you should eat, when you should eat,

399
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:56,312
whom you should please - nothing of the kind.

400
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:59,468
You yourself become such a sweet person

401
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:03,827
that everybody is pleased, and understand that

402
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:09,647
one has to be like you.

403
00:33:09,848 --> 00:33:13,131
The people see you and you become like a model.

404
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:17,709
People start following you, that means you become a guru.

405
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,178
In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have,

406
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:26,194
of left and right side. Now sattwa gunis are the people

407
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:32,038
who believe in the righteousness, but when they are righteous,

408
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:36,265
they have contempt for others who are not righteous.

409
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:38,992
They go on saying things to such people,

410
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:42,320
so they can develop a kind of a temperament

411
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:46,406
so they become aloof. They can go to Himalayas,

412
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,937
sit there and not to meet anybody; get out of the society,

413
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:53,609
get out of all your relations, everyone,

414
00:33:53,810 --> 00:34:00,398
and just establish yourself as a big guru somewhere.

415
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,789
This kind of also another generation is there,

416
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,844
which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Hardwar.

417
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:13,117
And I told them, "What are you doing here in the Himalayas?"

418
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,437
They said, "We don't want to face human beings.

419
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,414
They're useless people, they're good for nothing.

420
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:21,673
You do anything for them, they go on troubling you.

421
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:25,321
We don't want to be there." So I said, "Why have you become guru?

422
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:30,227
If you cannot manage them, if you cannot

423
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:32,969
get out of the troubles they are giving you

424
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,055
and out of all those things, and remain in your peace,

425
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:39,461
then what's the use of becoming this?"

426
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,523
He said, "We have had enough of it."

427
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:45,273
Some of them were over hundred years of age and all that,

428
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:48,464
but I said, "What's the use? Your life is of no use,

429
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:51,816
you are staying here alone somewhere in the jungles."

430
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:56,332
He said, "The tigers, the snakes, all of them know us,

431
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,207
that we are great; they don't trouble us.

432
00:34:59,408 --> 00:35:01,629
But these human beings are troubling.

433
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,676
If we go down, they'll trouble us and torture us.

434
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:09,285
We don't want to go there because they're very ambitious,

435
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:12,808
or they are very negative.

436
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,113
Something is wrong with the human beings,

437
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,761
none of them have reached a perfect state."

438
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:21,112
So that all that, I was surprised

439
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:26,034
how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us,

440
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:29,440
and be a part and parcel of us.

441
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:33,182
So they said, "All right, Mother, You have come. You are a Mother,

442
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:37,276
You can tolerate all this and You can work it out, but not me.

443
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:40,120
We are out of it, we don't want to go back."

444
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,761
They have lots of powers. They can control the nature,

445
00:35:43,962 --> 00:35:46,054
they can do so many things. But they said,

446
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:51,269
"Easy to control even a snake than to control a human being.

447
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,082
Today they might behave in a particular manner,

448
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,059
suddenly they will become horrible.

449
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,278
You don't know these human beings how uncertain they are,

450
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:01,622
what uncertain quantity they are."

451
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:05,833
I said, "There is a way of putting them right.

452
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:10,153
You first give them Realization. In the light of their Spirit

453
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:13,637
they can see how they are doing wrong things.

454
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,434
Ninety-nine percent people will know what's going wrong with them,

455
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,442
where are they missing the point.

456
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:24,083
They will start seeing themselves.

457
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:28,278
Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly,

458
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,505
and you start changing yourself.

459
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:34,013
There's no introspection actually needed then,

460
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:38,490
when you have your Spirit awakened. You can watch yourself,

461
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:41,865
you can see for yourself clearly,

462
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,904
as soon as

463
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:52,217
you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi."

464
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:56,108
And that is one point one should see,

465
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:59,085
if it has happened to you.

466
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:02,733
If you can see something wrong with you,

467
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:11,250
if you can find out what sort of defects you have,

468
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:16,484
if you can detach yourself from those defects,

469
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:19,453
and if you can understand

470
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,344
that all these attachments and defects and habits

471
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:28,946
are pulling you down, then only you can leave them.

472
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,454
But that only happens when you have

473
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:36,009
this mirror of your Self shining through.

474
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,978
When this light comes to you, you see for yourself

475
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:43,666
what is wrong with you,

476
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:46,213
what is the wrong path you are taking.

477
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:50,713
Overnight you have seen people have given up so many things.

478
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:54,921
Many gross things they give up, but still there are many,

479
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:58,812
I should say, subtle things, which stick on to them.

480
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:03,203
First thing that happens to you is that you start finding

481
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:11,193
what's wrong with your own people of your own nation.

482
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:15,242
I'm amazed, you see, when the English got Realization,

483
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,742
they started telling Me about the English.

484
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:20,094
When Italians got Realization,

485
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:23,563
they started telling Me about the Italians.

486
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:27,844
If you tell the Italians that "You see, this Italian fellow did this like that,"

487
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:30,875
he said, "Italians after all, Mother, what will they do?

488
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:34,328
They're just like this, You know." He himself is an Italian,

489
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,837
but immediately he'll say. Same with the Russians, I have seen,

490
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:41,915
it's very surprising that they start telling you

491
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:45,845
about what's wrong with the Russians or with the Ukrainians,

492
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:49,472
all of them are quite alike. Even Indians, they'll say,

493
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:53,120
"After all this is Indian. You know Indian people how they are,

494
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:57,265
Mother; they are doing like this." I was surprised that

495
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,721
they themselves being Indians,

496
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:02,565
how are they immediately telling Me about the Indians?

497
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:06,331
And many things I have come to know about these countries

498
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:09,761
through the, actually through the Sahaja Yogis only.

499
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:13,014
When the Sahaja Yogis tell Me, I'm amazed

500
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:15,811
that they are not identified with their country,

501
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:18,092
they are not identified with anyone,

502
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:20,936
even their own family they are not identified with.

503
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,405
If they find something wrong, they'll tell Me,

504
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:27,608
"Mother, my father is like that, my mother is like that."

505
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,897
That is how you get detached,

506
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:32,897
when you start seeing and not identified.

507
00:39:33,098 --> 00:39:36,811
If you are not identified with all these things,

508
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:41,772
then you become a free person, you have the freedom.

509
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:45,819
You become a person who is not attached to anyone

510
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,350
because he's your father or she's your mother,

511
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:52,756
or a sister or anyone.

512
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:57,381
This attachment is a very dangerous one also.

513
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:02,115
With the family attachment, we have lost many Sahaja Yogis.

514
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,295
Because their family was funny, they got lost;

515
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:07,240
they couldn't get out of it.

516
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:11,803
We don't say that you detach yourself from family or get out of it,

517
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:15,639
but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to,

518
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,127
and what they are doing. All these subtle understanding

519
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:25,557
about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticize them.

520
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:29,370
You should see for yourself what's wrong with you.

521
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:31,892
You know all these subtleties you criticize,

522
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:34,712
that such a person is such, such a person is such,

523
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:38,915
but you also have the same problems with you.

524
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:43,837
That's why you get detachment only possibly,

525
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:48,900
through this introspection through the mirror of your Spirit.

526
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:53,970
So the spiritual life is very important to a person

527
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:57,486
than anything else on this earth,

528
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,377
because such a person has been seeking,

529
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:04,596
he has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality.

530
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:08,519
And once you know the reality, you don't want to cling onto

531
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,800
something which is not reality.

532
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:16,558
You want to be a person who is above all these things,

533
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:18,535
that you can see all these things.

534
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:20,816
And that is how you can save others

535
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:27,886
who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness,

536
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:32,199
into the ocean of misidentification,

537
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,129
only when you are above these things.

538
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:40,316
But mostly what happens is this, that you are identified,

539
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:44,698
you are identified, "How can I do it? How can I say?"

540
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:48,003
The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread,

541
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:52,355
where there have been people who are not identified with those countries,

542
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:55,175
and think that they have to help

543
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:59,847
all these countrymen to come up, to join them.

544
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:05,199
For that, tremendous patience and love is necessary.

545
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,983
As you know this cosmic power, as they call it,

546
00:42:09,184 --> 00:42:13,866
which they say I'm the source: actually, it is the power of love,

547
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:17,546
of divine love, of pure love.

548
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:22,296
And such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything,

549
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,015
but it acts, it works.

550
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:28,351
For example, if you love somebody, you would not like to do

551
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:32,289
something to displease that person.

552
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,477
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis

553
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:38,485
who do things which I really don't like,

554
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:42,610
but I never show, I just keep quiet.

555
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,516
But normally if a person has love for someone,

556
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:50,086
he wouldn't do anything to displease

557
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:54,703
or to trouble that person, or in any way hurt.

558
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:57,555
Without that development within you,

559
00:42:57,756 --> 00:43:01,078
you cannot become collective.

560
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:06,484
In collectivity what happens that you feel for others,

561
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,547
you understand others. You may not show off,

562
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:12,399
but you do, inside yourself you know.

563
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,688
Supposing somebody has done lots of funny things with you,

564
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:20,735
doesn't matter. But gradually you will see he will change,

565
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:25,251
gradually he will become better, because he'll realize that

566
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:30,212
whatever he has been doing has not been a correct thing to do.

567
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:34,228
He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way, but he will say,

568
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:38,478
"I should correct. Why did I do like this? I should not have done."

569
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:42,314
Gradually he will improve, but for that you should have

570
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:45,923
a great sense of forgiveness,

571
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,775
great sense of understanding.

572
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:52,283
Under circumstances, people also misbehave.

573
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:56,260
Because they've had no training how to be all right,

574
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,908
how to be humble, they misbehave.

575
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:03,791
Because in their culture perhaps, there is nothing but just anger,

576
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:06,471
and arrogance is regarded as something great,

577
00:44:06,672 --> 00:44:10,401
also they misbehave. Sometimes they come from such families

578
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:14,948
where only arrogance is taught, so you can't help it.

579
00:44:15,149 --> 00:44:19,167
Such people are to be forgiven again and again,

580
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,339
and see that they change.

581
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:26,487
Because I have a faith that all human beings

582
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:30,690
can be made into beautiful flowers of fragrance -

583
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:36,198
all the human beings. But I know there are some difficult ones.

584
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:39,919
Why? Because they don't want. If they don't want,

585
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,708
if they don't have the pure desire, you cannot force it on them.

586
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:48,396
So forget it, they are difficult people, forget about them.

587
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:55,763
But those who want, those who have a great desire

588
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:58,896
which is absolutely pure desire -

589
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:03,880
not for money, not for position, not for anything else,

590
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:10,177
but for achieving a great state of spirituality -

591
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:13,974
such people are to be helped at any cost.

592
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:18,326
I know some of them have gone to very wrong gurus and they have suffered;

593
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:21,646
they have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things.

594
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,755
Doesn't matter, you should try to help them.

595
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,424
If they can listen to you, if they can understand

596
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:31,018
what you are telling them, I'm sure it will work out.

597
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:34,237
It is worked out so much, as you can see now

598
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:38,964
that in the foreign countries where I was just an Indian,

599
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:43,300
how people have taken to it; how they have understood Me,

600
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,191
and how they have become Sahaja Yogis

601
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:48,925
of such a great value and level.

602
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:53,245
We never had so many saints in the olden days, never.

603
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:58,073
Only one saint would be born and he would be tortured.

604
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:00,675
There were not so many to help each other

605
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,933
and to protect each other.

606
00:46:03,134 --> 00:46:06,933
So collectivity is to be learned very well:

607
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:11,191
how to be collective, how to be nice to each other;

608
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:14,355
because later on when you become the guru,

609
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:18,894
when you have to guide the people,

610
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:22,269
you will know what are the problems of the collectivity are.

611
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:26,816
Also you will know how to overcome that,

612
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,285
how to make collectivity perfect.

613
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:34,269
And once you learn that thing, you'll be amazed

614
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:40,011
that you have mastered the art of being a guru.

615
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:45,308
I would like to see so many of you becoming a real guru,

616
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:50,808
real masters; not only in your jobs, in your talents,

617
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,347
but in your own life.

618
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:59,972
People should say that such and such person is a real guru.

619
00:47:00,173 --> 00:47:04,222
For that, as I said, you must learn obedience,

620
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:08,855
complete obedience. You should not question the guru.

621
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:10,621
Whatever is told to you, you must do;

622
00:47:10,822 --> 00:47:13,004
though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that.

623
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,254
Today is the first time I am saying it,

624
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,457
because I find so many of you

625
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:22,027
fall a little short of becoming perfect.

626
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:25,066
You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you,

627
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,550
you don't have to give up anything.

628
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:31,238
You don't have to give up your families or anything,

629
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:35,332
and do odd things just to show that you are perfect.

630
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,746
But it's something, a state within yourself

631
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:41,949
which you have to establish, where you become extremely humble,

632
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,691
obedient, and you'll be glowing with this light, I am sure.

633
00:47:46,892 --> 00:47:51,730
Once you understand the importance, then

634
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:55,243
you will dedicate yourself to become

635
00:47:55,444 --> 00:47:59,056
a personality of a real quality.

636
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:01,884
It's very difficult, as people something say,

637
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:04,251
but I think the easiest thing to be,

638
00:48:04,452 --> 00:48:09,329
because that's the most comfortable way of living in life -

639
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,720
no use fighting, no use quarreling, nobody trying to show off,

640
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:18,611
and all that. The care of everyone,

641
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,361
the suggestion of care,

642
00:48:21,562 --> 00:48:26,509
is very much satisfying for others.

643
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,704
A little care here and there, people like it.

644
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:33,196
And that only comes from a very noble soul

645
00:48:33,397 --> 00:48:36,079
who bothers about small, small things,

646
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,821
about whatever others need. It's not for your own advancement,

647
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:45,876
it's not for your own sort of leadership, whatever you may call,

648
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:51,243
or for your own positions - then you are falling short -

649
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:54,501
but it's for your own ascent,

650
00:48:54,702 --> 00:49:01,181
for your higher life that you give up

651
00:49:01,382 --> 00:49:06,931
all these ideas of leadership and this and that.

652
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:13,040
Is absurd the way sometimes I find some Sahaja Yogis

653
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:21,283
are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders; it's not correct.

654
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:24,691
So many times I have explained to you

655
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:29,537
that your own development, your own correction,

656
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:36,873
your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are.

657
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,045
Whatever others may say doesn't matter.

658
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:44,256
What you say about yourself truly, truthfully, is the reality,

659
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:46,904
and you must face yourself all the time.

660
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:49,256
I would say, specially for the ladies,

661
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:55,084
that I'm a woman and I have worked very hard all these years,

662
00:49:55,285 --> 00:50:02,279
and as a woman I must tell you that all the ladies should try;

663
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,115
because they always say "We are shaktis,"

664
00:50:06,316 --> 00:50:10,076
but in their life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis,

665
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:14,670
only their sort of dependence all the time on Sahaja Yoga.

666
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,928
They have to stand up in their own freedom,

667
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:19,576
they have to be independent,

668
00:50:19,777 --> 00:50:24,201
and they should have right ideas about everything.

669
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:27,506
I'm sure if the ladies come up that way,

670
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:30,733
Sahaja Yoga will spread very much.

671
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:34,577
Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are.

672
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:36,882
I can understand because they have families,

673
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,195
they have children, this thing.

674
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:41,359
But the most important thing is that

675
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,750
once you take to active Sahaja Yoga,

676
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:47,039
then your children also come up well,

677
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,180
the family is also looked after.

678
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:55,118
After all, there is this divine power which looks after all of you.

679
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,602
You must believe that this pure divine power thinks,

680
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:05,836
understands, it organizes; above all, it loves you.

681
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:09,992
This divine power has to be understood that

682
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:14,015
it is now your own

683
00:51:14,216 --> 00:51:17,335
and that you are in the realm of this divine power,

684
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:20,655
where you won't have any problems whatsoever.

685
00:51:20,856 --> 00:51:25,866
If you leave things to the divine power, it will all work out.

686
00:51:26,067 --> 00:51:29,616
As you know about this scientist who found out about Me.

687
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:34,366
I have to just say that he asked Me that

688
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:39,257
"How is it this so many hearts are made here?"

689
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:42,195
I said, "It's people who are singing the song,

690
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:44,586
'Sitting in the Heart of the Universe.'

691
00:51:44,787 --> 00:51:47,367
So this many hearts have come up."

692
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:51,594
But he said, "Still, does this power hear?"

693
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:56,469
I said, "No, it's Me only, I can hear.

694
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:02,852
I was hearing the song, and then the power organizes everything."

695
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,469
It's something to be understood very well

696
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:11,594
that the power within you, what you have, understands,

697
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,758
and understand you also.

698
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:20,227
It is a way of power which is your own power,

699
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,319
but you cannot control it.

700
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,203
It knows about you. Whenever you are falling,

701
00:52:28,404 --> 00:52:31,516
when you are doing wrong, the same power which protects you

702
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:33,657
and loves you like a mother,

703
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:38,133
will correct you and bring you to the right path.

704
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:42,094
I think now a new century is starting

705
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,352
and so many things have to happen,

706
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:48,961
and all of you must decide that you'll do this or that.

707
00:52:49,162 --> 00:52:55,180
Whatever is your understanding is about spreading Sahaja Yoga,

708
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:59,266
you should try to; all of you should put your mind to it.

709
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,352
If women can't go out they can write down something,

710
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:07,524
they can write about their spiritual ascent

711
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:12,540
or about whatever their experiences are.

712
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:15,633
So in any case all those who have got also

713
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:19,711
very miraculous photographs, they should send it over here.

714
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:23,633
Very important is, because this gentleman is coming here in September,

715
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,125
and he's going to analyze all of them.

716
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:28,914
So it would be very nice of you if you can send it.

717
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:34,881
Also you write down about your different experiences

718
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:38,654
you have had in Sahaja Yoga: that would be also a good idea.

719
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:42,482
He told Me that he would like to publish a book like that;

720
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:45,927
and now the time has come for us to publish

721
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:49,208
our miracles that have taken place.

722
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:52,364
All of you have had some experience of the miracle.

723
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:56,309
So I have to request you to send you, as soon as possible,

724
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:01,340
written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi,

725
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,121
because I don't understand other languages.

726
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:06,309
And please don't send Me in other languages,

727
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,957
we'll have to appoint somebody to translate them in fourteen languages,

728
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:14,520
it's a difficult thing. So I would request you to send that.

729
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:18,012
I am sure today's lecture, you will again go through it

730
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,996
and understand it, and work it out.

731
00:54:21,197 --> 00:54:25,900
May God bless you.
