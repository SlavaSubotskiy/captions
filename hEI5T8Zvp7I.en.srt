1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:26,910
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:37,820
It has to be understood that truth what we
know through our mental capacity is not the

3
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:48,580
truth, because mind itself is a myth.

4
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,790
We have created it.

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,690
As we have created computers.

6
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,660
we have created our myth also through our
conditioning and through our ego.

7
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,220
Beyond it is the reality.

8
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,320
So if you have to know the absolute truth
something has to happen.

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:23,810
We have to evolve into a higher realm of existence
of consciousness.

10
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,250
You have been already told about the subtle
system that you have.

11
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,460
You all have it.

12
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,250
You are the owner of it and you have every
right to achieve that state of consciousness

13
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,240
which in the Zen system call it “Satori”.

14
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,040
In every system they have something they call
it some name, like the Islam calls it “Wali”,

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,640
some called it “Sufi”.

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:06,830
In the realm of reality, when we are not,
we have problems, because we fight for unreal

17
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,810
things, you think of unreal thing as real
and accept.

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:22,500
For example, when they English lost the match.

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,609
I mean one party has to win, either this or
that.

20
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:33,079
But they were so much identified with it,
which was falsehood.

21
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:38,219
They were not playing, there were not players
that they were English, alright.

22
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,260
But there was no war going on.

23
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:49,159
See the myth about it is this, that we get
identified with things which are themselves

24
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,010
not real.

25
00:02:51,010 --> 00:03:05,099
And all these problems that we see of anger,
which is violence after all, or the attachments

26
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:14,579
we have, identifications we have, then the
lust and greed and all kinds of problems that

27
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:21,980
we see in every country is due to our imperfection.

28
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,489
It is due to our ignorance about reality while
reality is beautiful.

29
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:36,340
And we have to enter into that realm that
is what is seeking for.

30
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,999
The other day I was reading a book of a boy,
who was an athlete and who went through the

31
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:50,290
Zen system of training and it was so hard
and hazardous that I thought very few would

32
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,200
accept such a situation, very few.

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,950
Might have been in those days, there were
seekers of that quality that they worked it

34
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,950
out.

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,209
But now there is system available for you.

36
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,709
The knowledge that they gave you about the
subtle system we have is a fact, but if it

37
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:21,720
is a fact or not you should first verify don’t
just believe me or believe what he has said.

38
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,380
You should verify if it there within us this
subtle system of our ascent.

39
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,659
I knew about this since my childhood, but
I did not know how to explain to people because

40
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,440
I found people have no idea about it even
in India.

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,690
Traditionally, in India we had three types
of seekers.

42
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,440
One was through Vedas.

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:05:02,120
Even the first stanza of Veda says that, “If
you do not know yourself by reading or by

44
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,830
chanting these mantras it is useless”.

45
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:16,560
Then the second seeking, second style of seeking
was that of bhakti, is you to sing the name

46
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,520
of God, or you can pray to God.

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,030
Even great people like Gyanadeva did not know
want to do.

48
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:37,180
So they also said it is better to do bhakti,
bhakti of God because the time had not come

49
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,349
perhaps to give self-realization or may be
the people were not prepared to get it.

50
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:52,340
But in the center we had another great movement
which is called as Nath, Nathpanthis.

51
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,220
They say it came from Shiva, but whatever
it is; it came from Adinath and these people

52
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,639
and got diverted into many types.

53
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,990
But those who remained in the middle, one
of them was we should say was called Gahininath

54
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,479
and his disciple was Nivrutinath the elder
brother of Gyanadeva.

55
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,430
It is amazing if you read anything about them
they know all about chakras, they know all

56
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,680
about these all three channels.

57
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,070
Everything they new thousands of years back.

58
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,080
Then somehow or other they didn’t tell people.

59
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,460
They kept the knowledge to themselves.

60
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,129
I can’t say why they did it but they did.

61
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:48,860
Ultimately, Gyanadeva took permission of his
Guru Nivrutinath and said that let me tell

62
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:57,400
you, at least let me tell others, you allow
me because people should know what works it

63
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,449
out.

64
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,710
So he wrote about Kundalini.

65
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,090
But if you read these ancient books, you will
be amazed that the whole thing was described

66
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:13,879
in those books how you get your realization
and how then you have those centers which

67
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,669
are to be enlightened, what problems come
in.

68
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:24,229
But the method they employed for achieving
it was really hazardous.

69
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,129
I don’t know why they had to do it but they
did it.

70
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:38,889
They were all unmarried people and very strict
with themselves and they had to lead a life

71
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,002
very secluded from the society.

72
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:50,219
This was really a very difficult time of ascent
they had.

73
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:57,960
When I read about them I really feel very
extremely sad that all these great people

74
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:08,930
who were seeking had to go through such horrible
strenuous turmoil for days together and then

75
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,689
some of them got realisation.

76
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:19,360
But you are lucky people I should say to be
born at this time.

77
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:27,009
This is a special time, very special time,
which is described in all the books, all the

78
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:30,330
scriptures as the last judgment.

79
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:39,919
Now, if you start deciding about it through
your mental capacity you cannot achieve anything,

80
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:49,700
because you have only two agencies: one is
your conditioning, another is your ego.

81
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:58,460
So one has to rely on the natural gifts that
we have, is that of this Kundalini and she

82
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,810
is your individual mother; she does not want
to torture you, she does not want in any way

83
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,040
to give you any pains, whatsoever.

84
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:17,440
Also, there are some books written that Kundalini
means it is a something horrible and it can

85
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,470
kill you, it will do all these things.

86
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,370
All these years, now I have been working on
it, I have never seen anybody getting into

87
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,370
trouble.

88
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,900
But if you are in trouble you get out of it.

89
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,000
So, all these myths were created for Kundalini
also later on so that people should not take

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,100
to reality.

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:50,940
But all this knowledge was somehow lost, though
Gyanadeva had mentioned in his book that in

92
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:59,930
the sixth chapter he said that one should
seek through the awakening of Kundalini.

93
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,750
But people said no, this is no good, we are
not going to have it; because when those people

94
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:15,410
who organized the religion, become in charge
of the religion - actually you cannot organize,

95
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,950
you cannot organize religion - and once they
start organizing it you see they put there

96
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:29,150
own norms on people who are seeking.

97
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,030
So they said no this is something is not allowed
because they could not raise the Kundalini

98
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,840
may be.

99
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:45,870
But in the sixteenth century in India, suddenly
so many realized souls were born, saints were

100
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,870
born.

101
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,230
Perhaps they might have been Nathpanthis who
had died before may be, they have taken the

102
00:10:51,230 --> 00:11:00,180
birth, so many of them, and they started understanding
each other because they were one with reality.

103
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,060
Everybody was feeling the same thing about
each other.

104
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,780
There are many examples of that.

105
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,270
First of all I would say, Namadeva in Maharastra.

106
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:21,750
He was a tailor and he went to see one pitcher
- who make pitchers you see, potter you can

107
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:30,750
call it – and, when he went and saw this
fellow standing and trampling over the clay,

108
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,200
he just stood up and the sentence he said
is so remarkable.

109
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,140
He said,” I came here to see the formless
- that is the vibrations or Chaitnaya they

110
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,650
call it - but I see it in you in person.

111
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,810
It is in person I see it”.

112
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,950
This kind of appreciation is only possible
between people who are realised souls because

113
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,970
they understand each other.

114
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,650
Those who don’t understand you see have
different, different ideas, different, different

115
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,650
things.

116
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,490
Now they say that we must have peace.

117
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,050
How can you have peace?

118
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,330
One is going to the right direction, another
is going to the left direction, another is

119
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,130
going in middle some where hanging.

120
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,780
Everybody think they are right.

121
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,180
Whatever they are doing is right.

122
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,910
But what is the outcome of it.

123
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,970
Nobody is peaceful within.

124
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:42,260
They are fighting for things which has no
meaning at all in life.

125
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,890
They are many people who are fighting in the
name of God, I mean this is the worse someone

126
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,050
can do stupid thing.

127
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,860
How can you kill each other in the name of
God, how can you?

128
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:02,680
But this happening is accepted and not only
but it is regarded as religion.

129
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,830
Like this whole world is full of violent people.

130
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:18,640
You should say minimum disturbed people: families
are disturbed, children are disturbed, the

131
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,950
whole mother earth is shaking and everybody
is disturbed.

132
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,330
By saying that you should have peace you cannot
have.

133
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,770
By talking about you cannot have.

134
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:36,380
Because I have seen some people who got peace
awards, there is no peace within.

135
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:45,220
Only by transformation of human beings, by
evolving them, taking them into this realm

136
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:54,530
of peaceful existence of reality you can bring
peace.

137
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:02,110
Everybody wants peace but even if you want
you should genuinely ask for it.

138
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,640
If you are going to decide it mentally you
cannot.

139
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,350
Mentally everybody differs, everybody has
opinion for everything.

140
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,940
Like they will say, now they have come here.

141
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,730
I mean the modern mind is like this.

142
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,030
It always tries to runaway from the truth,
always.

143
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,570
If you, I will give simple example, if I tell
somebody to please telephone to such and such

144
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,440
gentlemen, immediately the other person will
say, “He may not be there.

145
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,940
He might have gone to his office.”

146
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,180
Today is Sunday how can he go to his office.

147
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,339
“Alright, then he might be...”

148
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,070
I said, “Why don’t you telephone first,
why do you react?

149
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,980
First telephone, finds if the person is there
or not.”

150
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,190
But that is not possible because the mind
is all the time wobbling, giving answers and

151
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,190
reacting.

152
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,030
Whatever you do, there is reaction.

153
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,110
It can also say now why so many flowers, I
never asked them but they did put it also.

154
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,220
I don’t know whom to be blamed, who is the
victim.

155
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,100
But they might say so.

156
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,810
They can have objection to everything.

157
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,960
But one thing is that why don’t you understand
that you are not at peace, at peace with your

158
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
self.

159
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:28,610
Unless and until you yourself at piece, you
cannot find faults with others.

160
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,860
You cannot judge others.

161
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,420
Why are you not at peace with your self?

162
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,550
(This is the thing one should understand)
Because you are not integrated.

163
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:50,600
Your mind, which is I have told you what it
is, says something then your heart says something

164
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,880
and then your liver says something.

165
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,080
There is no integration in your understanding
of any problem.

166
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,470
Once you are completely integrated then you
feel the peace.

167
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,870
But the best thing that happens I have seen
with Kundalini awakening is this.

168
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,450
We are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
and thinking so much.

169
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,830
Some people really have told me that to cut
our throat but stop this thinking.

170
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,030
Specially in modem time we think so much more
for everything.

171
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:37,560
I think without thinking we will be lost and
in this ocean of thinking, we are so frightened

172
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,900
with the waves, as if you are in the ocean
and there are waves around you and you are

173
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,560
very much frightened of them.

174
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,970
But supposing by any chance you get in to
a boat then you can watch these waves which

175
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:01,901
were frightening you and enjoy them; but supposing
you become an expert swimmer you can jump

176
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:03,770
down and save many.

177
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,679
In the same way it happens.

178
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,950
When Kundalini rises these waves that we have
of our thoughts which rises and falls, rises

179
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:22,030
and falls, and we are all the time jumping
on the cusp of the thoughts, either in the

180
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,030
past or in the future.

181
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,680
We cannot be in the present.

182
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,460
So when she rises, she elongates those thoughts.

183
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:36,140
There is a space in between that in the present
and in the present we don’t think but we

184
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,450
are aware, much more aware then we were ever.

185
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:50,660
We are in the center, we are in the center
and there it is our peace.

186
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,310
So we have to rise up to that point.

187
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,420
Now - as he has told you about all these centers
- when the Kundalini passes through them she

188
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,790
nourishes all of them.

189
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,690
These centers are responsible for our physical
mental, emotional, also our spiritual being.

190
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:15,400
So she nourishes them, integrates them and
ultimately pierces through our fontanel bone

191
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,920
area and connects us to this all pervading
power of divine love.

192
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,060
All the scriptures have described about this
thing.

193
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,760
they call it by different names, as I have
told you that they call it “Ruh”, they

194
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,020
call it “cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”,
they call it as the “all pervading power

195
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:45,630
of divine love”, all kinds of names like
“Param Chaitnya” as “Nirakar” they

196
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,240
call it “Alakh niranjan”.

197
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,480
All kinds of names they have given to this
all pervading power because you can see it,

198
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,920
you can see it and you can feel it after realisation.

199
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,110
You can feel it, it exist.

200
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,320
For the first time you feel it.

201
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,560
You see these flowers you take them for granted
how beautiful they are.

202
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:19,440
But it is a miracle, just think it, how beautifully
this mother earth has created for you all

203
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,820
these.

204
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,900
That means she is living organism.

205
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,840
She understands what to produce out of what
to do.?

206
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,710
Who does all this?

207
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,040
What is this energy?

208
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,850
This is the energy of divine Love.

209
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,300
When I say “Love”, I mean compassion,
it is the compassion.

210
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:51,190
It is a thing we don’t understand that how
can compassion be the truth.

211
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,551
But on a little lower level we can understand
it.

212
00:19:55,551 --> 00:20:00,160
If you love somebody then you know everything
about that person.

213
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,360
Take it that way.

214
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,710
Compassion is real intelligence.

215
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:24,090
Which gives you the, I mean, enlightened compassion,
the complete idea of the totality, it does

216
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,490
not talk of one here and one there but of
the totality it has.

217
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:38,440
Through its intelligence it understands what
is benevolent for the global peace, what is

218
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,580
benevolent for an individual problem.

219
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:50,860
It understands everything, because it hasn’t
got any angularities.

220
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,840
It is so pure.

221
00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:02,630
And this purity, which is compassion, which
is pure intelligence.

222
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:10,640
And once you enter into that realm you don’t
have to read anything.

223
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,680
You become just very knowledgeable, yourself
very knowledgeable.

224
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:28,010
So many powers you have within yourself, of
which you are not at all aware they all start

225
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,010
manifesting.

226
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:37,560
I have known people, ordinary artist coming
to Sahajayoga become now world famous artist.

227
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,230
Ordinary people who could not even come up
on the stage have become great orators.

228
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:55,000
All these qualities which make you so special
just start prospering and also manifesting

229
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,530
itself.

230
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:04,020
But that’s not, that’s like you see mother
giving chocolate for children, that is not

231
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,750
the main thing.

232
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:12,400
The main thing is that you reach a point that
you feel you don’t have to achieve any thing.

233
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
You have achieved everything.

234
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,250
All that hankering after achievement and all
that is finished.

235
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,750
Then you enjoy everything.

236
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,990
Your existence you enjoy.

237
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,550
You enjoy each and everything that you see.

238
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,660
This enjoyment cannot be described.

239
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,230
But it is to be experienced and to be felt.

240
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,750
I must say In England I worked the most because
somehow my husband is posted here and lot

241
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,650
of time and the country which I had worked
very hard is England, no doubt.

242
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:54,120
And I had an advantage of this English language
which I could speak also.

243
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,520
But I have seen that, once English take to
something, they will take it seriously.

244
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:08,240
But to take them to something is difficult,
because too much of mental activity.

245
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,530
We have to go humbly beyond this.

246
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,691
Because they will say, I don’t like this,
I did not like this I don’t want this.

247
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,990
That is not the thing.

248
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,100
Who are you?

249
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,320
Do you know who you are?

250
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,130
I want this, I believe, our politicians will
always say I believe, now who are you?

251
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,670
Do you know who you are? Mohammad Sahib has
said, “Unless and until you know yourself

252
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,150
you can not know God Almighty.

253
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,220
So why talk of God?

254
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
First know yourself.

255
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,960
That’s why Buddha never talked of God.

256
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:56,360
He said better not talk of God First know
yourself, because, you haven’t got yet,

257
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,440
the capacity to understand God.

258
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,510
First of all you must know yourself.

259
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,090
And to know yourself is quite easy now days.

260
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:14,040
I am amazed the way it worked in so many nations,
the way people have taken to Sahajayoga and

261
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:20,390
the way it is spreading, I am amazed; this
is the special time and a special blessing

262
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,580
where you are born when it was to happen.

263
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,390
But, still it’s a judgment; again I will
say it’s a judgment.

264
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,340
Nobody can force you.

265
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,620
You have to judge yourself whether you want
it or not.

266
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,630
There cannot be any forcing.

267
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,360
But you see, this countries also, European
countries I have some ideas, they think it

268
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
is a cult.

269
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,140
I mean I can not understand how can there
be a cult when where there are no weapons

270
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,440
used, there is no money taken, there is nothing
as such peace such joy, such friendship among

271
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,160
so many nations its established.

272
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,410
If it is cult alright, does not matter.

273
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,059
I wish there were some more like that!

274
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:16,780
This mind all the time criticizing, finding
fault, this and that.

275
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,390
But what have you got so far.

276
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,520
As a Mother, I will say you have to be selfish.

277
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,040
Just know that you have to know yourself and
that is what will give you everything that

278
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,690
you want.

279
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,460
Actually the wants also change.

280
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,690
It is very surprising how after Sahaja yoga
people change.

281
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:49,230
Of course there are one or two here and there
who are not so good.

282
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:57,140
But they will be, they will be, they have
certain hankering, something hanging in there

283
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,280
minds I think.

284
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,410
But most of them come up so fast.

285
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,190
I am really amazed, how these things are happening
in the western countries.

286
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,750
India, of course, no problem, because they
have the heritage, they have the knowledge

287
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,360
they know everything, they know what they
have to get.

288
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,950
But here in England, I was really amazed,
how it has worked out.

289
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:30,520
So seekers are born every where, I see now
this seeking is so deep and so much maddening

290
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,910
for people.

291
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,790
Of course many people have made money out
of it.

292
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,740
That’s where I can’t understand.

293
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,960
They have made marketing thing, you cannot
market, you see, this is your evolutionary

294
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
process.

295
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,010
How much money do we go give to mother earth
for giving us these flowers?

296
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,720
It is natural process of evolution, which
has to take place in simple words it is “Sahaja”.

297
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,280
Sahaja means spontaneous.

298
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,380
It’s born with you.

299
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,280
It is a great chance of becoming sahaja yogis.

300
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,070
“Yoga” means the union with the Divine.

301
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:18,130
You get powers, it is not just to say I am
twice born have some sort of sign board; but

302
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,170
you become.

303
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,980
Is the becoming is the point.

304
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,250
You really become and in that becoming you
get powers, you can raise the Kundalini of

305
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,290
others you can cure people.

306
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,870
I mean so many things happen.

307
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:44,640
The greatest thing happens is that such a
person become extremely peaceful, wise and

308
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,670
enjoyable.

309
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:52,930
As Namadeva enjoyed, Gora Kumbhar they enjoyed
each other.

310
00:27:52,930 --> 00:28:02,750
Then Namdeva went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka:
he saw another realized soul, immediately

311
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:10,270
he recognized, and he said “It is so nice
you come to Punjab, now you better learn Punjabi

312
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,690
language and write beautiful poetry as you
done it in Marathi language.”

313
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,330
So there is such a big book written in Punjabi
language by this great poet.

314
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:26,181
You too had great poets here, there is Lewis,
then we have William Blake.

315
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:29,350
William Blake was unknown to us in India.

316
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,960
They never, they thought he’d be a mad man
or what I don’t know.

317
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,950
After coming to London only I could discuss
something about him such a great man, such

318
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,320
a great poet.

319
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,120
But they had to write it in this poetry, because
if they were saying something, they would

320
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,679
have been murdered or killed, I don’t know
what would have happened.

321
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:59,640
So they wrote it in poetry when people couldn’t
understand much.

322
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,440
They have [not clear] way for us.

323
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,800
They have created this path.

324
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:15,210
For them the greatest thing is that it is
working out because they are all together.

325
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,440
First so many came, trying this, and else
you see build the path.

326
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:30,570
Now, it iss complete, not only that, but also
the temple is ready for you to enter in.

327
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,670
The whole work of this great people has helped
us.

328
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,520
They were never against each other, Never.

329
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:51,510
When they talk different religions I can’t
understand specially, when Moses, Abraham,

330
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,230
were described by Christ.

331
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,610
How come the Jews fighting Christians, I can’t
understand?

332
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:05,429
Not only but also Mohammed sahib described
about Christ, his mother, much more with greater

333
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:10,049
respect than in the Bible.

334
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:14,560
So how can this people fight among themselves?

335
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:21,040
It is to be seen clearly in their books only,
they find the books so authentic it is in

336
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,450
the book written down that they followed all
these great people.

337
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,610
So there cannot be any devising thing that
is a religion.

338
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,420
Religion cannot divide.

339
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,170
Actually religion is within ourselves.

340
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:43,559
And when you get your realization you suddenly
become very righteous, suddenly.

341
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:51,540
I have see in this England only, people taking
drugs and all that overnight gave up, overnight.

342
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:58,679
It is remarkable how in the light of the spirit
they saw what is wrong with them, what is

343
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,190
destructive and they just gave it up.

344
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,390
Such beautiful people have come up.

345
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:12,679
You won’t believe that these were the people
who lost all hopes about themselves and how

346
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:21,330
now they have become such beautiful beings,
I am very proud of them.

347
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,110
This lecture of mine should not upset you
in any way.

348
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:32,080
If I have said something that makes you feel
little nervous or any thing, you should not

349
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,630
worry.

350
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,820
Because your Kundalini is all the time there
and innocence cannot be destroyed.

351
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,700
Of course some clouds come over it but there
is the deity of innocence sitting within you

352
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,990
and it holds everything works out without
any problem.

353
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,820
Only thing you have to desire for it and asked
for it.

354
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,669
As I said it can not be forced.

355
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:01,340
I respect your freedom, and in your freedom
you need to receive your self realisation.

356
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,710
It cannot be forced, it cannot be argued,
nothing of the kind; because it is natural

357
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:15,690
process as I said, is a natural process, and
for the natural process how can you argue

358
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,160
it.

359
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:26,430
So, I would request you, first of all, that
those who do not want to have Self Realization

360
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,100
should leave the hall.

361
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,480
Because it will take hardly 10 minutes, hardly
10 minutes.

362
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:45,030
But those who don’t want should leave the
hall, would be nice, very amicably, I will

363
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:55,290
be thankful.

364
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:15,809
[Pause for some minute]

365
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:23,900
One thing I have to tell you that there are
mainly two problems with human beings where

366
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:33,490
Kundalini stops: one of them when you feel
guilty.

367
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:39,710
When somebody tells you, you are sinner or
something like that, such an idea crops into

368
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,820
your head, and you think you are sinner and
they are afraid.

369
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,490
Many people have told me, “We are afraid
of you.”

370
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,100
I said “Why?”Because you have sinned…
that’s why I am here, why you should be

371
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,490
afraid.

372
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:01,370
So first thing is that I love you all and
you all should love yourself.

373
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:07,480
Because you all are human beings and at the
epitome of the evolution.

374
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,570
So please give up the idea of feeling guilty.

375
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,020
Alright, you have done something wrong, accept
it.

376
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,010
That is finished now that is past and I am
talking about present.

377
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,299
That is finished.

378
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:28,389
As far as this moment is concerned, it is
doesn’t exist.

379
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:39,729
So, don’t think of what you have done wrong
or what you have been worried about and all

380
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,749
the time thinking.

381
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:52,339
Also our modern life is so much, full of norms
that even a little thing you do like, even

382
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,173
if you put the spoon on this side to that
side, you feel guilty.

383
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:59,849
Oh I did like that.

384
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,569
If you were really guilty, you would have
been in jail not here.

385
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:08,720
You should have very pleasant attitude towards
yourself and not to feel guilty.

386
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:17,119
That is what I am requesting you again and
again don’t feel guilty.

387
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,279
Then the second thing is why I say so.

388
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:25,130
Because this center [left Vishuddhi] here
left side catches.

389
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:33,630
It goes into very big jeopardy, into very
big problem and this center can give you spondylitis

390
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:41,989
to minimum, or angina or all your organs become
very lethargic.

391
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:45,309
So why carry this guilt with you?

392
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:54,839
So give up the guilt.

393
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,549
The second simple thing is that please forgive
everyone, in general.

394
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,830
Don’t think about them.

395
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,890
If you don’t forgive then you go on thinking,
“Oh my goodness he troubled me” like this

396
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,979
and the person who has troubled you is quite
happy while you are just troubling yourself.

397
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:19,829
By that you catch on the Agyna which is in
the center of this optic chiasm like this.

398
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:26,411
And it is so close and so constricted, that
if you want forgive it want open and how will

399
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:28,400
the Kundalini pass through?

400
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,079
So just forgive all of them and don’t think
about to whom you have to forgive.

401
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,970
Just say in general, I forgive everyone.

402
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:45,829
Many people say it is difficult, it’s a
myth.

403
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,509
You forgive or you don’t forgive what do
you do, do nothing.

404
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:53,010
But when you don’t forgive then the all
problems start.

405
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,559
So better forgive everyone.

406
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:02,229
Without even thinking that you have to forgive
this person or that person.

407
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:07,180
It is headache even to think about them so
better not.

408
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:14,710
This center is very important, specially for
Christians.

409
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:25,640
You know that how forgiveness was [not clear]
that Christ has manifested and requested all

410
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,979
of you to forgive.

411
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:39,190
The third thing I have to request is that
have full faith in yourself that you are all

412
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,349
going to get your self realisation.

413
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:45,700
Please have this faith in yourself.

414
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,059
If you have that faith it will workout.

415
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:55,289
In no way condemn yourself or say that how
could I get it.

416
00:37:55,289 --> 00:38:06,130
In Genoa it happened, it was not such a big
hall but quite a big hall and everybody got

417
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,130
realisation.

418
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,940
And for at least half of they were stunt they
couldn’t believe that they were feeling

419
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:20,740
the cool breeze of Holy Ghost, they just could
not believe it, for a half a minute.

420
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,769
Then they looked very happy and joyous and
started smiling and clapping.

421
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:30,509
So it is going to happen to you all.

422
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:34,960
I promise, but have just faith in yourself.

423
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,950
You all can get it.

424
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,759
Another thing I have to request is if you
can take out your shoes, this mother earth

425
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:43,489
helps us a lot.
