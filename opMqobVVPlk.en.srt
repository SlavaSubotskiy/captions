00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:06,435
Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 27 July 1992.

2
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:06,042
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:18,167
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

4
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:27,125
We cannot imagine about it,

5
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:30,834
think about it or conceptualize it.

6
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:46,542
Also unfortunately, at this human level we cannot feel it.

7
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:56,501
We have to become a subtler being

8
01:07:56,709 --> 01:08:00,709
to feel our subtle being.

9
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,918
We have to be the Spirit.

10
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:18,542
Otherwise whatever we think about it

11
01:08:18,751 --> 01:08:20,834
is not reality.

12
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:39,751
Reality has to be known by ascending

13
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,083
to another state of Spirit.

14
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:54,876
Now, let us know what is the truth.

15
01:08:57,999 --> 01:09:03,792
The truth is we are not this body, this mind

16
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:08,375
Is... Sorry, go ahead.

17
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:17,751
This is not your conditionings,

18
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,834
nor your ego, emotions,

19
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,959
but it is pure Spirit.

20
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:37,501
The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power

21
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:39,876
of Divine Love,

22
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,542
which does all the living work.

23
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:59,584
We see these beautiful flowers –  it’s a miracle,

24
01:10:03,125 --> 01:10:05,292
but we take it for granted.

25
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,459
Look at our eyes,

26
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:14,626
which is a miracle itself – it’s a camera.

27
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:24,542
Look at our brain, which is such a computer.

28
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:31,459
But we take it for granted

29
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:36,125
and do not think about it.

30
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:40,417
Who does this work?

31
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:45,792
Who runs our heart?

32
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:59,584
What's the matter? Please take the child out.

33
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:11,250
We call it in medical terminology

34
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:14,834
that autonomous nervous system runs the heart.

35
01:11:20,417 --> 01:11:22,876
But who is this auto?

36
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:30,792
All this living work is done by

37
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:34,626
this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

38
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:47,501
Whatever I’m telling you, you need not take it blindfolded.

39
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:56,999
But you have to keep your mind open

40
01:11:57,626 --> 01:12:00,042
like a scientist

41
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:06,125
and treat it as a hypothesis.

42
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:13,083
And if you find that it is true

43
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:17,584
then you have to accept it as honest people.

44
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:26,250
Because it is for your benevolence

45
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:30,501
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

46
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:45,042
So now, within us is based this mechanism,

47
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:49,209
which has been shown to you and about which they have told you.

48
01:12:56,999 --> 01:13:00,125
And there is this power

49
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,042
which is going to connect you

50
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,626
to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

51
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,209
We are all born

52
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:22,834
with that Divinity within us in a potential state.

53
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:32,542
And it is quite intact.

54
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:36,417
Whatever you might have done,

55
01:13:36,626 --> 01:13:39,792
whatever so called mistakes you might have committed,

56
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:44,501
this faith of Divinity is also within us.

57
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:55,584
We had this faith from our childhood,

58
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:58,459
but gradually we lost it.

59
01:14:03,959 --> 01:14:07,292
We had faith that there is something beyond

60
01:14:07,584 --> 01:14:10,459
and that’s what we have lost it.

61
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:17,626
Or we are misled.

62
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,459
We have to understand that

63
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:31,584
this Divinity is absolutely there,

64
01:14:31,876 --> 01:14:36,250
untarnished, without any problem,

65
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:47,834
because it is of eternal nature.

66
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:56,626
Like clouds, maybe some of the actions

67
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:00,250
in our life might have covered it.

68
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:14,083
But you’ll be amazed to see that it is there, alive.

69
01:15:19,584 --> 01:15:23,792
Now, the second problem we have to understand

70
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:28,751
that all world problems come from human beings.

71
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:36,959
And all human problems come from

72
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,918
these fundamental centers within us.

73
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:50,000
When these fundamental centers go into problems

74
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,250
we get all kinds of physical, mental,

75
01:15:54,459 --> 01:15:57,292
emotional, social, political

76
01:15:57,584 --> 01:16:00,501
and also spiritual problems.

77
01:16:06,918 --> 01:16:10,999
Physical, mental, emotional,

78
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:15,999
political, economical and social.

79
01:16:17,167 --> 01:16:23,083
So, if these centers could be corrected, nourished,

80
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:27,083
made healthy all the problems will be solved.

81
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:42,375
The time has come for us to achieve that state of Spirit.

82
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:53,375
Is a special time. I call it the blossom time.

83
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:59,667
In the Bible they called it the Last Judgment.

84
01:17:04,459 --> 01:17:07,292
In the Koran, Puranas,

85
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:11,959
also it is described as ”Satya Yuga”.

86
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:21,125
And in the Koran it is described as

87
01:17:21,334 --> 01:17:23,834
”Kiyama”, meaning Resurrection time.

88
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,542
It is fortunate that at this time you are all born

89
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,751
and that you are seekers of truth.

90
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:46,751
Sahaja Yoga – ”Saha” means ‘with you’, is born the right

91
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,626
to achieve the state of Spirit.

92
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:57,334
”’Ja”’ is born.

93
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:15,209
So, this right you have. All of you have got that right.

94
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:18,834
And you have to achieve that state of Spirit.

95
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:30,292
In short I’ll tell you what is this nature of the Spirit.

96
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:38,501
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty.

97
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:44,999
So, it is a universal being.

98
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:55,417
It exists as a witness in our heart.

99
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,667
It watches whatever we are doing.

100
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:08,751
But when it manifests in our attention

101
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:15,334
then we can feel

102
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:20,125
the our centers and the centers of others.

103
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:33,501
Thus we get self knowledge – selfhood.

104
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:40,542
And also we develop a new dimension in our awareness

105
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:44,167
called as collective consciousness,

106
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:54,751
when you can feel the centers of others.

107
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:01,501
If you can understand

108
01:20:01,918 --> 01:20:07,626
and master the art of Divine working

109
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:10,626
you can cure your centers

110
01:20:10,834 --> 01:20:14,250
and you can cure the centers of others.

111
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:29,417
When this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area

112
01:20:29,626 --> 01:20:34,125
it connects you to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

113
01:20:41,876 --> 01:20:45,542
Just like this instrument has got this

114
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:49,375
connection with the mains, in the same way

115
01:20:49,584 --> 01:20:52,876
you get connected with that power.

116
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:03,375
Once this connection is fully established

117
01:21:03,584 --> 01:21:07,626
all the time this dynamic energy starts flowing through you.

118
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:20,709
You become dynamic – at the same time extremely compassionate.

119
01:21:26,542 --> 01:21:31,626
You become very wise, with divine discretion.

120
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:37,709
On your fingertips you can feel

121
01:21:37,918 --> 01:21:40,918
your centers and the centers of others.

122
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:48,834
Everybody feels the same.

123
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:53,042
If you want to know this is wrong or right

124
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,209
you can feel it on your fingertips.

125
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:04,042
Thus you know the absolute truth.

126
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:10,626
If everyone feels the same way,

127
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:15,417
then how can there be quarrels? How can there be wars also?

128
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:29,709
So, this is a new awareness,

129
01:22:29,959 --> 01:22:34,042
a new dimension, which manifests within us.

130
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:43,959
And it takes us much beyond mental activity,

131
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:48,125
where your thoughts cannot overpower you.

132
01:22:56,209 --> 01:23:00,042
Thoughts come from the future or from the past

133
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,334
and we are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.

134
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:16,542
But with this happening we enter into our present.

135
01:23:21,542 --> 01:23:24,999
In between these thoughts there is a space

136
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,667
where there is peace

137
01:23:27,918 --> 01:23:30,834
and we enter into our peace.

138
01:23:39,584 --> 01:23:44,000
This state, in this state you become

139
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:47,292
thoughtlessly aware.

140
01:23:56,042 --> 01:24:02,542
When you start growing in your spiritual being

141
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:07,918
then the second thing that happens to you

142
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:12,334
is that you become

143
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:19,167
one with reality.

144
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:30,626
All kinds of falsehood start dropping out.

145
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,250
And you know that you have become a saint.

146
01:24:39,584 --> 01:24:43,876
And you become extremely confident with your knowledge.

147
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:54,834
The Spirit is the source of joy.

148
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:02,501
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

149
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:10,167
Joy has no duality.

150
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:16,834
It does not have happiness and unhappiness.

151
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,167
It is absolute.

152
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,000
All this is your own.

153
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,125
You have to just get it.

154
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:38,125
It’s a very easy thing,

155
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:42,042
it’s very spontaneous, it’s a living process.

156
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:51,167
For this process you don’t have to pay.

157
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:57,834
You don’t have to put in any efforts.

158
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,375
It’s spontaneous.

159
01:26:04,584 --> 01:26:07,584
It spontaneously sprouts.

160
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:14,959
You have to only look after it like a gardener.

161
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:26,834
Whatever I am telling you is not a sermon or a lecture,

162
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:35,792
it’s the actualization of the experience.

163
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:45,375
And actualization of your baptism.

164
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:52,042
Because you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost

165
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,501
coming out of your head.

166
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:04,334
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

167
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:12,501
And Kundalini is the Primordial Mother.

168
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:21,209
This is what is reflected in you

169
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:24,459
as your own individual mother.

170
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:32,209
And she gives you your second birth.

171
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,709
Christ has said,

172
01:27:38,918 --> 01:27:42,959
“The humble in heart will inherit the Earth.”

173
01:27:51,626 --> 01:27:54,959
So one has to be humble.

174
01:27:58,417 --> 01:28:02,999
If you are arrogant about it, your own Kundalini won’t rise.

175
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:14,209
Moreover

176
01:28:15,459 --> 01:28:19,667
this Kundalini knows all about you.

177
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:26,876
She does not give you any trouble.

178
01:28:29,459 --> 01:28:34,667
And just spontaneously She manages to connect you

179
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:37,999
to that All-pervading Divine Power.

180
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:49,292
And for the first time you start feeling on your fingertips

181
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:54,375
this All-pervading Power as cool breeze.

182
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,709
I respect your freedom,

183
01:29:06,918 --> 01:29:12,292
and your Self Realization cannot be forced on you.

184
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:24,792
Those who really want it, in a humble way, can have it.

185
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:34,125
Those who do not want

186
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:38,125
are not forced – cannot be forced.

187
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:45,459
All such people should please leave the hall.

188
01:29:50,751 --> 01:29:55,792
It will take about 10 or 15 minutes to get your Realization.

189
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:04,626
In this short time you should appreciate I cannot tell you

190
01:30:04,834 --> 01:30:07,959
everything about this vast knowledge,

191
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,417
but if you get your enlightenment

192
01:30:16,626 --> 01:30:19,792
you’ll understand this subtle knowledge very easily.

193
01:30:30,876 --> 01:30:34,834
So, those who do not want can leave the hall.

194
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:42,250
It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes.

195
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:49,167
The lights are very dim, I can’t see the people.

196
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:06,250
I know, some of you have questions –

197
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:11,042
but just now keep them away from yourself.

198
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:19,918
And you can write them down

199
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:23,083
and we’ll try to answer them later on.

200
01:31:32,542 --> 01:31:34,751
Can’t see them.

201
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,876
It's good.

202
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:04,751
There are three conditions which are very simple.

203
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:13,042
The first condition is that

204
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,375
you all have to have  full confidence

205
01:32:16,584 --> 01:32:21,000
that you will all get your Self Realization tonight.

206
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:37,959
Second is you are not to feel guilty

207
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:41,292
about anything whatsoever.

208
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:53,250
This idea of sin – please take it out of your mind.

209
01:32:58,209 --> 01:33:00,209
This gives you a guilt,

210
01:33:00,417 --> 01:33:03,584
which makes your left Vishuddhi here – this chakra –

211
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:06,375
very weak.

212
01:33:15,999 --> 01:33:20,918
And this causes a disease called angina,

213
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:25,999
spondylitis and the lethargy of the organs.

214
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:40,334
If you have done mistakes, it’s all right.

215
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:43,918
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

216
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,417
And if you have done mistakes you should face them,

217
01:33:54,626 --> 01:33:58,959
instead of putting them as guilt here and torture yourself.

218
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:07,751
In short, forgive yourself

219
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:12,250
and be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

220
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:23,334
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

221
01:34:29,918 --> 01:34:35,334
This Divine Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

222
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:44,959
And you cannot commit any mistake

223
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:50,250
that cannot be dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

224
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:04,292
The third condition is also very simple.

225
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,959
Third ccondition is that you have to forgive everyone.

226
01:35:19,918 --> 01:35:23,209
You have to forgive in general, you don’t have to think

227
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,999
about each one of them.

228
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:32,501
Logically,

229
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:36,751
whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

230
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:46,626
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

231
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:55,918
Those who have tortured you, or troubled you are happy

232
01:35:56,083 --> 01:36:00,584
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

233
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:15,501
So, what’s the use of not forgiving?

234
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:26,292
Moreover, the chakra which we call as the Agnya chakra,

235
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:30,042
in the optic chiasma,

236
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:33,834
it's closed like this, constricted like this.

237
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:44,375
It won’t open unless and until you forgive.

238
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But once you forgive it opens like this.

239
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:57,792
You have to just say, “I forgive everyone of them.”

240
01:36:57,999 --> 01:37:01,250
Don’t even think of them, because it’s a headache.

241
01:37:09,334 --> 01:37:11,918
These are the only three conditions.

242
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:18,542
If you really accept them, it will work out very fast.

243
01:37:21,959 --> 01:37:24,999
You have to cooperate with Me.

244
01:37:29,501 --> 01:37:31,876
Now

245
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:35,999
we have to take out our shoes. That will help us a lot,

246
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:41,083
because this Mother Earth sucks in our problems.

247
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,959
Now, they have already told you about the left and right side.

248
01:38:17,584 --> 01:38:19,417
And

249
01:38:19,626 --> 01:38:22,626
as they are two powers, we have to put both the feet

250
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:25,209
little away from each other.

251
01:38:33,999 --> 01:38:38,751
You don’t have to stay in yourself, you have to be comfortable

252
01:38:38,999 --> 01:38:41,667
only thing, don’t bend yourself too much

253
01:38:41,876 --> 01:38:44,792
or don’t stretch yourself too much till I tell you.

254
01:38:50,834 --> 01:38:52,999
You have to be very comfortable.

255
01:38:55,959 --> 01:38:58,584
You don’t have to go to Himalayas for that.

256
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,459
And you don’t have to suffer.

257
01:39:06,501 --> 01:39:08,709
Christ has suffered for us already.

258
01:39:14,834 --> 01:39:17,125
Just have faith in yourself.

259
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:23,751
Don’t be doubts about yourself.

260
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:33,250
I assure you, you all can get your Self Realization tonight.

261
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:45,876
So, now we’ll show you how we’ll nourish

262
01:39:46,042 --> 01:39:49,375
our own centers, you will nourish your own centers.

263
01:39:55,709 --> 01:39:59,209
Please put your left hand towards Me like this.

264
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:09,626
This is symbolic that you want your Self Realization,

265
01:40:09,959 --> 01:40:14,999
because left side is the power of ordinary desire.

266
01:40:24,792 --> 01:40:26,792
All of you have to do it.

267
01:40:26,999 --> 01:40:30,167
Those who don’t want to do should go away.

268
01:40:38,501 --> 01:40:42,792
Then we have the second power,

269
01:40:42,999 --> 01:40:45,626
the power of action on the right hand side,

270
01:40:45,834 --> 01:40:49,083
with which we’ll be nourishing our centers.

271
01:40:59,167 --> 01:41:02,751
Third is the power of Kundalini

272
01:41:02,959 --> 01:41:06,459
which is the power of pure desire.

273
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:17,375
So, all of you should have pure desire in your heart

274
01:41:17,584 --> 01:41:22,584
that you should all get your Self Realization.

275
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:32,751
So, just put your left hand towards Me like this,

276
01:41:32,959 --> 01:41:40,000
very comfortably on your lap or on your legs,

277
01:41:48,501 --> 01:41:51,375
resting like this.

278
01:41:52,959 --> 01:41:55,417
Now, with the right hand we’ll be nourishing

279
01:41:55,626 --> 01:41:58,375
our centers on the left hand side.

280
01:42:02,876 --> 01:42:07,959
First we do it, we’ll show you and then we'll close our eyes

281
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:10,375
and the process will start.

282
01:42:16,876 --> 01:42:19,999
Please put your right hand on your heart.

283
01:42:23,959 --> 01:42:29,792
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

284
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:40,083
If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit,

285
01:42:40,292 --> 01:42:43,375
you become your guide, your master.

286
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:54,667
Then you put your hand... Please come. put your hand

287
01:42:54,834 --> 01:42:59,751
on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

288
01:43:05,876 --> 01:43:09,667
This is the center of your mastery.

289
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:18,709
This is being created by great prophets.

290
01:43:22,999 --> 01:43:25,501
We have to just enlighten it.

291
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:30,876
Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion

292
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:34,125
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

293
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:39,375
Lower, lower, lower here.

294
01:43:43,501 --> 01:43:46,167
This is the center

295
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:51,125
for pure divine knowledge.

296
01:43:57,959 --> 01:44:02,083
Again we raise our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

297
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:12,125
Then we raise our right hand on our heart.

298
01:44:16,999 --> 01:44:19,209
Now we raise our right hand

299
01:44:19,417 --> 01:44:21,542
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

300
01:44:21,751 --> 01:44:23,792
and turn our head to our right.

301
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:31,999
This is the center as I told you –

302
01:44:34,999 --> 01:44:38,292
I told you this center

303
01:44:38,501 --> 01:44:41,751
gets in trouble when you feel guilty.

304
01:44:48,584 --> 01:44:52,375
Now, please take your right hand

305
01:44:52,584 --> 01:44:56,834
on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

306
01:45:03,709 --> 01:45:08,584
This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness

307
01:45:09,999 --> 01:45:13,000
no, no, you have to forgive others, I am sorry.

308
01:45:13,459 --> 01:45:16,792
This is the center where you have to forgive others.

309
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:23,334
Now please take your right hand back side of your head

310
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:25,709
and push back your head.

311
01:45:30,292 --> 01:45:36,125
Here. Here, without feeling guilty,

312
01:45:36,334 --> 01:45:40,626
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction

313
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:43,125
you have to ask forgiveness

314
01:45:43,334 --> 01:45:46,459
from the All-pervading Divine Power.

315
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:03,209
Now, the last center which is very important.

316
01:46:06,125 --> 01:46:09,667
Please stretch your palm

317
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:15,501
and put the center of your palm

318
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:19,626
on top of the fontanel bone area,

319
01:46:19,834 --> 01:46:22,292
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

320
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,584
Now, very important is to push back your fingers,

321
01:46:32,792 --> 01:46:34,042
there is a good pressure,

322
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,751
there should be a good pressure on your scalp.

323
01:46:43,292 --> 01:46:45,834
Now, please put down your head.

324
01:46:51,709 --> 01:46:57,709
Here now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

325
01:47:11,918 --> 01:47:13,999
That’s all we have to do.

326
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,209
Now you have to close your eyes.

327
01:47:39,042 --> 01:47:42,584
And till I tell you please don’t open your eyes.

328
01:47:47,459 --> 01:47:49,459
Just turn it towards Me.

329
01:47:50,459 --> 01:47:53,375
Both the feet away from each other.

330
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:06,125
Now please take out your spectacles.

331
01:48:11,626 --> 01:48:13,501
No, it doesn't work out here.

332
01:48:18,584 --> 01:48:21,334
Put your right hand on your heart.

333
01:48:25,918 --> 01:48:27,959
Now it's better.

334
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:33,000
Put it on here. Much better.

335
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:37,375
It’s terrible, such heat I’m absorbing from all of them.

336
01:48:37,918 --> 01:48:41,501
Terrible heat they have. All right, doesn’t matter.

337
01:48:41,709 --> 01:48:44,834
Please put your right hand on your heart.

338
01:48:51,876 --> 01:48:56,083
Here now you have to ask Me a very fundamental question

339
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:04,375
three times,

340
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:11,375
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

341
01:49:14,999 --> 01:49:20,999
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

342
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,626
It's better now. Little bit [strike] it more.

343
01:49:44,334 --> 01:49:47,083
I have already told you

344
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:51,459
that if you become the Spirit

345
01:49:52,209 --> 01:49:58,209
you become your own master.

346
01:50:06,209 --> 01:50:08,584
So, now please take your hand

347
01:50:08,792 --> 01:50:12,626
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

348
01:50:19,876 --> 01:50:26,209
Here, here you have to say again another question.

349
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:35,918
Three times please ask,

350
01:50:36,083 --> 01:50:40,083
“Mother am I my own master?”

351
01:51:09,959 --> 01:51:13,626
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom.

352
01:51:17,584 --> 01:51:22,250
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

353
01:51:26,334 --> 01:51:28,918
You have to ask for it.

354
01:51:30,999 --> 01:51:35,959
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

355
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:39,501
on the left hand side and press it hard.

356
01:51:45,876 --> 01:51:49,459
Here you have to ask six times,

357
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:53,292
because this center has got six petals.

358
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:04,876
Please say, “Mother,

359
01:52:05,209 --> 01:52:08,999
give me pure knowledge.

360
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:13,042
Please Mother, give me pure knowledge.” Six times.

361
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:33,918
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

362
01:52:34,083 --> 01:52:38,042
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

363
01:52:45,542 --> 01:52:51,542
So now, we have to nourish our higher centers

364
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:55,792
so that Kundalini can pass easily through them.

365
01:53:02,292 --> 01:53:06,167
It has to be nourished with our self confidence.

366
01:53:09,959 --> 01:53:12,334
So, now please take your right hand

367
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:15,334
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

368
01:53:20,584 --> 01:53:26,834
And here you have to say with full confidence

369
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:32,125
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

370
01:53:32,334 --> 01:53:34,334
Please say it ten times.

371
01:53:55,626 --> 01:53:58,709
I’ve already told you that you are not this body,

372
01:53:58,918 --> 01:54:02,626
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

373
01:54:02,876 --> 01:54:06,125
but you are pure Spirit.

374
01:54:16,209 --> 01:54:20,292
So, now please raise your right hand on your heart.

375
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:27,999
And here

376
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:32,417
with full confidence say twelve times,

377
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:38,042
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

378
01:54:57,751 --> 01:55:02,417
The All-pervading Divine Power is the Ocean

379
01:55:02,626 --> 01:55:06,209
of divine knowledge.

380
01:55:14,083 --> 01:55:18,042
It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss.

381
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:25,501
But above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

382
01:55:28,626 --> 01:55:31,292
So whatever mistake you have committed

383
01:55:31,501 --> 01:55:35,709
can be easily dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

384
01:55:44,584 --> 01:55:48,250
So, now please raise your hand

385
01:55:48,584 --> 01:55:56,334
on to the corner of, between your neck and your shoulder,

386
01:55:56,542 --> 01:55:59,417
and turn your head to your right.

387
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:12,918
Here now with full confidence, please say 16 times,

388
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:16,209
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all.”

389
01:56:23,918 --> 01:56:26,918
Please turn your head to your right.

390
01:56:38,209 --> 01:56:40,792
I have already told you whether you forgive

391
01:56:40,999 --> 01:56:43,999
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

392
01:56:49,876 --> 01:56:54,334
But you torture yourself and play into wrong hands.

393
01:56:58,999 --> 01:57:01,999
So,

394
01:57:07,876 --> 01:57:11,459
please take your right hand on top of your forehead

395
01:57:11,667 --> 01:57:14,542
and put down your head.

396
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:25,626
Here you have to forgive everyone in general,

397
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,918
not how many times, but from your heart.

398
01:57:37,167 --> 01:57:39,876
If you do not forgive

399
01:57:40,042 --> 01:57:44,292
then you will also miss your Self Realization,

400
01:57:44,501 --> 01:57:47,459
because Kundalini cannot pass

401
01:57:47,667 --> 01:57:50,584
through the constricted Agnya chakra.

402
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:15,709
Now, please take back your hand, on the back side of your head,

403
01:58:15,918 --> 01:58:21,667
and put it up as far as possible.

404
01:58:30,999 --> 01:58:34,250
Here without feeling guilty,

405
01:58:36,751 --> 01:58:39,751
without counting your mistakes,

406
01:58:41,292 --> 01:58:45,792
for your satisfaction you have to say,

407
01:58:46,334 --> 01:58:48,375
“Oh Divine Power,

408
01:58:48,584 --> 01:58:53,083
please forgive me, if I have done any mistakes.”

409
01:59:14,375 --> 01:59:19,125
Now,  this has to be said from your heart,

410
01:59:19,334 --> 01:59:21,501
not how many times.

411
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,959
Now, please stretch your palm fully.

412
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:54,375
And put the center of your palm

413
01:59:54,584 --> 01:59:58,626
on top of the fontanel bone area.

414
02:00:03,542 --> 02:00:07,083
Push back your fingers. Why are you not doing, madam?

415
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:12,167
Why is she not doing it? This lady.

416
02:00:16,334 --> 02:00:19,125
She wants to listen only. She only wants to listen.

417
02:00:19,334 --> 02:00:21,667
Then let her go away. She should go.

418
02:00:21,876 --> 02:00:25,501
She should not try to be arrogant like that, not proper.

419
02:00:41,542 --> 02:00:46,792
All right. Now put your right hand on your fontanel bone area

420
02:00:51,542 --> 02:00:54,292
and please put down your head.

421
02:00:58,209 --> 02:01:02,792
Here now, you have to move your scalp

422
02:01:03,792 --> 02:01:07,375
seven times, clockwise.

423
02:01:09,042 --> 02:01:11,417
But here again

424
02:01:11,626 --> 02:01:17,667
I cannot force Self Realization on you.

425
02:01:28,667 --> 02:01:32,334
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

426
02:01:35,584 --> 02:01:41,375
So while moving your scalp seven times you should just say,

427
02:01:41,584 --> 02:01:45,000
“Mother, please give me my Self Realization.”

428
02:02:01,334 --> 02:02:04,834
Seven times, please.

429
02:02:11,167 --> 02:02:13,959
Litlle like that. Yes.

430
02:02:54,751 --> 02:02:57,459
Now please take down your hands.

431
02:03:09,125 --> 02:03:11,876
Put both the hands like this towards Me.

432
02:03:13,959 --> 02:03:16,876
Open your eyes.

433
02:03:18,751 --> 02:03:24,000
Watch Me. Watch Me without thinking, you can do it.

434
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:34,542
Now please put right hand towards Me.

435
02:03:36,999 --> 02:03:40,501
And put down your head and see with your left hand

436
02:03:40,709 --> 02:03:45,751
if there is a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

437
02:03:55,542 --> 02:03:58,501
You shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head,

438
02:04:01,999 --> 02:04:04,999
but away from it.

439
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,999
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

440
02:04:16,834 --> 02:04:19,417
And now bend your head and see with your right hand

441
02:04:19,626 --> 02:04:22,083
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

442
02:04:22,292 --> 02:04:25,626
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

443
02:04:36,417 --> 02:04:40,167
Now please put your right hand towards Me again

444
02:04:40,375 --> 02:04:43,000
and with the left hand you can see it again.

445
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:06,417
Now raise both your hands towards the sky

446
02:05:10,125 --> 02:05:12,751
and ask a question

447
02:05:12,959 --> 02:05:16,709
one of these three questions, anyone of them, three times.

448
02:05:20,959 --> 02:05:24,292
Push back your head and ask the question,

449
02:05:24,542 --> 02:05:27,667
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

450
02:05:34,459 --> 02:05:37,334
Or ask the question three times,

451
02:05:37,542 --> 02:05:42,167
“Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?”

452
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:50,999
Or ask the question three times,

453
02:05:51,167 --> 02:05:53,751
“Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

454
02:06:00,167 --> 02:06:02,459
Please take down your hands.

455
02:06:04,375 --> 02:06:06,584
It’s hot.

456
02:06:07,501 --> 02:06:13,459
All those who have felt cool breeze

457
02:06:14,417 --> 02:06:19,626
or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area

458
02:06:19,918 --> 02:06:24,501
or on their fingertips or on their palms

459
02:06:24,999 --> 02:06:27,999
please raise both your hands.

460
02:06:41,375 --> 02:06:43,999
The whole of Austria.

461
02:06:44,167 --> 02:06:47,709
May God bless you all! May God bless you! May God bless you!

462
02:06:52,667 --> 02:06:54,918
Vienna!

463
02:06:55,375 --> 02:07:00,334
I bow to you all. You have now started your saintly life.

464
02:07:05,751 --> 02:07:09,792
Now respect, respect your Self Realization.

465
02:07:14,125 --> 02:07:18,209
Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

466
02:07:23,125 --> 02:07:26,000
You cannot do it individually.

467
02:07:28,042 --> 02:07:30,626
Of course, at home you can meditate,

468
02:07:30,834 --> 02:07:34,375
but you have to come to collective to grow.

469
02:07:40,292 --> 02:07:43,334
Like this finger, if it is sick,

470
02:07:43,542 --> 02:07:47,459
the whole body runs for the help of this.

471
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:52,999
In the same way now you have become the whole.

472
02:08:00,999 --> 02:08:05,167
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

473
02:08:09,999 --> 02:08:15,417
You’ll have so many blessings and so many miracles

474
02:08:15,751 --> 02:08:18,876
that you may not believe them even.

475
02:08:26,959 --> 02:08:33,292
And you’ll be amazed how fantastically you are so glorious.

476
02:08:40,417 --> 02:08:44,417
But you must learn how to use this power.

477
02:08:48,959 --> 02:08:52,999
You’ll hardly take a month to master it.

478
02:08:58,584 --> 02:09:01,876
You don’t have to pay for this at all.

479
02:09:05,167 --> 02:09:08,959
No one is going to pay for it,

480
02:09:09,918 --> 02:09:13,375
only thing you have to give little time

481
02:09:13,709 --> 02:09:16,417
for your Self Realization.

482
02:09:24,876 --> 02:09:29,876
May God bless you all!
