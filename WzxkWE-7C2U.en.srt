1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,780
This year we won’t be having I think,

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,300
public programs in UK,

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,020
because also there are certain circumstances.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,540
But whenever there is a circumstance

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,940
which, somehow or other, changes our programs,

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,540
we must immediately know

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,140
that there is a purpose behind all that change,

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,780
and we must immediately accept it

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,980
with an open heart – that Divine wants us to change.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,180
Supposing I am going on a road

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,460
and people say, “You are lost your way Mother.”

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,660
That’s all right. I am never lost, because I am with Myself!

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,700
But I had to go by that particular road, is the point.

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,300
I had to do it, and that’s why I have…supposed to be,

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,300
not on that road and I have lost My way.

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:23,380
If you have that kind of a understanding,

17
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,100
and if you have that satisfaction in your heart,

18
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,460
then you’ll find life is worth much more than what you think it to be.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Now, as it is, what was the reason, I thought,

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:49,020
that we have decided to have public programs

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,260
this year definitely, and we could not have public programs?

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,580
So the reason is that we have to consolidate.

23
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,540
In the growth of a tree, which is a living tree,

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:20,100
it happens that it moves in a particular direction up to a point,

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,420
till it has to change,

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,940
because there is no sun coming that side,

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,100
maybe there is no water levels arriving,

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,060
so they start changing.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,620
In the same way, one has to understand that,

30
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,180
we are in the hands of the Divine,

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,460
and if some plans are changed,

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,700
it is reflecting back on us, and we have to see why.

33
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,980
And the why of it is that we have to consolidate.

34
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,540
Consolidation of sahaja yogis is very important.

35
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,580
The first thing to consolidate yourself, you must do introspection.

36
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,860
You must do introspection, is to reflect the light within

37
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,540
and see for yourself:

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,780
what have you done so far in Sahaja Yoga?

39
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,220
Where were you, How far you have gone,

40
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,940
and how far have you to go.

41
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,940
What is the thing that is lacking in you?

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,900
You’ll be surprised when you start seeing yourself,

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,740
in a very unbiased manner, not justifying yourself

44
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,780
not blaming any bhoots,

45
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,420
or need not blame any badhas within you, or somebody else.

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,140
If you start yourself [seeing] what has gone wrong with you

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,700
that you could not consolidate yourself properly,

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,260
you’ll be amazed that there has been problems

49
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,340
still lingering on which must be corrected.

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,380
Now these problems you can see very clearly.

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,780
In the light of the Spirit you can see them very clearly

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,220
that, “This has gone wrong with me.”

53
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,460
One of the most interesting things I’ve noticed is that

54
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Sahaja Yoga is all the time covered with some sort of a maya.

55
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,060
And this maya is ignorance, complete ignorance sometimes,

56
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,660
sometimes partially.

57
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,820
Now when you get into Sahaja Yoga you get blessed.

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,260
You get blessed maybe,

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,380
your family gets blessed, your children get blessed.

60
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,100
You get some sort of a blessing for your physical being.

61
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,220
Also for financial [side], you get jobs, you get money,

62
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:13,420
you get something exceptional, which is really miraculous.

63
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,460
Now people get very much lost in those achievements

64
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,460
and start drifting, thinking that,

65
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,100
“Oh, this is the blessing we have got now.

66
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,260
We don’t have to do anything anymore,”

67
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,540
that you are being rewarded sufficiently

68
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,220
for whatever you have done so far. That’s not so!

69
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,540
Is just a sort of a support to you comes

70
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,140
so that your faith should be fully established in Sahaja Yoga.

71
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,820
And specially, you should know Me, what I am.

72
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,180
But, if you go on still drifting,

73
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,020
then maybe some of these blessings may turn out to be curses,

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,780
and you might feel that what a curse it has fallen upon us

75
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,020
and how it has gone in the wrong way.

76
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,940
For some people it takes time to feel,

77
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,700
to get to the feel of the blessings.

78
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,380
For example, mostly, according to the modern ideas,

79
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,140
we think that to get more money is the biggest blessing.

80
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,220
So, so many get that also.

81
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
But actually, it is not.

82
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,300
To get your peace within,

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,740
to get to your witness state,

84
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,620
and to feel your vibrations all right,

85
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,620
and to be in the center, all the time ascending,

86
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,620
is the real blessing.

87
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,620
Because with that, you get everything else.

88
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,020
The completion is only possible

89
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,420
when you have the complete joy bubbling within yourself.

90
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:12,140
After all, everything is just a means to achieve joy,

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,500
to feel the joy.

92
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,100
It is not the end.

93
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,700
If it was, those people who have money,

94
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,820
those people who have good health,

95
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,300
those people who have all the success, so-called, with them,

96
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,980
they should have had been happy and peaceful,

97
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,380
but they are not, they are suffering,

98
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:43,180
they are suffering too much, and they are, in a way,

99
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,540
destroying themselves, day by day,

100
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,900
because they hate their lives, they can’t bear it.

101
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,580
They cannot understand why they are on this Earth.

102
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,500
So all these blessings that come to you,

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,340
all these changes that come to you,

104
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,500
all these new venues that open to you,

105
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,100
one has to know that it is for your benevolence,

106
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,180
everything for your benevolence,

107
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,340
and your benevolence is your ascent,

108
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,380
nothing else but your ascent.

109
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,380
The rest of it is all useless and fruitless.

110
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,260
Once you understand that this is

111
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,620
what you have to achieve in life,

112
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,100
that is what you have to enjoy, then it works out.

113
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,140
But in Sahaja Yoga as you see, it’s compassion and love.

114
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,220
It is not so much restrictions.

115
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,300
You are left to yourself to develop yourself.

116
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,100
Is your Spirit which has to guide you.

117
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,820
There’s no coaxing or correction going on all the time.

118
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,860
But it is left to you to understand yourself,

119
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,540
to see for yourself, and work it out.

120
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,500
But one of the criteria should be

121
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,380
that “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

122
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,740
Now what have I done for Mother?”

123
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,300
These two things are very important to understand.

124
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,700
Whatever small thing I could do for Sahaja Yoga

125
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,100
is important because

126
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,940
if you are intelligent, you can see

127
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,340
that this is the greatest thing you have to do

128
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,820
is to work for God.

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,660
This is the most important thing so far

130
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,340
human beings have indulged into,

131
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,100
is the highest type of enterprise

132
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,980
that human beings have ever had a chance to indulge into

133
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,060
and what a chance it is too!

134
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
You may say that, “Mother we are mediocres,

135
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,940
we are no good, we are useless,”

136
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,460
but you are chosen.

137
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,420
You are the one chosen so there must be something about you.

138
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,740
You might not have seen that part within yourself

139
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,100
which is going to work out this great work of God.

140
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,180
So you have to locate and find out:

141
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,100
“Why am I selected for Sahaja Yoga?

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,100
What can I do in Sahaja Yoga?

143
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,100
What can I work it out in Sahaja Yoga?”

144
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,900
This should be a constant reminder to you that,

145
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,340
“I have been chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

146
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,380
I want to take full advantage of Sahaja Yoga.”

147
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,620
Supposing somebody doesn’t have money,

148
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,620
he expects that Sahaja Yoga should give money,

149
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,620
must give jobs, must give this, must give that,

150
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,940
must have children, must give good health,

151
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,100
all that. Expectations are all right.

152
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,060
But “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

153
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,620
This is another point of introspection.

154
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,100
Very important to see that

155
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,740
we have to do something for Sahaja Yoga.

156
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,340
It’s not money, it’s not work,

157
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,540
it’s not thinking, it’s not any kind of a support.

158
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,820
But one of them, the most important thing is,

159
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,140
how many people you have given realization to?

160
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,140
You have to count.

161
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,780
How many people you have been able to give realization to,

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,100
how many people you have talked about Sahaja Yoga.

163
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,940
You may think that you give realization to some people,

164
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,700
they come, they disappear – doesn’t matter.

165
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
They will ultimately come to you.

166
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,420
Today you try on some, they’ll be lost.

167
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,740
Again tomorrow. You have to relentlessly work for it.

168
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,540
As you know I’ve worked very hard in UK.

169
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,100
My coming to UK itself was all predetermined.

170
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,620
There was a need for Me to come here,

171
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,780
to make the heart work better.

172
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,500
But heart is lethargic, you know that,

173
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,740
and lethargic heart gets all kinds of problems.

174
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,220
But all these years I have been working,

175
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,740
every year, whatever time I could give for sahaja yogis,

176
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,380
for their problems, for Sahaja Yoga,

177
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,540
for their minutest problem,

178
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
for any kind of help they needed,

179
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,300
every sort, I have tried to work it out.

180
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,900
Directly, indirectly, you are all blessed.

181
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,620
Still, what about you people who are now yogis?

182
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,300
You are saints.

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
You must see a photograph that I have,

184
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,780
very interesting photograph, where you are all certified saints!

185
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,900
Have you seen that photograph?

186
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,020
Not yet? You better see it, let’s have it!

187
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,820
The photograph is in My box, I think, yes.

188
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,900
You are all certified saints!

189
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,940
By the Divine, not by any cardinal or by any pope.

190
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,020
So what are all these saints doing?

191
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,620
One saint which is certified by pope,

192
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,220
who is artificially certified,

193
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,740
is such a big thing, you know.

194
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,620
What about you, who have been certified by God Almighty?

195
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,420
You are still busy with your work,

196
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,740
you are still busy with your little, little things,

197
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:09,460
you are still busy with your small lives and small families.

198
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,420
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

199
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,740
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

200
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,740
for a person who is of a generous nature,

201
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,500
means a person who is a saint,

202
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,500
the whole world is his own family.

203
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,500
Are you still only worried about your own family?

204
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,260
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

205
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,420
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

206
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,100
about his own child, about his own house,

207
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,940
he worries about the whole world.

208
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,540
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

209
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,940
You are very powerful people.

210
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,620
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

211
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,220
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

212
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,860
or you have to be people who are

213
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,620
some sort of politicians, or something.

214
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,940
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

215
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,820
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

216
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:25,480
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

217
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,940
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

218
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,340
You can’t just be in Niranand.

219
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,260
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

220
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,340
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

221
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,020
And you have to think about them,

222
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,820
not only your problems that, “Mother

223
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,260
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

224
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,020
But you have to worry about the whole world.

225
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,020
You have to think, what’s happening in the world,

226
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,340
what are the problems of the world.

227
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,340
You are responsible for that.

228
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,620
Not only that, but you have to pray.

229
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,180
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

230
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,340
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

231
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,420
from yourself, from your smaller life,

232
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,140
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

233
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:24,100
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

234
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,100
that all these problems should be solved.

235
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,740
This is your job for which you are selected.

236
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,100
Your asking is going to work out

237
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,380
because as you know, I am desire-less.

238
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,700
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

239
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,460
The protection, the affection, the compassion

240
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,620
of Mother is with you.

241
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,420
But you have to look after this world

242
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,180
and show the concern that you have,

243
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,420
not to live with a very limited areas,

244
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,980
and with a very limited ways.

245
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,020
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

246
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,060
“UK problems are our problems.” No

247
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,220
Your problems extend to

248
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,420
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

249
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,500
And you have to worry about all of them.

250
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,340
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

251
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,180
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

252
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,300
So, you have to see to it that

253
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,900
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

254
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,700
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

255
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,660
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

256
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,900
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

257
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,100
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

258
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,700
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

259
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,820
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

260
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,340
Then there are general problems as you see.

261
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,900
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

262
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,820
or whatever you may say,

263
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,540
so you have to put your attention to America.

264
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,420
You have to stretch your attention outside,

265
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,980
not inside

266
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,900
just worried about yourself, about your family,

267
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,460
about your house, about your children.

268
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,580
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

269
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,420
your problems are solved in the house,

270
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,820
in the smaller circle they are solved.

271
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,980
You have to pay attention outside!

272
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
Now these days there are televisions,

273
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,900
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

274
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,460
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

275
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,100
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

276
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,620
But now there are important things that are happening

277
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,660
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

278
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,660
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

279
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,940
where you have to put your attention.

280
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,580
You should become aware of your personality,

281
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,180
it’s not a personality that can be

282
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,340
completely involved into a very small area.

283
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,180
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

284
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,020
into all the problems of the universe,

285
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,260
all the problems there are.

286
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,980
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

287
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,420
in a very collective way.

288
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,340
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

289
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,420
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.

290
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,980
Would you like to have a look, all of you?

291
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,540
Just see! All of you, sitting in Ganapatipule.

292
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,820
So stretch out your vibrations. Stretch out your attentions.

293
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,180
And you’ll be amazed that

294
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,580
all other stupid problems that you have will be finished.

295
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,820
Now have a look. Let the children see first of all.

296
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,220
Just see. You all have vibrations on top of your head.

297
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,460
Let them grow, I tell you, I’m just waiting for them to grow!

298
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,420
So the attitude toward ourselves should be

299
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,620
to be aware of our own glory, of our own position,

300
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,900
to know that we are saints,

301
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,420
that we have reached a stage where we are at the highest,

302
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,180
and that, now, we have become the light

303
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,500
and we have to give light to others.

304
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,580
If you see, in the Bible, Christ has said something,

305
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,220
which is very important, that you
don’t put the light under the table.

306
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,620
That’s what it is. You have to put the light on a pedestal.

307
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,620
And that’s what it is that

308
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,620
you have to put your light on the citadel,

309
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,180
at a very highest point to give light to others.

310
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,740
And this is working both ways

311
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,660
if you start understanding what you are,

312
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,020
what you have to be aware of, what is your situation,

313
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,020
what is your powers, what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga,

314
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:51,020
what is the debt you have towards Sahaja Yoga,

315
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,340
and what you have to give for Sahaja Yoga.

316
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,580
How Sahaja Yoga has made you so capable,

317
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,140
so good, so nice.

318
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,620
Are you righteous enough? Are you behaving properly?

319
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,500
Are you doing all the rightful things,

320
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
which are necessary?

321
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,420
Because it is only you who can do it.

322
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:20,260
You are the people with a very very special energies

323
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,100
and special contacts with the spiritual life,

324
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,620
and if you start behaving like all other mundane, nonsensical people,

325
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,900
limiting yourself to your family, your children,

326
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:39,220
your nonsensical previous lives,

327
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,700
you’ll be lost.

328
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,020
Lost to yourself and lost to everyone.

329
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,140
The problems are much more than what you know about.

330
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:56,100
That is the understanding you have to reach,

331
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,820
that Mother has made us yogis.

332
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,700
We are saints.

333
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,420
And we have to show to the world the right path.

334
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,180
She has told us that we are the light

335
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,180
and we have to show to people which way to go,

336
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,740
how to go further.

337
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,740
Instead of that everybody seems to be a problem,

338
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,700
seems to be in a very small little whirlpool,

339
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,980
going round and round and round.

340
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,260
How can that be?

341
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,980
I’ve told you many a times, look at these false gurus.

342
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,340
They have no vibrations, they don’t know anything

343
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,900
about Kundalini, nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

344
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,100
But how much they are doing!

345
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,580
While what are we doing?

346
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,620
We’re struggling still with ourselves and with our problems,

347
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,180
with our own ideas, with our very small-mindedness

348
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,220
and chicken-heartedness.

349
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,300
Now it is for you to understand.

350
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,940
It is for you to decide about yourself.

351
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,620
It is your own desire, it is your own bigness,

352
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,020
your own magnanimity, which has to come forward.

353
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,820
To see for yourself what you are capable of,

354
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,420
what you can do.

355
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,380
It’s very easy for people to say that,

356
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,620
“Oh Mother, it’s too much. I can’t do anything about it.”

357
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,220
Or somebody to say that, “Mother, I’m busy with my family.”

358
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,500
Or somebody to say, “I’m busy with my children.”

359
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,660
You have come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

360
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,980
I have given you realization for that?

361
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,380
All these blessings have come to you for that?

362
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,180
So the consolidation that you have to do is very important.

363
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,100
You can see it clearly that’s why

364
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,180
we could not have any public programs,

365
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,100
because we really need consolidation in UK.

366
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,220
Though I have lived in UK for so many years,

367
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,300
people take me for granted here.

368
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,740
Because I am here, because I am staying here,

369
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,420
they think if we go to the airport, finished!

370
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,340
We have done all the haj, everything.

371
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,420
“We’ve been to the airport; we’ve seen Mother, finished!”

372
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,420
What’s the use of seeing Me?

373
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,980
What have I given you?

374
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,060
Is your light spreading?

375
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,780
How many people have got realization from you?

376
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,340
Just find out, how many people

377
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,340
have learned Sahaja Yoga from you,

378
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,100
or from your lives, or from your wisdom,

379
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,580
or from your behavior?

380
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,740
That is the way, that is the criteria.

381
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,900
It’s not that

382
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,420
“All right, I have sent Mother Her money for Her travel.”

383
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,820
That’s not sufficient.

384
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,900
At My age, from India, if you see any lady at My age,

385
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,460
she walks with a stick, she can’t climb even one step

386
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,700
Indian women can’t, because of the heat that they have suffered.

387
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,340
But I’m traveling, you know how I’m traveling,

388
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,540
how much I am doing. What about My family?

389
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,180
I deprive them of My company, I deprive My husband of My company,

390
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,260
everybody is just without Me.

391
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,980
I am traveling traveling every day,

392
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,780
you know that very well, and I’m working so very hard.

393
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,300
Sometimes I sleep at two o’clock, sometimes at three o’clock.

394
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,100
This time Harsh was with Me,

395
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,500
and I saw him, he was fagged out!

396
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,700
So I was saying you people do only relay race.

397
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,540
I am in Australia, all right, Australians are working.

398
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,980
Then I’m in Austria, then Austrians are working,

399
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,060
then they are having a nice time there!

400
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,660
I’m in UK, all right, little bit in UK, little work done.

401
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,140
Then they all sit down nicely, enjoy.

402
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,500
What about Me? I am having a marathon!

403
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
In the same way you have to feel,

404
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,500
after all, what is My gain in it?

405
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,980
What do I gain out of it?

406
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,060
I gain something:

407
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,980
I have brought My children back to normal conditions,

408
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,260
I have taken them to the Kingdom of God.

409
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,820
You have to do the same.

410
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,340
You have to take them to the Kingdom of God.

411
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,100
But if you, yourself, are involved into your own mayas,

412
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,420
you’ll be everyday going down and down and down and down.

413
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,820
I may shout, I may say anything, it will not go into your heads,

414
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,060
it will never click with you.

415
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
You’ll be all stranded wherever you are,

416
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,060
because you don’t want to see.

417
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,340
For that I would say, you have one advantage,

418
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,500
especially in UK. You are all very intelligent people.

419
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,980
You have intelligence, no doubt,

420
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,980
you are not idiots like Americans.

421
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,860
You are intelligent.

422
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,060
This intelligence became cunningness once upon a time,

423
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,420
and now you are tired of your cunning.

424
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,700
Indians have learned the cunning from you,

425
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,660
they have become really very cunning.

426
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,700
But you are tired of your cunningness,

427
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,700
so now you are tired, fed up, fagged out, and lethargic.

428
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,700
But with your intelligence you can understand

429
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,060
that this is such an important work our Mother is doing.

430
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,340
You’ll go down in the history!

431
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,580
Every word you say, everything you say,

432
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,100
every way you behave,

433
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,060
everything is going to go down in the history!

434
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,180
Not how many children you produced,

435
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,900
or what sort of a wife you have,

436
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,300
but what you did for Sahaja Yoga.

437
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,780
Remember that.

438
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,340
History is going to record everything,

439
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,780
whatever you have done

440
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,580
and whatever you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga.

441
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,780
It’s not showing off.

442
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,340
It’s not just a demonstration.

443
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,100
It’s not talking big.

444
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,780
It’s nothing of the kind.

445
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,340
It’s actually, really, totally what you have achieved,

446
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,180
is the point, will be recorded.

447
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,980
At least God knows hypocrisy, and God knows bombastic temperaments.

448
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,900
It’s God who knows where you are,

449
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,780
and what you are up to.

450
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,980
You cannot befool God, one thing you must realize.

451
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,340
But when you are befooling God, you are befooling your Self,

452
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,300
your Spirit, your realization, your own ascent!

453
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,300
So we have to be careful.

454
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,900
As a Mother I would say try to be

455
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,980
introspecting yourself very carefully

456
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,380
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

457
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,980
What have we done for other people who are drifting?

458
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,460
What has been our behavior towards other sahaja yogis?

459
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,060
How much peace and love and compassion we have given to others?

460
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,780
How much understanding and tolerance we have shown to others?

461
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,580
If somebody gets here a little more money,

462
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,100
he becomes so bombastic, he becomes so aggressive,

463
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,340
he becomes so rude.

464
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,420
I can’t believe it!

465
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,220
How can money lure you into these vices?

466
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,900
You are not ordinary people, you are the saints

467
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,940
whose feet were washed by the River Ganges.

468
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,340
Try to understand your glory. Try to understand your own powers,

469
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,260
your own position as saintly people, sahaja yogis,

470
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,060
which are above all the saints

471
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,180
because you know how to give realization,

472
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,140
you know everything about Kundalini,

473
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,380
you know everything about realization.

474
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,300
How many people knew about it?

475
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,180
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking

476
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,340
I have given all this knowledge to some bunch of fools

477
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,860
who do not know what is the value.

478
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,980
As Christ has said, “Don’t throw pearls before the swines.”

479
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,420
But I don’t think I have done that mistake.

480
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,420
I cannot believe I have done that mistake,

481
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,700
that I have thrown pearls before swines.

482
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,020
I have not done it.

483
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:43,260
But, it is for you to decide where you stand, in what category.

484
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,340
It is so obvious that

485
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,540
it’s a very precarious time we are passing through.

486
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,420
It’s very important [that] we have to fight it out.

487
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,580
It’s much more than any wars you have fought.

488
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,060
It’s much more than any struggle human beings ever had.

489
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,700
It’s such a horrible world that is being created,

490
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,060
and we have to transform it.

491
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,180
It’s a tremendous task.

492
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,180
For that you have to work out

493
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,260
in a very sincere and a innate manner.

494
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,060
And I’m sure one day will come

495
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,300
that in the history of this world

496
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,900
sahaja yogis will have their names written with golden letters.

497
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,580
I am sure this will work out.

498
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,980
I am sure this has to work out,

499
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,580
and that you all have to achieve it,

500
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,980
collectively, with one mind, with one heart.

501
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,580
What should I sacrifice?

502
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,100
What should I do?

503
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,340
How should I help?

504
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,780
What is my contribution?

505
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:02,020
I wish I could see those days in My lifetime.
