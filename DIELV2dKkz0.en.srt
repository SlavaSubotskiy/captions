1
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,200
At the very outset we have to remember

3
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,100
that we are here to seek the truth.

4
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,720
It´s not a sermon, is not a lecture,

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,800
It´s not fundamentalism.

6
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,740
I am happy to see that there are so many

7
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,920
seekers in this country.

8
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Truth is what it is.

9
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,000
You can not change it, you can not transform it.

10
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,900
You can not read about it.

11
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,300
You can not conceptualize it.

12
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,800
You have to feel it, you have to become.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,080
I was also born in a protestant family in India.

14
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,860
And that's how I know much more about Christianity

15
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
that anyone of you can know.

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,840
And I feel, we have missed the point.

17
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,380
Because, because you can not seek

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Christianity

19
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,880
and also truth.

20
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,820
Christianity is very different from Christ.

21
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,300
It´s absolutely mental.

22
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,340
And specially, I  have attended Lutheran Church.

23
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,400
[UNCLEAR]

24
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Lutheran Church.

25
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,620
Of course, one has to understand

26
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,260
that all these years our forefathers have been following

27
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Christianity.

28
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,940
Especially in my country, they just came with the Bible in one hand

29
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,600
and revolver in another. Cunning.

30
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,500
And that kind of aggressiveness we see.

31
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,820
Thank God Columbus

32
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,880
luckily went to America, otherwise I would not have been here,

33
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,000
no Indian would have been spared.

34
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,380
You will be amazed that in Argentina and Chile,

35
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
I have been to.

36
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,440
You can't find a single aboriginal [UNCLEAR inhabitant], not one!

37
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,380
You have to go to the museum to see them.

38
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,200
Is that what Christ has taught us?

39
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,200
He has said on the cross

40
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
that, "Oh Father forgive them for they do not know,

41
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,300
what they are doing."

42
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,600
He never wanted any fundamentalism.

43
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,600
He has said that those who are not against us are with us.

44
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,600
People allowed him to live only for tree and the half year.

45
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,100
Only that short period He had to talk to people.

46
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,360
It is too short that people do. It is too short a time

47
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,540
to talk to people about divinity about subtleties.

48
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Too short!

49
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,000
Because people, people are so ignorant.

50
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,500
And they live with that ignorance in sin.

51
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,400
They belong to some Church, belong to some association,

52
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,500
that's all!

53
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,260
When I have been to London first, it took me four years

54
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,900
to talk to people, seven people only, educate them.

55
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,000
About Sahaja Yoga. Four years!

56
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,100
I must say. English are hard nuts. No doubt.

57
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,900
They are hard nuts. English are hard nuts, hard nuts.

58
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,200
But, they opened themselves.

59
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,240
Open to such an extend that today the best sahaja yogis

60
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,400
we are having, are English.

61
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Because they realized,

62
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,500
that we have to have something within us, which is universal.

63
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,400
How can we fight in the name of God?

64
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,000
When God has created all of us.

65
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,400
How can we fight?

66
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,820
It is surprising how everybody´s message has been so much been

67
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,500
put into some sort of a mess.

68
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,820
I have studied Bible and I realized

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,700
that Paul had nothing to do with Christ!

70
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,940
My father was a scholar and also a realized soul.

71
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,800
I asked him, "What is this Paul doing here?"

72
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,580
He said, he said that Paul,

73
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,200
is a spotter.

74
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,200
Firstly, he was suffering from epilepsy.

75
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
Now we have proved that epilepsy comes to people

76
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,800
when they are possessed.

77
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
In India tree doctors have got MD (Doctor of Medicine)

78
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,900
for curing people through Sahaja Yoga of incurable diseases.

79
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,420
They have done MD.

80
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,460
MD, Master.

81
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,800
And one of them [UNCLEAR] in epilepsy.

82
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:33,200
And he found that this epilepsy comes from possessions.

83
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,600
And if the possession is removed, person can be cured.

84
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,740
Thus with Sahaja Yoga people suffering from

85
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,100
blood cancer have been cured.

86
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
All kinds of incurable diseases had been cured automatically.

87
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,500
By this happening.

88
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,300
Christ has clearly said that you are to be born again.

89
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,300
Even in Sanskrit, we call a realized soul as a "dwijha".

90
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,400
The one who is born again.

91
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,900
And,

92
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,820
and even a bird is called "dwijha". It means the same.

93
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,900
Bird born again, twice.Born twice. Born bird.

94
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,260
Now, it is not just some priest puts water on your head

95
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,800
and say you are born again.

96
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,960
William Blake that great poet from England, has written a [UNCLEAR],

97
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,800
Priest cursed on my fontanel area.

98
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
But it is happening that has to take place.

99
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Like an egg becomes the bird, is a different personality.

100
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,900
You have to get your transformation.

101
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
That may be the reason,

102
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,460
Christ has said in the second chapter, Mathew´s second verse,

103
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,800
"You will be calling me Jesus, Jesus, I will not recognize you!"

104
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,100
That's what exactly is the situation today.

105
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,900
And also you can see, it´s very clear cut

106
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,300
that you might be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

107
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,300
You can all commit any sin.

108
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,400
You can do any harm to anyone.

109
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,100
How can that be.

110
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,000
There is no [UNCLEAR]

111
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,660
from these [UNCLEAR brands]. These are [UNCLEAR brands].

112
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,100
Artificially put on you.

113
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,520
But if you are really a Christian,

114
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,400
then the whole universe is yours.

115
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,200
For, within  us lies the spirit. He said it so.

116
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,500
And that you have to be the spirit, he said it so.

117
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,240
Ones you become the spirit

118
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,400
then there is complete transformation of personalities.

119
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,540
I think, Christ has said quite a lot

120
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,600
in this three and the half years of His public life.

121
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,900
He has done so many things for us about, which we are not even aware.

122
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,580
You will know, what he has done within ourselves,

123
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,700
what he has created within ourselves.

124
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,800
And you can only understand Christ if you get your self realization.

125
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,760
We have now people who are Jews

126
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,900
who are Muslims, Hindus all worship Christ.

127
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,400
We are working in fifty-fife nations.

128
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,860
Because,

129
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,200
firstly, this Paul chose Peter, who was the worst disciple of Christ.

130
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,800
Christ has said about him that a devil will take over.

131
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,500
"Satan, Satan will take over you." Christ said.

132
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,260
So he put in the name of Peter

133
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,560
that Christ has said

134
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,960
that you will build a temple or a church in his name

135
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,360
and he will give you the keys.

136
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,500
He gives you the keys to Peter.

137
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,300
How can that be?

138
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,660
The disciple, who was the worst of all,

139
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,500
how can he make the head of Church?

140
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,300
There is no logic.

141
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,060
Then also, this organization that started

142
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,200
became power oriented and money oriented.

143
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,220
This power is worldly power, is what for Christ?

144
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,300
What is the value of this worldly power to him?

145
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,820
And what is this money after which

146
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,100
these churches and these temples and all these people are running?

147
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,800
Very surprising that these false people are now becoming

148
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,500
much more experts in falsehood.

149
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,880
Like in Orthodox Church now in Russia,

150
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,740
one of the politician told me that there is vacuum.

151
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,600
And then this Church is,

152
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,920
what you call a Black Order, that Church, that big Orthodox.

153
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,400
They are making all women nude and putting them in some sort of a

154
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,800
pond to baptize.

155
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,400
If you are a seeker of truth, you are born in the right moment.

156
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,880
All the seekers of truth think that there is something bigger

157
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,300
beyond us.

158
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,860
They also react to falsehood.

159
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,300
They also react to falsehood.

160
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,900
But their faith is very much shattered.

161
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,740
So they need something like "Hippiesm", this, that, agriculture,

162
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,200
all kind of things. But that's not the way.

163
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,180
They took to drugs and then to

164
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,300
other things.

165
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,500
Then in the west intellectuals like Fraud came in.

166
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,620
In that Christian countries.

167
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,100
How could they tolerate Freud?

168
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,600
If he had come to India,

169
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,600
I don´t know, where he would have landed, poor man,

170
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,000
[UNCLEAR he could have... they would have  killed immediately.]

171
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,440
He, I've been telling about him.

172
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,120
Recently, I've seen a very beautiful book written by

173
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,700
an American doctor. Calls it Fraudulent Fraud.

174
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,800
[Might be Freudian Fraud by E. Fuller]

175
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Freud became Christ for people.

176
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,660
For, I was told for thirty fife years people were fighting

177
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,400
to become nude.

178
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,860
May be, may be be for the higher race, I do not know

179
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,400
but for us Indians, it is stupid.

180
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,560
Christ has said, "Thou should not have adulterous eyes!''

181
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,400
To such a subtle morality, he has got.

182
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,240
That in your eyes, there should not bee lust and greed,

183
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,400
that's what He said.

184
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,180
When I first came in England,

185
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,460
I was surprised, everybody is looking at everyone

186
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,600
and I didn't know what they are doing what are they up to?

187
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,400
So I asked [UNCLEAR her], yes, ''What are they doing?''

188
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,800
She said, ''This is flirting''.

189
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,060
I said but what's the use?

190
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,100
Looking at some women, who is not your wife?

191
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,600
What's the use? I do not understand logically.

192
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,600
May be we Indians are not so intelligent.

193
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,020
So the second shock comes,

194
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,300
your faith is challenged by these people like Freud.

195
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,800
Take out yearns out of their heads.

196
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,600
In this book Freudian Fraud, he has given the names

197
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:31,480
of so many scientists who have proved that he was,

198
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,540
he had no scientific proof of  psychoanalysis

199
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,700
and for [UNCLEAR dispensaries].

200
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,800
And he said, nobody will publish their papers.

201
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,500
Now in his book he has proved absolutely that

202
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,820
it has nothing to do with mother and child and the child´s behavior,

203
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
nothing of the kind.

204
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,760
So now, we are at a juncture to see

205
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:33,300
what is our goal.

206
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,600
What do we have to achieve.

207
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,960
Are we going to do, be just calling Jesus, Jesus?

208
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,900
Or we are going to know him actually!

209
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,740
Now, there is a way within us, this, this is the [UNCLEAR] of tree of life

210
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,900
which is describe in the Bible.

211
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,200
And also it is said that I will  appear before you

212
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,380
like tongues of flames.

213
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,600
And when you get your self realization, you see these centers,

214
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,620
these chakras really as tongues of flames.

215
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,200
Really you see them within yourself.

216
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,800
But we have no self knowledge.

217
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,500
We have to be humble about it.

218
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,300
All the world problems are from human beings.

219
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,340
And all human problems are because of their,

220
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,460
these fundamental centers.

221
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,900
Now, if you can somehow correct these centers within yourself

222
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,820
and get connected with the all pervading power of God Almighty

223
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,500
then there is no problem.

224
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,660
That way atheist are better, atheist are better.

225
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,400
Like Russians. Because they have no conditionings.

226
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,500
They are free people, they are free people.

227
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,800
So now these centers reside within you

228
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,560
and whatever I am telling you,

229
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,900
you should not also believe me blindfolded.

230
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
But feel all this as

231
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,000
say a hypothesis.

232
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,460
And if it is proved

233
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,800
then as honest people, you should accept it.

234
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,900
Because it is not only for

235
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,500
your benevolence but it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

236
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,560
Also the third

237
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,800
problem is that lot's of false people have come from India.

238
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,400
They are also money oriented.

239
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,800
We have now this Hare Ramas.

240
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,580
In India everybody says that,

241
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
so what.

242
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,800
But I asked the people in India, who are supporting them.

243
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,800
Why are you supporting these people, which is all false?

244
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,340
They are fundamentalist.

245
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,580
They said that while they converted us to Christianity,

246
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,300
so we want to convert them to Hinduism.

247
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,600
I said some donkeys were first converted as donkeys

248
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,500
and now some donkeys again are going converted as donkeys.

249
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,300
By changing these brands, are we going to achieve it?

250
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,600
But they don´t think about the whole world of totality.

251
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,900
They think about themselves. They think they are the best.

252
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,500
They all think they are the best.

253
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,800
If you have to ask about the Jews go and ask a Christian.

254
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,800
And if you want to know about the Christian, go and ask Muslim.

255
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,720
And you ask a Muslim

256
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,700
then he will tell you to  interview about the Muslim.

257
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,300
Ask me about Hindu.

258
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,440
One better then the other.

259
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,300
There is no religion, there is no God within them.

260
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,100
They are all fighting cocks.

261
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,500
Want to find out some way of fight.

262
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,700
They talk of peace without having peace within.

263
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,900
They have to find their peace within themselves.

264
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,100
Now, so when this Kundalini, which is your own mother,

265
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,300
everybody has their individual mother.

266
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,000
And she gives you your second birth.

267
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,380
There is another problem, which I face always

268
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,140
that most of the western  people think

269
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,100
that Christ was born in England.

270
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,700
In England lived.

271
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,700
He was blond, white, maybe from Helsinki.

272
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,240
Because any knowledge coming from India, they want to abhor.

273
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,800
They want to oppose all knowledge that comes from  India or East.

274
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,400
I agree that western civilization has grown like a big tree.

275
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,100
But it does not know its roots.

276
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,400
Even Christ went to India.

277
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,420
And you will be amazed

278
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,420
that one of my forefathers from long time back,

279
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,820
he was a king of a country, Shalivahana.

280
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,500
He asked Christ, he met Christ in Kashmir.

281
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,740
In the, in the historical,

282
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,300
I mean whatever they have, written down is there.

283
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,200
He asked, "What´s your name?"

284
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,300
He said, "My name is Issah."

285
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,100
So, he said, "Are you a foreigner?"

286
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,400
He said, "I am not in this country."

287
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,200
"But in my country I am a foreigner."

288
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,200
"They can not understand me."

289
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,440
Also His mother died in India.

290
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
They [UNCLEAR] the anger of this  people.

291
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,740
You know, they were very angry in there for nothing at all.

292
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,600
I don´t know, it was off their heads.

293
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,200
Very angry people.

294
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,560
Always!

295
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,000
I have a diplomatic passport, but still they were

296
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,600
very hot-tempered, angry people.

297
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520
I told out the sahaja yogis, see now,

298
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,000
you will see their temper as they will see me.

299
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,700
Temper can not be Godly.

300
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,720
Fine, so now, here are these centers and

301
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,140
when this Kundalini rises, she nourishes all these centers,

302
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,320
passes through that crossing point, where resides Christ,

303
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
on the optic chiasma.

304
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,200
He is a gate.

305
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,860
And when the Kundalini awakens him,

306
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,340
he sucks in these two institutions, which are form

307
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,400
by these two channels, ego and superego,

308
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,000
you can call ego and conditionings.

309
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,540
That is, he died for our sins.

310
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,600
That is what it is. We should explain, he died for our sins.

311
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,600
Because he sucks in all the karmas, all the bad [UNCLEAR] sucks.

312
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,440
And also sucks whatever

313
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,300
what is our conditionings.

314
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,000
Then by that sucking the top of the fontanel opens out.

315
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,800
And a cool breeze starts coming in.

316
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
From your being.

317
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,240
Also you can feel all over this cool breeze

318
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:04,000
which is a Holy Ghost her power of love.

319
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,300
Now about Holy Ghost is another [UNCLEAR].

320
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,980
This Archbishop of Canterbury was asked who is the Holy Ghost?

321
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,000
By somebody on the telly, there I saw it myself.

322
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,480
Robin Day, [UNCLEAR] .

323
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,200
he was [UNCLEAR] interviewed by Robin Day, like a bulldog.

324
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:43,200
Robin Day. And he said that I am a Gnostic.

325
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,500
Archbishop of Canterbury said, "I am a Gnostic."

326
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,520
A Gnostic means.... You said unknowledgeable.

327
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,400
Archbishop said. I watched it myself on the television.

328
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,100
He said, "I don´t know. I don´t know."

329
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,840
Then the Archbishop told this men, "I don ´t know, I am Gnostic."

330
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,100
It means, I don´t know, I am not knowledgeable.

331
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,740
So this interviewer, quite a good man,

332
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,000
he asked him " And what are you doing here?"

333
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,800
He said, "I am doing my job as you are doing your job."

334
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,300
Christ´s first disciples were Gnostics.

335
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,500
Gn comes from the word, in sanskrit gn is knowledge.

336
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,220
It is not mental knowledge. It is not bookish knowledge.

337
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,600
But knowledge where you evolve

338
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,900
and you can feel this all-pervading power.

339
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,900
So, who is the [UNCLEAR], who is this Holy Ghost?

340
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,920
They have the Father and the Son.

341
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,500
And the dove as the Holy Ghost.

342
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Dove, dove.It´s the white bird, I think.

343
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Why not The Mother?

344
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,500
Because Paul hated women.

345
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,600
Big problem these days for Christians,

346
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,500
how to appoint a woman as a priest.

347
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,100
Biggest problem!

348
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,900
Because of Mister Paul.

349
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,300
This Primordial Mother is the feminine mother within you.

350
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,060
She is the reflection of the Holy Ghost of the Primordial Mother.

351
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,540
Greeks are much better. They called her Athena, the Primordial Mother.

352
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,000
Atha means primordial in Sanskrit.

353
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,600
I also saw her name here. I directly saw her.

354
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,500
Of course, we call her Adi Shakti. It´s the primordial power.

355
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,500
She is the power of desire of God Almighty.

356
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:24,200
She creates the whole universe and God Almighty is the witness.

357
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,420
Later on you hear lot about Christ, how big he was.

358
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,500
What was before his birth, who was he.

359
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,780
In our scriptures the Goddess it´s alright

360
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,540
but Christians won´t see. They have blinkers here.

361
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,500
They have not supposed to see anything else but Bible.

362
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,700
Thank God my mother and father both were scholars of Sanskrit.

363
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,960
This Kundalini raises, pierces through this fontanel bone area

364
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,740
and she nourishes all these centers on here.

365
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,000
Because she is the vital force.

366
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,660
As this instrument has to be connected to the mains,

367
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,800
in the same way, we are to be connected to the mains.

368
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:06,300
So, this Kundalini is also the pure desire, our pure desire.

369
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,940
Now, when these centers go out of order,

370
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,800
they are formed by left and right sympathetic

371
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,100
and the parasympathetic in the center.

372
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,200
When you start using this power, they get constricted.

373
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,300
These centers become constricted.

374
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
And their energy is exhausted.

375
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,260
And all these viruses come from the left.

376
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,720
All the viruses come from the left side.

377
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,800
From the subconscious, from the collective subconscious.

378
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,980
So, sometimes when they break,

379
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,700
this starts working on its own. This side.

380
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,620
All these incurable diseases are [UNCLEAR]

381
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,200
of the left side attack of the viruses.

382
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,200
And these viruses are

383
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,060
the animals, the plants and human beings,

384
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,100
who have gone into the collective subconscious.

385
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,520
Of course now, doctors have reached up to a point to say

386
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,280
that these viruses come from the area

387
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,860
which is build within us since our creation.

388
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,000
Since the creation.

389
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,460
For cancer they have viruses with the over 53 above [UNCLEAR] like that,

390
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,880
they have numbers.

391
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,340
That´s all. They are only numbers, I think.

392
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,600
But they are honest, because they don´t know anything more.

393
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,500
So the left side are emotional problems,

394
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,720
the right side are our physical and mental problems

395
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,300
and center ones are our spiritual problems.

396
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,600
If these problems can be solved

397
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,300
and if you are all connected to this power

398
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,500
then there is no question

399
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,100
of having any problems whatsoever.

400
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,620
Then you realize that all those religions that we know of,

401
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,900
were created on the same tree of life.

402
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,300
The tree of spirituality.

403
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,240
But we pluck the flowers and say, this is mine, this is mine.

404
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,700
Fighting with the death flowers.

405
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,640
All the incarnations, all the prophets,

406
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,140
all the seers

407
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,500
are on the same frequency.

408
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,600
Then we realize that there is universal religion within us.

409
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,980
Because the spirit that is reflected in our heart,

410
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,900
is the reflection of God Almighty.

411
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,700
And this spirit is a universal being.

412
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:52,680
You will be amazed to know that we have 55 nations

413
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,900
who are working out Sahaja Yoga.

414
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,580
Also in Russia, we had people,

415
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,900
sixteen thousand, twenty two thousand.

416
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,300
And all of them got realization.

417
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,700
So, what you find

418
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,620
that people from all these countries,

419
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,800
how there are unition.

420
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,440
There is no fight, there is no argument,

421
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,000
just they enjoy each other.

422
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,400
And they talk the language

423
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:56,400
of chakras, centers.

424
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,060
They do not talk Latina and this and that

425
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,900
as we think that these disciples of Christ did. They did not.

426
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,560
When they got realization, they started talking

427
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,000
the language of the centers.

428
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,700
Now, if this center is catching

429
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,600
that means, one has terrible ego.

430
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,200
That is the center of Christ.

431
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,600
And surprisingly, Christians have the worst of this.

432
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,620
So, the person who will come and tell me,

433
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,040
Mother my Agnya chakra is catching,

434
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,100
meaning, I have a ego a terrible ego.

435
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,300
Normally nobody would do it.

436
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,120
They would never say, I have got terrible ego,

437
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,200
nobody would say like that.

438
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,900
Or else, you become, your awareness becomes

439
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,400
collectively conscious.

440
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,200
This is your evolution.

441
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:49,900
You evolve into a higher state of awareness.

442
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,900
You can feel it on your fingertips.

443
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:04,460
The diseases of other people, the problems of other people.

444
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,120
I have shown you, you can see clearly, these are the centers.

445
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,000
Denoted on the left, same on the right.

446
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,300
Today I met in the morning a very great scientist from Russia.

447
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,300
And I told him that Sahaja Yoga is metascience, above science.

448
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,680
He said how? I said see, with my fingers

449
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,500
I can say what this man is suffering from.

450
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,240
But before diagnoses only, the doctors will kill you

451
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,600
before diagnoses, you know they will.

452
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,360
And surprisingly Mohamed Sahib said in his Koran

453
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,380
that at the time of resurrection, Qiyama, your hands will speak

454
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,000
and will give witness against you.

455
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,980
But Muslims never want to talk of Qiyama.

456
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,500
They do not want to talk of resurrection.

457
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,980
Because when he said, "I am the seal.", means a stamp of a prophet.

458
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,900
They want to say seal, [UNCLEAR it means] seal off.

459
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:53,800
Then how did he talk of Qiyama? How did he talk of Qiyama?

460
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,500
But Muslims are very much away from Mohammed Saab.

461
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,400
At least their intellectuals say that, they say that at least.

462
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,060
So now whit these thinks that happens to you,

463
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,300
you become collectively conscious.

464
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,400
As if you become part and parcel of the whole.

465
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,600
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

466
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,700
So who is the other?

467
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Then what is there to fight?

468
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,620
The spirit is the source of

469
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,900
pure knowledge and truth.

470
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,300
Absolute knowledge.

471
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,760
So, when you put your fingers, hands like this,

472
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,740
you get the all the messages through this all pervading power

473
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,300
and you know the absolute thing.

474
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,580
And when you get the absolute truth, if everybody feels the same way,

475
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,400
what is there to fight and quarrel?

476
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,600
Even the small children know.

477
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,660
Now there is a supposing false person has come.

478
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,820
How will you recognize?

479
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,900
If some false man comes here, I say that`s Jesus.

480
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,000
How will you recognize?

481
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,600
Ask him to walk on the water?

482
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,100
That simply best.

483
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,940
But, if you have vibrations,

484
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,900
you can make up each and every person.

485
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,200
Because this power is the power of love.

486
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,100
Of pure love.

487
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,000
We have never used this power.

488
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,500
Even in religion we have not used.

489
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,400
We have used the power of hatred.

490
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,380
So, once you get this power flow through you,

491
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:15,600
you become empowered yourself, you can give realizations to others.

492
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,400
You can cure people.

493
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,800
And this power is the ocean of knowledge.

494
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,000
Of pure divine knowledge.

495
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,560
Then you understand Bible better, then you understand Christ better,

496
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,400
then you understand all of them.

497
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,100
Our subtle eyes have to be opened.

498
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,300
But if you are satisfied with your ignorance,

499
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,400
nobody can force you.

500
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,300
Unless and until you ask for it, it won´t work out.

501
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,540
Christ has said, "The meek will inherit the Earth."

502
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,280
The meek. The meek people, it means humble.

503
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,700
Meek will inherit the earth.

504
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,180
So, only those who are humble will get realization.

505
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,200
Those who are arrogant can never get it.

506
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,500
This is not meant for arrogant, not meant for stupid people.

507
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,600
Or slavish.

508
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,000
We do not know how much slavery we have.

509
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,000
The entrepreneurs has made up slaves.

510
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,140
If they say [UNCLEAR] wear a six inches of skirt,

511
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,020
all the ladies would  [UNCLEAR built ] the six inches of skirt,

512
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,200
[UNCLEAR whether/ weather]  is cold or not.

513
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,960
We have no self esteem, I would say,

514
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,300
or we do not have our own personality

515
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,100
to check why you to wear this nonsense?

516
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,280
We have given up all those so many good  traditions,

517
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,260
just out of this people

518
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,940
bombarding your heads with publicity and all that.

519
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:06,240
[Shri Mataji is explaining to the translator]

520
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,200
I hope, you all get your realization today.

521
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,660
It is sahaja. It is sahaja.

522
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:33,500
Sahaja means born with ,saha means with,[UNCLEAR] is born.

523
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,900
It is spontaneous.

524
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:46,000
We have flowers here, see what a miracle they are.

525
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,400
Our eyes, what a miracle.

526
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,700
We take everything for granted.

527
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,500
These have came out spontaneously.

528
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,620
In the same way this works, this is evolutionary process.

529
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,000
The last breakthrough which is spontaneous.

530
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:26,300
It is absolutely spontaneous and it is your own.

531
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,200
This divinity is all the time within yourself in the potential state.

532
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,300
It is all the time in there.

533
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,900
Because it is eternal.

534
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,480
Whatever you might have done,

535
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,900
it can not be tarnished, it can not be destroyed.

536
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,060
It´s all your own.

537
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,200
It`s all your own.

538
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,420
Like a seed has it`s primula,

539
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:11,700
in the same way you have this Kundalini within.

540
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,200
Seed has its blooms.

541
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,400
And it works.

542
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,560
It has worked for thousands

543
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,800
and it should work for you also.

544
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,000
But these are special times.

545
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,100
I call it a blossom time.

546
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,100
But this is the last judgment.

547
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,280
It´s nonsense to say that when you will die

548
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,820
and then you will come and you will be judged.

549
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What your bones would be there?

550
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,500
Just discussions, discussions, discussions.

551
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,900
Just empty words.

552
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:26,100
So, this spontaneous happening has to work out within you.

553
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,200
If it works out,

554
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,400
then you have to see that the connection is established.

555
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:50,500
For this living process, you cant´t pay, you cant´t pay!

556
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,300
How much do we pay to mother earth, when she gives us flowers?

557
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,500
It is all built in within you. It is built in.

558
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,900
And it will work out, I am sure, tonight.

559
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,100
I know some of you have some questions. I can see.

560
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,800
I´ll become quite an expert in answering all kinds of questions.

561
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,900
But that´s a mental acrobats. Why do you want to?

562
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,200
Why don´t have your realization?

563
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,900
See in this beautiful hall, we have these lights.

564
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,460
And if you want to put the light, you will say alright,

565
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:05,000
there is a switch, you press it and all the lights will come.

566
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,500
Because it is all built in!

567
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,120
First supposing I have to tell you

568
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,400
the history of electricity and then how it came here,

569
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,900
where is [UNCLEAR], where is hole, you will be [UNCLEAR bored of].

570
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,940
I don´t know in English language,

571
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,400
must have given at-least 4 to 5 thousands lectures.

572
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,300
Apart from other, other languages.

573
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,000
So far, I have not written any book as such.

574
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:57,500
Because again they would say, Mother say so. You see another....

575
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:11,400
So, best is for your-self, you get your realization.

576
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,400
And if you have any questions, you can write them down

577
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,040
and let us know, we´ll answer them in [UNCLEAR].

578
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,580
Seeker asks: What is the practice about?

579
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,920
That´s what I am going to do, you are the seeker, I was [UNCLEAR]!

580
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,380
That´s it!

581
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:41,660
That´s what and then what you preach you can practice.

582
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,500
That´s happen. Very good. Such a intelligent!

583
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,860
He told me that you are some clear seekers. He told me so.

584
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,000
I was very happy.

585
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:14,880
As it is, I have told you that if you asked for it,

586
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,500
it´s your own, you will get it.

587
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,200
But I cannot force it on you.

588
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,300
I respect your freedom.

589
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:39,900
Because ultimately, you have to have complete freedom.

590
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,160
You´ll be amazed, over night people have dropped their drugs.

591
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:51,500
Alcoholism. Over night!

592
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,500
In the place like London.

593
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,900
Which is a difficult place.

594
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,700
But now they are very different.

595
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,500
You have got some of them in here now.

596
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,800
They have come from England also to help me.

597
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:24,700
Alright, this is a very nice encouraging  question. Alright,

598
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,320
so now are you all prepared to take your realization or not?

599
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,100
Those who do not want to have, should leave the hall.

600
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,000
If you want to have your realization,

601
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:51,100
you should know that it´s a very simple thing to do.

602
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,660
But if you are complicated

603
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,200
then it takes time. But ultimately you get it.

604
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:18,900
So, those who do not want, should leave the hall. Please, thank you.

605
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:28,180
And you will have to do whatever I tell you because its not sitting

606
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:33,800
to watch other people aaa like aaa…  .

607
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,300
When they are meditating, they are going to work it out.

608
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,700
I would request you to cooperate with everyone.

609
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,800
But if you don´t want it, you can leave the hall.

610
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,800
But please don´t disturb others by looking at others.

611
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,500
Now whatever I will be suggesting,

612
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,620
whatever I will be suggesting now,

613
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,920
whatever I will be now... you need not...,

614
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,900
you need not do it.

615
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,000
So what is it?

616
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:59,220
Of course, but we get over karmas. Very good question.

617
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,560
Karmas are there.

618
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,000
Only human beings have karmas because of their ego.

619
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,700
Animals don´t think that they are doing anything wrong,

620
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,840
in anything whatever, because they are bound.

621
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:49,400
And it is only the human beings because

622
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,140
they think they are doing something,

623
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,400
that´s why, because of the ego. I am doing.

624
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,280
But after realization you don´t say I am doing something.

625
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,420
You just say it is not going, it is not..,

626
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,600
in third person you start talking.

627
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:26,160
You just say it is going, it is working, it is happening.

628
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:31,000
You don´t say I am doing, I. I disappears.

629
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,600
I have already told you that Christ sucks in all our karmas.

630
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,700
What is the second (question)?

631
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,500
Diet is that there is nothing isms’ since Sahaja Yoga.

632
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:19,140
Of course, one should not eat animals which are bigger than them

633
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,600
like horses or mules or something.

634
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:32,200
Because they spoil the teeth. Their muscles spoil the teeth.

635
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,660
Those who need more protein should have more proteins,

636
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,300
those who need more carbohydrates

637
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,600
should have more carbohydrates.

638
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,920
What is the use of saving the chickens.

639
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,700
I can’t give them realization, can I?

640
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,620
It´s as simple as that.

641
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
Alright.

642
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,600
This is another fad.

643
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,100
Vegetarianism , another fad.

644
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,500
It may suit in the west because they have bad livers.

645
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,760
And they have taken too much of food, I think.

646
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,640
They have taken to much of this meets and thing so...to much of...

647
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,800
Animals!

648
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,500
So, you have to understand later on

649
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:02,100
what you have to eat. That´s all.

650
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,400
And they will give you full idea about.

651
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,940
Lastly, before we start, I have to tell you one thing

652
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:20,500
that Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

653
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,540
Today you will get your realization

654
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,900
and you will feel on top of the earth... world.

655
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,600
But, you have to come to collective.

656
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,580
So that in totality, in totality

657
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,960
you understand Sahaja Yoga,

658
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,320
you master it

659
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,880
and that you all the time

660
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,700
remain in the realm of Kingdom of God.

661
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,440
It doesn´t take any much time.

662
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,900
Sometimes I have seen in 8 days people have become masters.

663
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,020
But

664
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,060
you have to be collective

665
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:33,200
because you must master it.

666
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:43,200
You are the people who have to help your countrymen.

667
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,300
And later on the whole world.

668
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,700
John in his revelation has said only 44 000 will be realized souls.

669
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:18,300
I think, he was...it must be something symbolic, he must have said.

670
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,600
But we have many more than that.

671
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:30,000
And we have to hope to have many more also.

672
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:36,000
There are seekers and seekers.

673
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,960
So another, one simple request, if you don´t mind very much

674
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,220
because in the beginning English felt very bad

675
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,300
when I told them to take out their shoes.

676
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,060
Because this feet when they touch the ground,

677
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,000
the  Mother earth sucks in all the problems.

678
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,300
As I told you there is left and right side there,

679
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,400
left and right side.

680
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,320
And the left side is the power of ordinary desire.

681
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:45,600
And the right side is the power of action.

682
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,080
So, today only we have to do it, never again.

683
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,500
Is to nourish our own centers ourselves.

684
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,300
Some things are so short when you translate

685
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:13,340
which are bigger, you [UNCLEAR] interesting.

686
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,580
Alright [UNCLEAR].

687
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,640
Alright, now these, put your left hand,

688
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:26,200
you have to be very comfortable first of all. Be comfortable.

689
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,920
You don´t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your heads,

690
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,000
nothing of the kind. Be very comfortable.

691
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,720
Now the left hand is to be put properly like this.

692
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,900
Good.

693
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,900
Alright, now.

694
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,240
So, this is symbolic that you are desirous

695
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,200
of having your self-realization, is symbolic.

696
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:18,800
And the right hand is to be used for nourishing your centers.

697
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:27,900
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

698
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,400
If you are wearing a coat, it´s better to put inside.

699
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,000
It´s alright. On the heart, lower , little lower is the heart.

700
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,700
In the heart resides the spirit

701
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:50,800
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

702
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,240
Now,

703
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,200
then,

704
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,960
if you become the spirit,

705
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:04,380
in the light of a spirit you become your own guide.

706
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,100
You become your own master.

707
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,380
So, please take your right hand

708
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,040
in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

709
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,800
We are working only on the left hand side.

710
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,200
Now.

711
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,200
This is the center of your mastery,

712
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:39,900
created by all the great prophets.

713
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:53,620
Now. Take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen

714
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,700
on the left hand side.

715
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,500
Push with your fingers. Push with your fingers.

716
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,600
This is the center

717
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:12,100
of pure divine knowledge.

718
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,200
You will be amazed that it´s placed here.

719
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,300
Later on you know everything.

720
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:33,400
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

721
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:45,600
Now place it on top of your heart again.

722
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,580
Now

723
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:52,760
when we feel guilty,

724
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:57,600
we create a very big problem for ourselves.

725
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,600
If you might commit any mistake,

726
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,200
you should face it and  finish it off.

727
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,240
But when you feel guilty the center here on the left side

728
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,000
gets completely blocked.

729
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,860
And you get diseases like angina

730
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:33,800
and...  What you call? Spondylitis or lethargic organs.

731
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,180
So please put your right hand

732
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,500
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

733
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,100
and turn your head to your right.

734
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,600
Now.

735
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,540
No use feel guilty now, as I told you.

736
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,740
Moreover you are human beings and

737
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,300
only human beings can make mistakes, you are not Gods.

738
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,980
So.

739
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:28,400
Then you have to know that you have to forgive everyone in general.

740
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,920
For that you have to put your right hand on top of your forehead

741
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,100
and put down the head.

742
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,700
Forehead across.

743
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,700
Logically, whether you forgive or don´t forgive,

744
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:56,000
you don´t do anything.

745
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,200
But if you don´t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

746
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,640
And those who have troubled you

747
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:17,100
are having a nice time.

748
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,400
Moreover this center is very constricted.

749
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,360
And if you do not forgive, it will never open

750
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:31,800
and you miss your self-realization.

751
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,580
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head

752
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:49,900
and push back your head as far as possible.

753
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,220
In this center without feeling guilty,

754
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,140
without  counting your mistakes,

755
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,400
just for your satisfaction,

756
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:09,000
you have to ask forgiveness from the all Divine Power.

757
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,760
This is the Agnya chakra where Christ resides

758
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:25,980
and in the Lord´s Prayer, he has said, "Forgive us our trespasses

759
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:31,100
as we forgive them, those who trespass against us."

760
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,840
Now stretch your palms fully.

761
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:49,000
This is the last center.

762
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,860
And put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area

763
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:02,600
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

764
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,600
Now you please put down your head.

765
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:20,500
And this time push back your fingers as far as possible

766
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:23,640
and have a good pressure on your scalp

767
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:28,800
and move it 7 times clock wise.

768
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,800
That´s it. That´s all we have to do. Now we have to close our eyes.

769
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,800
Before that I will tell you, there are three conditions.

770
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,400
Conditions.

771
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,440
The first is that you should be all very confident

772
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,300
that you will all get your realization.

773
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,860
That means, do not feel guilty,

774
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,860
do not think you have done bad karmas , nothing of the kind.

775
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:23,700
Forget it. At this moment you are absolutely alright.

776
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,700
In short you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

777
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,500
Now the second condition is,

778
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,500
the third now, because the first is that you should be confident,

779
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:56,480
second thing you should not feel guilty and the third one is

780
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:01,200
that you have to forgive everyone.

781
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:09,400
Don´t even have to think about it.

782
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,700
Because it´s a headache.

783
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,180
You have to just in general, you have to say later on

784
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,700
when I tell you just to forgive everyone.

785
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,360
Now you will have to put left hand like this

786
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,820
with both of the  feet  apart from each other

787
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,900
and put your right hand on your heart.

788
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,720
Now if you are wearing glasses, you can take them out

789
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,660
because now you have to close your eyes,

790
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,460
till I tell you, don´t open them, please.

791
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,200
So.

792
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,300
Please close your eyes.

793
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:24,160
Now, here

794
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:31,100
you have to ask me a fundamental question about yourself.

795
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,300
You can call me mother or Shri Mataji.

796
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,780
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

797
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,100
Ask this question three times.

798
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:12,100
So if you are the spirit, you become your own master.

799
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,540
So, please take your right hand

800
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,400
in the upper portion of your abdomen on left hand side.

801
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,800
Here ask another fundamental question.

802
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,320
Three times in your heart.

803
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:41,700
Mother, am I my own master?

804
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,040
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

805
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:01,040
and I cannot force divine pure knowledge on you.

806
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,300
You have to ask for it.

807
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
So now please take your right hand

808
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,300
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

809
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,400
and press it hard.

810
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:30,600
You have to ask 6 times, because this center has got 6 petals.

811
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:43,500
You should say,  "Mother please, give me pure divine knowledge."

812
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:52,200
This divine knowledge works through your nerves,

813
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,400
through your nervous system.

814
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,140
Now,

815
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,020
as soon as you ask for divine knowledge,

816
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,800
the Kundalini starts rising.

817
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:23,800
Now raise your right hand

818
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,180
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

819
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:29,300
and press it hard.

820
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:40,940
Here you have to say with full confidence,

821
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:46,460
to open this center, you have to say with full confidence 10 times,

822
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:52,300
"Mother, I am my own master."

823
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:14,820
I have to tell you that actually you are not this body,

824
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,780
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

825
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:24,400
but you are the pure spirit.

826
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,380
So now raise your right hand on your heart

827
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:45,220
and say with full self-confidence, "Mother I am the pure spirit."

828
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:51,600
Please say this 12 times.

829
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,540
This all pervading divine power

830
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:16,200
is the ocean of knowledge compassion and bliss.

831
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,440
But above all it is

832
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:32,900
the ocean of forgiveness.

833
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:41,300
And whatever mistakes you might commit,

834
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:50,900
this power of this ocean of forgiveness can dissolve it.

835
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,200
So, have faith in yourself.

836
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,560
And forgive yourself.

837
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,840
Now put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

838
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:14,500
and turn your head to your right.

839
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,640
Now here without feeling guilty,

840
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:28,020
without counting your mistakes.

841
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:31,200
You have to say 16 times,

842
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:36,900
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

843
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:09,500
I have already told you that logically,

844
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:14,600
if you forgive or don´t forgive, you don´t do anything.

845
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,800
But if you don´t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

846
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:34,200
Moreover this center is Agya center, is very constricted

847
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,020
and if you don´t forgive Kundalini will never rise

848
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:40,800
and you will miss your self realization.

849
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,140
So forgive everyone in general.

850
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:55,500
Don´t think about them.

851
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,980
Please put your right hand on your forehead across

852
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,400
and put down your head.

853
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:17,380
Here you have to say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

854
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:22,100
Say it from your heart. Not how many times.

855
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:51,560
Now take back your hand on the back side

856
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,700
of your head.

857
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:03,400
Here you have to say without counting your mistakes,

858
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,240
without feeling guilty, for your own satisfaction,

859
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:12,260
"Oh Divine power, if I have done any mistake please forgive me."

860
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,400
Please say it from your heart, not how many times.

861
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:25,000
Please push back your head little bit.

862
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:31,100
Push back towards the sky.

863
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,800
Push back.

864
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,100
Now the last center.

865
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:49,740
You have to stretch your palm fully,

866
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:53,520
stretch the palm fully and

867
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:58,580
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

868
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:04,300
Stretch back your fingers and put down your head.

869
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,980
Here again I can not force self-realization on you.

870
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:25,800
You have to humbly ask for it.

871
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,940
Please put down your head and ask 7 times,

872
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,320
"Mother, please give me self-realization."

873
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:45,400
and move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

874
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:42,100
Now please take down your hands.

875
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,800
Put both hands towards me, like this.

876
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:54,400
And watch me without thinking.

877
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:02,400
You achieve a state called as thoughtless awareness.

878
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,280
Where you can stop your thinking and if you want to think,

879
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,400
you can think.

880
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,200
Now watch me without thinking.

881
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,820
Please put your right hand towards me

882
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:34,220
and put down your head. And see with the left hand,

883
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,980
if there is a cool or a hot breeze like waves

884
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:42,300
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

885
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,860
You should not  put your hand on top, but

886
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,400
it should be above your head.

887
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,700
Some people get it faraway.

888
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,300
If is it hot that means you have not forgiven.

889
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,400
Now please put left hand towards me.

890
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,100
Bend your head and see with your right  hand,

891
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:30,220
if you can feel cool or hot breeze like  waves

892
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:35,000
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

893
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:49,400
Now take your right hand towards me, please put your right hand.

894
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,640
Bend your head and see for yourself again with the left hand,

895
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,060
if there is cool breeze like or

896
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:04,000
hot one coming out of your head for the last time.

897
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,100
Now please put both your hands

898
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:20,040
towards the sky and head towards the sky

899
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:25,000
and ask anyone of these three questions three times.

900
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:35,560
The first question you can ask three times,

901
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:41,700
"Mother, is this  the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

902
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,240
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the

903
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:56,400
Divine power of God´s love?"

904
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:03,360
Or else you can ask three times

905
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:07,100
"Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?"

906
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,300
Now please bring both your hands towards me like this.

907
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,680
You will feel very relaxed. You can put on your glasses

908
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:31,000
You feel very relaxed.

909
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:38,540
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze

910
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,820
on their finger tips or on their palms

911
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,300
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

912
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,900
That´s really Finland. May God bless you.

913
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,400
Your saintly life has started.

914
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,900
Please care for it.

915
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:23,200
Respect it.

916
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:28,300
You don´t have to pay for anything whatsoever.

917
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:36,200
Love yourself. Respect yourself.

918
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,280
May God bless you.

919
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:44,540
May God bless you.

920
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:50,740
May God bless you. Some people have suddenly changed, you know.

921
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:56,300
So be careful. It´s not mental. It is beyond mind.

922
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,500
You don´t argue. If you start arguing, it will come down.

923
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,400
Your attention has gone beyond mind.

924
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:20,100
This is the actualization of baptism.

925
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,800
Now you can baptize many people.

926
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,000
Only think humbly, you have to learn this.

927
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,600
We have a very good leader in Finland.

928
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:47,300
And you are welcome to know everything about it.

929
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:53,100
And those who [UNCLEAR have to work] also shouldn´t worry.

930
01:43:53,920 --> 01:44:00,300
I don´t mind meeting them, also is time, I can meet them.

931
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:12,800
Anyone who wants to meet me,

932
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:20,600
come along, all of you.

933
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:28,100
You are all welcome.
