1
00:00:06,568 --> 00:00:11,691
It’s so gratifying and joyous to see all
of you here,

2
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:19,915
today, assembled to do Shri Krishna Puja.

3
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:23,831
Can you hear Me there?

4
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:30,410
No? Can’t hear.

5
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:36,549
Gregoire: Phil, can you connect back…

6
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:11,948
Shri Mataji: To see so many Sahaja Yogis
assembled here,

7
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:17,235
I’m sure the devil must have run away
long time back.

8
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:28,007
And the caravan must have left

9
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:35,053
but I hope we are aware of it

10
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:41,855
and we forget about our fears of our
catches, of our past,

11
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:46,671
of all the nonsense we have done so far.

12
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:57,083
Suddenly in My presence, I think, people
get into a sense of guilt.

13
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:02,248
I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you,

14
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:09,424
to make you beautiful and not to feel
guilty.

15
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:24,717
Actually, when we start looking
at ourselves,

16
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:30,663
the first thing we notice is that there’s
a block on the Agnya,

17
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:37,196
but this block in the Agnya is the worst
thing that can happen to us

18
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,694
because it is the door of the Kundalini.

19
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,991
She reaches up to Vishuddhi, all right,

20
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:49,209
and when She has to move forward,
this Agnya stops it.

21
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:55,095
That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have
all the Vishuddhi problems.

22
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:59,413
The flow cannot take place.

23
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:08,050
Also, this is one of the reasons we feel
guilty - because of left Vishuddhi.

24
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,906
It’s a symptom of a disease.

25
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:16,655
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

26
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:20,863
So we have to understand, first of all,
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

27
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:24,426
We are not ordinary people

28
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,158
or we are not people who have not known
the truth;

29
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,147
we have known the truth. We have to be
completely aware of it.

30
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:39,450
That’s one truth if you establish, you have
established yourself quite a lot.

31
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,090
Now the ordinary people as you have seen
on Oxford St., you see,

32
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,080
they wear dress - Indian dresses funnily
tied;

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,809
they don’t know how to tie it up, dhotis
and saris, and they shake their heads

34
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:03,006
and buy some of these, what we call them,

35
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:08,386
shindis or bodhis or I don’t know what you
call, tails, pigtails,

36
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:17,564
and attach them with some glue and they
start dancing.

37
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:24,628
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,

38
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:33,877
and the saris and the dhotis, everything
start opening out.

39
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,783
That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene,
I tell you.

40
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:40,815
One side you see the punks and another
side you see this nonsense,

41
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,993
in the name of Shri Krishna, that’s even
worse.

42
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,229
Punks do not do it in the name of,

43
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:49,943
I don’t know if they do it in the name
of King Solomon.

44
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:56,529
But they do it in somebody’s name, these
people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

45
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,597
On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are
described in all the books

46
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:23,017
and in all the poetry that poets could
sing about.

47
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:26,734
He was never shaven-headed. It is
impossible

48
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:31,885
to understand how these people got the idea
that you must shave your head.

49
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:38,865
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara
has been so misunderstood.

50
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:44,844
It’s absolutely misunderstood because
we cannot understand

51
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:51,277
that the truth is covered with maya,
always.

52
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,498
And you should keep maya on one side
and go to the truth.

53
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,554
Instead of that, we get lost in the maya,
like very simple example, as it is,

54
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:03,960
that He is a Yogeshwara; so these people
have idea of a yogi,

55
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,845
that he should be shaven, he should wear
that dhoti, dirty one,

56
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:14,857
and must put on a pigtail. Another concept,
maya is a concept.

57
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,230
And when you start living on those concepts
of your own,

58
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:21,763
you may gather it up with something else,
you may think that Christ

59
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:27,085
was a person who was a sannyasi, who used
to wear another kind of a robe

60
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:30,798
and He had a beard and He had hair like
this. All those ideas,

61
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:36,812
“So if we become like this, we’ll be very
great yogis.”

62
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,824
These are all our concepts about someone

63
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:46,068
whom we have never seen, whom we have
never known.

64
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:51,750
And because we live in those concepts,
we get limited.

65
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,703
It’s very difficult for these people
to break through

66
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:04,214
because maya can only be broken through
Rrealization.

67
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,796
That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga
is Realization.

68
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:07,774
Get your Realization.

69
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:10,076
You are a drunkard, all right, get your
Realization.

70
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,895
You are a drug addict, get your
Realization.

71
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,993
You are a bad man, get your Realization.

72
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:20,089
Anyone, get your Realization first;
put the light first into a person.

73
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,294
Let him see for himself.

74
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:29,046
So all this identification with different
concepts

75
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:38,590
is responsible for giving us a very mayavi
or illusive personality.

76
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,294
We live in an illusive personality, live
with it,

77
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:48,927
enjoy it and we think we are perfectly
all right.

78
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:57,015
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis

79
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:02,235
and you have come here for Shri Krishna
Puja,

80
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,415
what is the preparation we have to do?

81
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:10,082
We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about
Kundalini,

82
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:16,102
we know about Vishuddhis, we know about
Shri Krishna.

83
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:24,082
All right, how are we going to prepare
ourselves for the puja of Shri Krishna?

84
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:33,459
First of all, He tried to break all
the concepts.

85
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:48,837
First the concept He broke was that you
have to be like a ascetic to look at.

86
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:54,233
He broke this concept; He lived like
a king.

87
00:08:56,658 --> 00:09:04,178
In His childhood He used to go and play
with the cows.

88
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:16,158
And there He would use a peacock’s feather
to decorate Himself,

89
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:30,945
and He would listen to beautiful music
of the river Yamuna and reproduce it.

90
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:39,410
He was Leeladhara, He was the one who
created all kinds of mirth.

91
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,464
What is mirth in French?

92
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,536
They don’t have mirth, I believe.
Gregoire: I don’t understand, Shri Mataji…

93
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,875
Yogis: Mirth.

94
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:53,534
Gregoire: Mirth… they don’t.

95
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,929
Shri Mataji: Eh? No?

96
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,812
Yogi: Fun.
Gregoire: No, it’s not fun… Sweetness.

97
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,730
Shri Mataji: It’s not fun, it’s more than…,
it’s mirth.

98
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,538
Mirth is sweeter than fun.
Gregoire: Sweet fun…

99
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:15,026
Shri Mataji: All right, sweet fun.
What a word!

100
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,405
Sweet fun!

101
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,612
This is mirth, now what is happening
to you is mirth.

102
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:36,351
I’m creating mirth in which you feel
tickled, you know.

103
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:41,476
Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

104
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:51,003
So, He tried to create mirth, never
seriousness

105
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:57,099
but He was not frivolous. He was Yogeshwara
Himself. He was not frivolous.

106
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:04,658
So this difference between frivolity
and mirth

107
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:12,285
is to be understood only through Him
because He’s also discretion.

108
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:26,253
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is
destructive. Anything frivolous if you do…

109
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:30,995
[Please close it, isn’t it? There’s
something problematic.]

110
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:48,558
So, we have to be in a state of mirth,

111
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:57,876
so no question of feeling guilty comes in,
we are not prisoners, are we?

112
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:02,103
We are prisoners of our own concepts
and our own ideas

113
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,578
and our own degradation.

114
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:11,086
We degrade ourselves, God does not.

115
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:19,657
So we should be in the state of complete
mirth and enjoyment.

116
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:28,183
Now it has rained, all right.

117
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:32,743
That’s a very good thing to happen today.

118
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:36,890
Yesterday I was listening to the program,
I was just smiling,

119
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,465
because I knew it would not work out
that way.

120
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:45,317
Gregoire: Everybody knew, Shri Mataji…

121
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:55,680
Shri Mataji: And in India, on this day,
when they celebrate, in the morning,

122
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:06,901
children of the village or children
of the particular areas gather together.

123
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:19,346
And for them the house-holders tie up
a little pitcher, which we call as a matka,

124
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:24,537
and in that there is money, anything
valuable they want to give to the children,

125
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:31,352
sweets, everything put inside that, and
is tied up in the air.

126
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:35,017
Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain

127
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:39,149
then they pour water on the children
to make them feel it’s raining.

128
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,656
Rain is very much connected with
Shri Krishna.

129
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,718
So the children come and they go in a way
that

130
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:59,058
the taller boys are first, then smaller,
then smaller like a pyramid they go up

131
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,604
till at the end there’s one boy who’s sort
of representing Shri Krishna

132
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,491
and then he breaks that. And from there
everything falls down

133
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:14,147
and flowers, everything on them, they take
the money,

134
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:20,262
they take all those things and start
enjoying.

135
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:26,327
Then they go to another place, the whole
day they are moving in the city like that

136
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:35,054
and every good householder ties that matka

137
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:41,254
for these children, for them to come
and enjoy themselves.

138
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:50,541
That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna
Ashtami in Gokul where He lived as a child.

139
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:57,691
Now why is He so much connected with rain?

140
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:10,045
Once all His friends and He were looking
after the cows

141
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:20,171
and Indra felt that He is very powerful,
somehow, I don’t know,

142
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:24,592
He gets into jealousies sometimes.

143
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:36,165
And He sent rain to test His patience,

144
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:41,626
His leela, His play, His mirth.

145
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:54,413
And it rained and rained and rained and
they did not know what to do.

146
00:15:55,151 --> 00:16:00,554
So there was a mountain called Govardhan.

147
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:06,984
Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick
or His finger

148
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:12,056
and just put it up on top of His finger,
like that.

149
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,916
That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

150
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:20,525
And the whole mountain was on top

151
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:26,771
and all the children joined Him and
all the cows

152
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:34,501
and He asked the children, “You also put
your sticks up to help Me.”

153
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:43,444
And they all put their sticks and standing
very sweetly holding the Govardhan.

154
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:50,469
That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

155
00:16:54,451 --> 00:17:00,924
So the rain had to come and the cows
with their bells have to remind us.

156
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:05,089
And imagine the lake has a name which
is a black;

157
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,642
Krishna means black, Krishna word itself
means black.

158
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,745
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out!

159
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:23,983
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj
but are so planned?

160
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:32,233
And here we are sitting, it’s raining,
nicely enjoying everything.

161
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:46,590
But on the contrary, when we start not
enjoying,

162
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:54,211
we play into, either into our ego
or superego.

163
00:17:56,015 --> 00:18:03,225
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people,

164
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,192
then we start making others like ourselves.

165
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:19,002
We like to make them suffer and torture
them.

166
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:23,346
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is
leprosy.”

167
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:29,226
Anybody who is in poverty can develop
horrible things within themselves.

168
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:32,245
It is never to be sided with, not to be
sympathized

169
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,470
but to be completely eradicated.

170
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,680
Another side is the ego where we try
to dominate others and enjoy that.

171
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:50,147
There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating
others and saying things to others.

172
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:55,182
I was sorry to hear yesterday that there
are some girls who are married,

173
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,422
some Indian girls who are married

174
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:01,589
and their husbands are not respecting them
and troubling them.

175
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,666
It hurt Me very much.

176
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:08,004
That shows they’re so low-level people,
very low level.

177
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:11,935
Such a mediocracy, such useless people.

178
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:17,846
They should have never come to Sahaja
Yoga and deceived us like this.

179
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:23,883
They will go to hell direct; I can tell you
this (much).

180
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:30,941
Now there are some who are caught up
with their superego;

181
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:37,439
they suffer from some sort of a funny
Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia.

182
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:42,384
And they don’t want to get rid of it.

183
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:50,450
They just don’t want to understand that
they’re not normal people,

184
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,453
they have to be perfectly all right.

185
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:01,122
They make everyone miserable,

186
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,474
jump on to all the places where they should
not be.

187
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:11,375
Like a person who has got, say, example,
tuberculosis, a disease which is contagious.

188
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:14,433
Must understand he has got tuberculosis,
keep out,

189
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:18,451
don’t give it to others, at least.

190
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:26,013
But those who have got badhas will
definitely come,

191
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,628
either they’ll give big lectures.

192
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:34,882
I start seeing them like big bhoots
speaking,

193
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:42,422
or if not - they have badhas then they will
come at a place where they should not be.

194
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:46,592
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,

195
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:53,228
all kinds of things they’ll be doing,
catching people.

196
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:57,149
And they enjoy it because they are
identified with the badhas.

197
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,108
How will they improve?

198
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:13,019
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish
fellow, we have had him for, I think,

199
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:21,037
at least for a century I should say, and
he’s giving lectures to others,

200
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:28,322
You must clean the shoes of all the Sahaja
Yogis to get rid of your ego.

201
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:37,009
So such a gross, depraved and low-level
people are still in Sahaja Yoga.

202
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,938
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes
less.

203
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:49,469
If you eat rice with stones in it, how
will you enjoy it?

204
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:54,984
And that’s what it is.

205
00:21:56,267 --> 00:22:02,361
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,

206
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:08,828
to have the mirth but still we are living

207
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:15,073
with all joy-killing things that we have.

208
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:22,842
How are we going to get rid of those
things?

209
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:29,820
So, at least we do not become thorns
in the lives of others.

210
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:36,026
So the so-called free will, I’m happy
Rustom has told you about it,

211
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:43,401
is nothing but your ego and superego
because you’re not in the center.

212
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:53,581
In the center, you have nothing but
freedom, that’s all, nothing but freedom;

213
00:22:53,781 --> 00:23:01,413
nothing like free will, freedom, complete
freedom.

214
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:07,022
There’s nothing like will or nothing like
bhoots,

215
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:17,529
nothing like bondage, it’s entire avenue
of freedom.

216
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:30,121
Then this freedom is the knowledge,

217
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:39,180
this freedom is the love, this freedom
is the discretion.

218
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,042
Then you say God gives you freedom and
others freedom equally;

219
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:56,331
then you act which doesn’t bound you
nor anybody else

220
00:23:56,532 --> 00:24:01,976
because it is knowledge, it is discretion.

221
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,453
Age does not matter, what age you are.
I’ve seen some also very old people

222
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:20,889
singing beautifully and enjoying Sahaja
Yoga and make Me enjoy also.

223
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:27,270
Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else.

224
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,880
But because we’re not free people,
we cannot enjoy.

225
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:48,037
There is no bondage of any evil thought
which keeps you down.

226
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:57,243
It is so subtle but penetrating into every
that is gross,

227
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:03,939
that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful flute

228
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:11,997
which creates a picture of the nature.

229
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:14,444
The description (Sanskrit words),

230
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:21,456
the whole thing becomes silent like
a picture.

231
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:33,051
So, this evening we’ll have the puja,
we’ll have all the enjoyment

232
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,777
of Shri Krishna’s blessings upon us.

233
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:45,650
There’s no end to the stories of Shri
Krishna, all full of mirth and play

234
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,421
and innocence that kills rakshasas, devils.

235
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:58,358
So today I’ve talked to you about His
childhood,

236
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:04,131
and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

237
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:07,494
May God bless you.

238
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:11,988
Some water.

239
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:21,225
Gregoire: Would You like a cup of tea,
Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Water.

240
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:27,408
Gregoire: Tea is ready… water…
Shri Mataji: Please, I’ll have some water.

241
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:47,302
You all are catching from Vishuddhi, I must
say, very badly.

242
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:52,385
And I’m full of it, here. All My vibrations
are just flowing from here.

243
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:58,710
So I would say that you all should say
“Allah Hu Akbar” sixteen times just now.

244
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:04,038
Gregoire: We get up? (To yogis) Get up.

245
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:08,844
[Yogis say “Allah Hu Akbar” 16 times]

246
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:18,607
Shri Mataji: Feeling better now?

247
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,541
If you go out, keep your Vishuddhis
covered,

248
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:28,357
but I don’t think anybody should go out
today -

249
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:32,767
in a way is good, for the puja - after
the puja tomorrow.

250
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:35,327
Then watch your Vishuddhis to be alright
today,

251
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:40,112
that’s why it has rained, I hope you
don’t mind.

252
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:43,784
Gregoire: Please sit down, everybody.

253
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:51,993
Shri Mataji: Ah, you wanted to have some
bhajans, something?

254
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:54,406
Gregoire: Would You like some bhajans now?
Shri Mataji: Could have it…

255
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:57,735
Gregoire: Good idea. (To yogis:) Can we
have some bhajans?

256
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,762
One or two first songs? “We are the world”,
okay.

257
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:05,529
Warren: As well as of saying “God is great”,
can we say “Mataji is great”, somehow?

258
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,659
Somehow is there some way by which we could
say that? Because still it’s catching.

259
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,102
Gregoire: Let’s have “We are the world”.
Eh? Shri Mataji: All right.

260
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:13,723
Gregoire: Ah? What is it?
Shri Mataji: When we say…

261
00:29:13,924 --> 00:29:16,753
Warren: Mother, can we say “Shri Mataji”
is great? Again…

262
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:21,012
Shri Mataji: Might be. Might be. Think it
now, what they say?

263
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:28,799
Gregoire: Fantastic. Okay. We are going
to sing “We are the world”…

264
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,080
…There are people seeking /

265
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:39,212
And it's time to lend a hand to life /

266
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:43,910
The greatest gift of all /

267
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:52,495
They can't go on pretending day by day /

268
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:59,670
That someone, somewhere will soon
make a change /

269
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:07,724
We are all a part of God's great family

270
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:14,884
And the truth, you know /
Love is all we need /

271
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:22,449
We are the world, we are the children /

272
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:29,915
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

273
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:38,037
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

274
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:45,291
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

275
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:53,234
Send them your heart so they'll know
that someone cares /

276
00:30:53,435 --> 00:31:00,256
And their lives will be stronger and free /

277
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:08,231
Our Mother gave us the Spirit
and its joy /

278
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:15,339
So we all must lend a helping hand /

279
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:22,495
We are the world, we are the children /

280
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:30,171
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

281
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:38,116
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

282
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:45,473
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

283
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:52,603
When you're down and out, there seems
no hope at all /

284
00:31:52,803 --> 00:32:00,275
But if you just believe, there's no way
we can fall /

285
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:07,766
All let's realize that a change can
only come /

286
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:14,645
When we stand together as one /

287
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:21,876
We are the world, we are the children /

288
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:29,352
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

289
00:32:29,553 --> 00:32:37,241
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

290
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:43,986
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

291
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:51,583
You are the world / You are the Mother /

292
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:59,058
You are the One who makes a brighter day /
So let’s absorb it /

293
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:07,157
In our hearts we meet You /
the greatest joy of all /

294
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:14,201
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

295
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:21,693
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

296
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:36,511
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

297
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:46,929
Gregoire: It’s not necessary to applaud
at ourselves!

298
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:53,994
Shri Mataji: I was just waiting for Me
to clap, but ... everybody applauded.

299
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:58,363
It’s good, you see, a very good song.

300
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:00,792
But I think little change would be needed,

301
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:04,409
to be good from vibrations point of view.
All right?

302
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:10,653
Now. Let’s have another one.
Gregoire: Can we have the Italian one?

303
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:25,308
What is it? Wait one minute, because we
are going to distribute the copies…

304
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:29,261
to distribute the copies.

305
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:37,769
Shri Mataji, the story of this song,
the music of this song

306
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,877
is that there was this big musical which
was organized

307
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:43,050
to raise money for Africa.

308
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,119
And they took the music and they changed
the words.

309
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:55,770
It’s a song which is coming from America.
And… one day….

310
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:46,230
Shri Mataji (to the children): See how she’s
sitting? You sit all of you like that.

311
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:51,995
Melania’s sitting properly, like a yogi.

312
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:27,765
It’s written in English or in… It’s done
in English or in Italian?

313
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:32,712
Yogis: In English.
Shri Mataji: Oh, good.

314
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:42,373
How many of you know Italian?

315
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,403
I’m going to join!

316
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,817
Alright. That’s all.

317
00:36:55,029 --> 00:37:01,122
That’s one of the nearest language,
I think, one can learn very easily.

318
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:15,813
 But you must learn English
first!

319
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,234
And the Spanish is another language
one can learn easily,

320
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:31,950
if the Spanish learn the English.

321
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:45,599
Or Hindi, one of the languages that I know.

322
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:04,485
I also know American English, you know?

323
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:20,186
Vishuddhi’s very much cleared out, can
you see that? Very good.

324
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:23,564
Gregoire: We worked on the United States
by singing this, Shri Mataji.

325
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:31,632
Shri Mataji: Yes. Good. I’m going there.
Alright, start it now.

326
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,165
Antonio is going to start…

327
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:45,425
Gregoire: It’s coming.
Shri Mataji: Coming.

328
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:23,322
Shri Mataji: Beautiful song, eh?
What a nice song. Beautiful.

329
00:42:36,176 --> 00:42:39,380
Wonderful…

330
00:42:39,675 --> 00:42:48,131
It’s a real fast (…), I must say.
Beautiful. Very nice.

331
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:54,490
Gregoire: Which one next?
Yogi: Germany.

332
00:42:56,436 --> 00:42:59,210
Yogi: Belgium.
Yogi: Belgium.

333
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:04,646
Yogi: We have a German song all in English.
Gregoire: What else?

334
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:12,313
Yogi: French song in English, Swiss song
in English…

335
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,999
Gregoire: Whatever you desire, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Anything,

336
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,504
I’m alright for everything…

337
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,389
Yogi: The English, in English.

338
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,192
Yogi: We can start with the English
in English!

339
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,743
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

340
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:39,546
It’s for English in English!

341
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:52,012
Yogi: Does everybody have one page?
Yogis: No, no.

342
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:55,928
Gregoire: It’s one song to Lord Krishna.

343
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:22,529
Shri Mataji: Great, wonderful!

344
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:29,439
Nice power is shown! May God bless you
all for this.

345
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:36,303
Now, who else? Another?

346
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:40,411
French, of course!

347
00:48:42,792 --> 00:48:45,750
Beautiful.

348
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:49,991
That’s very nice song, I should say,

349
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:55,025
like a marching song, is good idea.

350
00:49:11,772 --> 00:49:15,152
Yogi: The French song.

351
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:40,450
Yogi: The French song.

352
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:48,347
Shri Mataji: Very good one! For the French
to sing this I’m very happy.

353
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:55,934
You won’t believe! “Les miserables”,
you see, people with the background.

354
00:49:56,135 --> 00:50:04,487
It’s a great, eh? To see you all smiling
like that! It’s great!

355
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,720
Imagine, what a transformation.

356
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,686
Real transformation, I'll say.

357
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:24,354
[The French song is about “the Joy
of the Kingdom of God”]

358
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:42,700
Shri Mataji: That’s a good preparation
for the Krishna Puja,

359
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,425
so wonderful, you see, to hear this from
the French specially.

360
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:50,859
May God bless you.

361
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:56,150
Now, who else?

362
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:02,310
Yogi: Swiss song in English.

363
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,454
Gregoire: Swiss song in English,
Shri Mataji.

364
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:07,551
Shri Mataji: Good idea.

365
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:15,669
I should get one paper.

366
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:22,440
That’s a good idea, that every country
should have one song, you see,

367
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:32,037
to be sung, so that everyone gets the
chance, and to make a nice positive song.

368
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,760
Yogi: In the page of the Swiss song you
have also the German song,

369
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,517
so you keep the page after.

370
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,525
Shri Mataji: Pen.

371
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:42,403
Yogi: So, the title is “Seed in the Earth”.
