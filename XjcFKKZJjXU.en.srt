1
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:40,627
Today we have all gathered here for 
worshipping your Guru.

2
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:50,090
As you know that the principle of Guru 
resides in the Void.

3
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:58,406
This is the principle which gives you 
balance,

4
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:06,218
which gives you the gravity.

5
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:15,625
The gravity that we have in the Mother 
Earth

6
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:26,021
is expressed through your Guru principle.

7
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:35,345
The first point of gravity is

8
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:46,493
that you should have a personality, 
a character and a temperament

9
00:05:47,249 --> 00:06:01,321
that people would see that you are 
a personality

10
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:08,545
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly 
things.

11
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:22,925
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined 
by the skirmishes of life.

12
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:34,224
Is the personality of a Guru which sits 
down deep into his -

13
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:53,377
into his being and is not easily disturbed 
or dissolved by

14
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,784
any solvent what-so-ever.

15
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:11,974
This is the first principle of the Guru, is 
the gravity.

16
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:18,427
As I told you, it is something which cannot 
be dissolved into anything.

17
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:24,332
It settles very deep down into your 
personality.

18
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:28,949
So it doesn’t float in the water.

19
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:37,258
Now you see, in the countries which are 
developed very much

20
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:50,658
we think that we have a very great power 
of individual attainment.

21
00:07:50,859 --> 00:08:00,488
That individually we are absolutely free, 
we can do whatever we like

22
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:07,756
and that’s why individual freedom becomes 
the goal of all democratic countries,

23
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:14,612
neglecting the collective. Of course, 
individual is important,

24
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:19,204
and it has to become all right to nourish 
the collective.

25
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:25,886
But if the individual does not have 
the gravity,

26
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:36,238
then they float on the surface and anything 
can impress them.

27
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:42,443
That’s why we find today people get 
impressed by fashions.

28
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:53,162
By fashions, which by no logical reason are 
good for your health, for your wisdom.

29
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,659
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

30
00:08:56,216 --> 00:09:06,691
No fashion is good for your health, nor for 
your development as a personality.

31
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:12,870
Sometimes you look so odd with it, 
so funny, so stupid.

32
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:17,959
Then this, ask your question, “What’s 
wrong in becoming stupid?

33
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,314
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

34
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:30,638
The reason is, you have an individual 
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

35
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,838
You personality is zero. You have no 
personality left.

36
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,498
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

37
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,693
Whatever is the fashion you just run after 
that.

38
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:50,973
Is this situation of the Western countries, 
but in the countries like India now

39
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:56,162
there are also in some sort of a craze.

40
00:09:56,384 --> 00:10:04,456
Because they have to still pass through 
this so-called affluence that you have.

41
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:07,532
So they'll take to the crazes, like 
supposing

42
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,866
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with 
someone,

43
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,950
then all rush to buy that carpet.

44
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:18,819
They’ll do anything for getting things 
to themselves.

45
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,856
So they turn towards materialism also 
in the same way

46
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:27,268
as you people turn to fashions.

47
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:36,462
The individuality is all right up to 
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

48
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:43,777
Especially in the west the personality is 
so low, is so missing

49
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:51,632
that any entrepreneur can develop any 
craze, any name

50
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,186
and everybody runs after that and is 
impressed.

51
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:59,795
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by 
some name,

52
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:07,197
say, he can call his… by some funny name - 
now, say "Poison", as he says.

53
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:11,984
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very 
great thing.

54
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:17,999
Because it is by some stupid man who has 
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

55
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,060
It is nothing special about it. It is 
nothing special,

56
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:31,625
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing 
that will make you something great.

57
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:36,437
But people will buy that particular make, 
because it has a brand

58
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:42,158
which everybody will accept. “Oh! 
It’s from that particular brand.”

59
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:46,640
And it’s such a madness about it.

60
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:51,564
Then comes to the anything from hair style, 
up to your foot style,

61
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:56,059
to your neck style, to your nail style, 
to your eyebrow style.

62
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,181
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you 
could do to your body is available

63
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:06,431
and people take to it because they have 
no gravity in them.

64
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:14,269
The persons who have gravity do not take 
to such changes.

65
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,808
First logically, they’ll try to know if 
this change is good or not.

66
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,315
But only because it’s a change, it's 
a craze,

67
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:26,660
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

68
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:32,980
This is one of the signs of gravity in 
a person

69
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:41,049
that he doesn’t float on the ground like 
straws.

70
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:48,263
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful 
pearl

71
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:54,337
in the deep shores of understanding.

72
00:12:55,532 --> 00:13:00,481
So those who are today here to worship 
the Guru,

73
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:03,779
they have to worship their own Guru within 
themselves

74
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,072
and have to understand that first thing 
and foremost thing is

75
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:12,653
that we must have gravity in temperament.

76
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,680
You do not need education for that, 
university education.

77
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:23,374
You need not read books, you need not 
do anything.

78
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,164
Only thing is that you have to have your 
value system corrected.

79
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:36,345
When your value system is corrected, you 
understand

80
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:43,562
what is good for the society, what is good 
for you.

81
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:51,049
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it 
will never emit filth and dirt.

82
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,261
The fragrance will be always there; if it 
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

83
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:02,130
it will emit fragrance only.

84
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:06,983
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

85
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:12,044
Now those who think they are Gurus and have 
achieved that gravity

86
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:20,624
will never write something which is ugly, 
say something which is dirty,

87
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:31,847
will never use their mind to appreciate 
anything that is filthy and wrong.

88
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:39,527
This is the second sign of your value 
system.

89
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:47,581
In your value system you have to first 
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

90
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:52,438
what is Divine beauty,

91
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:59,185
and what is morality of the Spirit.

92
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:06,282
These three things are to be realized and 
are to be part and parcel of your being

93
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:13,397
so that when people see you, they should 
say, “Here is a person we can see

94
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:21,253
who has that gravity, here is the person 
who has that beauty.”

95
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:25,179
It acts inside, outside.

96
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,506
A person who has that sobriety inside 
dresses up in a sober way.

97
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:38,992
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or 
just to show off or to hide something

98
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:46,149
or to expose something. But just to respect 
his body, he dresses up.

99
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,079
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

100
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,501
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless 
things

101
00:15:56,702 --> 00:16:05,319
and things which are of very baser level.

102
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:19,266
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has 
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

103
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:25,392
Like a person tries to become an expert.

104
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:34,918
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be 
an expert in his work,

105
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:40,531
like supposing, there is a person who is 
an engineer.

106
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:45,607
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care 
for fame,

107
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:49,929
he doesn’t care for applauses 
from others.

108
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,175
What he cares is, does he really understand 
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

109
00:16:57,376 --> 00:17:04,807
Musician has to be perfectly a musician. 
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

110
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:11,072
He does not use the general methods 
of expertise,

111
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:17,408
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit 
he tries to improve.

112
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:24,919
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve 
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

113
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,615
but not on the level of money, because 
normally people would write things

114
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:35,215
just to please the majority of the people, 
so they can sell their books

115
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:40,176
or something filthy which is not benevolent 
to the society,

116
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:45,997
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t 
mind, they become shameless about it.

117
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:53,578
So not that the Guru himself has the value 
system, but through his life style,

118
00:17:53,779 --> 00:18:00,289
through his own preachings, through his 
own behavior

119
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,682
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates 
gravity to others.

120
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:16,747
So it builds up our value system, value 
system of a balance.

121
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:21,599
But it does not mean that if somebody wants 
to become an expert on one subject

122
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,638
then he neglects the other side. 
It’s in balance,

123
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,539
it has to be in balance, a person say, 
for example, who is a musician

124
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:39,433
and cannot understand a painting – he is 
not an artist.

125
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,408
Supposing you are an artist and still you 
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

126
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:47,681
then you are not a Yogi.

127
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:55,908
So if you start from the central point of 
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

128
00:18:56,233 --> 00:19:04,557
the knowledge that you receive or whatever 
you give is absolutely integrated

129
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:08,807
and radiates from one point.

130
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:18,584
So, in every way you become an expert, in 
any subject you become an expert.

131
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:22,876
Anybody asks you a question, you know 
everything.

132
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:30,167
But in that you know what is worthless and 
what is of worth.

133
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:36,909
You try to understand what is important.

134
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,268
You know, you give up whatever is worthless 
and you would not like to know

135
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:48,431
the names of different alcohols. You don’t 
want to be expert in that.

136
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:54,226
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing 
all the names of all the carpet styles.

137
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,112
You may not like to know all the varieties 
of sarees.

138
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:02,269
You may not like to know all the names of 
all the cameras.

139
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,505
You may know, but need not feel that you 
do not.

140
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:18,287
But whatever is important for the gravity 
of a personality, you will know.

141
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:26,109
So if you want to make it simple, we can 
know about auspiciousness.

142
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,396
What is auspicious? You’ll know about 
fair play.

143
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,526
What is a fair play towards others.

144
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:42,884
You’ll know about what is justice in 
the eyes of God.

145
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:51,144
You’ll know about the Divine music that 
elevates your Kundalini.

146
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:57,882
So as a result of this gravity you get 
discrimination.

147
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:04,892
That you know what is your personality and 
what is the water surrounding you.

148
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:09,610
You know how to discriminate and this 
discrimination

149
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:16,662
is also actually innately comes from your 
Guru principle.

150
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:22,641
But once this Guru principle goes into

151
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:29,710
a bizarre state or into some sort of 
a turmoil or confusion,

152
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:34,701
by so many other things like you have 
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

153
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:42,382
you have false ideas, you follow false 
doctrines, you follow false theories

154
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:51,082
or you follow false books, then this goes 
bizarre.

155
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:59,685
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha 
Rudra on top of your head.

156
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:09,264
Also in case, when you have problems

157
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:16,173
of not temperant and moderate life, if you 
are an extremist,

158
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:22,956
if you work too hard or you don’t work 
at all or if you only go on

159
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:28,908
projecting yourself into one side and not 
paying attention

160
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:32,376
to the other side of your life,

161
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:37,816
with all these imbalances, physical, 
mental, emotional and spiritual,

162
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:42,391
you develop problems of your Guru 
principle, as a result, you develop

163
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:48,005
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning 
of your destruction.

164
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:52,785
So how important it is to look after your 
Guru principle, you can see

165
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:59,109
that most of the diseases are caused by 
this principle, when neglected

166
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,312
and ultimately they reach its high – their 
heights,

167
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:08,204
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha 
Rudra.

168
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:12,141
Now as realized souls you have crossed 
the limit,

169
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:19,986
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you 
have transcended all those things

170
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:26,571
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not 
mean that you have developed that gravity.

171
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:33,779
You have now achieved a state.

172
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:44,062
If a flower is there and you put the flower 
on the water it will float.

173
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:50,830
But when it becomes the fruit and matures, 
then you put it in the water,

174
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:56,366
it does not float, it goes deep down, it 
doesn’t get dissolved.

175
00:23:56,567 --> 00:24:03,174
It keeps its own identity. That is what is 
to be done now

176
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:11,566
that you have to become the fruits of 
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

177
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:15,900
Blossom time is over now, you have 
to become fruits

178
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:23,083
and people who see you should know 
that you have no imbalances at all.

179
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:31,079
You are the people with special gravity. 
So when you talk to people –

180
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,442
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga 
program,

181
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:43,475
you do not behave in a childish manner or 
stupid manner.

182
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:50,859
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising 
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

183
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:58,749
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid. 
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:06,483
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior 
or behavior without gravity.

185
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:13,436
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you 
have the same style as you had before,

186
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:19,109
then you have to grow, mature, you have 
to become still the fruit.

187
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:29,180
And that is the sign that you become really 
the Guru principle people.

188
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:40,153
It is important that we have to know 
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

189
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:45,362
How she revolves with such a tremendous 
speed

190
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:49,870
holding all of us together to her heart and 
then

191
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:56,083
she emits her beautiful Divine love through 
the various beauties

192
00:25:56,284 --> 00:26:01,703
that are surrounding us, now we can see 
for ourselves.

193
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:06,502
Specially when I see the big mountains,

194
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:14,280
I feel they are like great saints sitting 
and meditating here.

195
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:21,906
But they are the only ones who can catch 
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

196
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:30,969
As you know the sea is the Guru principle, 
and they are so high

197
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,929
that they can catch the Guru principle. So 
despite the fact you have that gravity,

198
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:46,897
you are people of very high standards. And 
you are beyond any temptations,

199
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:55,730
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can 
pervert or spoil others.

200
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:03,380
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts, 
as we had very great people on this earth,

201
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:08,304
I have given you the names and we said that 
there have been ten Gurus,

202
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:15,195
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius, 
we had Socrates

203
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:19,279
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

204
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,105
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten 
great Gurus.

205
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:29,608
Now we have so many here sitting down, they 
are all Gurus

206
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:35,271
and they have to behave like Gurus and 
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

207
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:41,309
And this is what today we have to see if we 
can develop that gravity within ourselves

208
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:50,314
and understanding within ourselves. When 
that peace resides within you,

209
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:57,522
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be 
really felt,

210
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:03,538
will be really understood and will be 
enjoyed by all of you.

211
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:07,296
May God bless you all!

212
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,938
Here is a symbol of a dog because the Guru 
always carries a dog

213
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:29,256
because he is the one who knows only one 
master.

214
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:34,598
And this is the disciple principle of 
the Guru.

215
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,743
So the disciple principle is like a dog, 
who guards the Guru,

216
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:48,807
who shows complete devotion and dedication 
and all the time on the watch

217
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:53,547
that wrong type of people should not come 
to the Guru.

218
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,398
But on the contrary, I think sometimes in 
Sahaja Yoga

219
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,455
people always bring wrong type of people 
to Me.

220
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,235
It watches and it knows, it has such 
discretion.

221
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:08,979
It knows what to do and how to behave.

222
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,609
This is what is the symbol of a disciple

223
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:21,070
and so this symbol has to be understood 
by all of you.

224
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,687
Now for the puja today you sit in a very 
surrendering mood

225
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:36,041
so that this principle awakens within you.

226
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,008
Nobody should try to raise the Kundalini 
or do anything,

227
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:45,228
everything will work out smoothly and 
nicely and nobody should stand up.

228
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:48,543
Everybody should be seated, whichever way 
you like.

229
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:56,740
That's important because as I said this is 
the gravity, to settle down, to settle down.

230
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:04,289
That's very important, as we call Gruhastha 
means the one who settles in the household

231
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,977
is the Gruhastha or we call it in Indian 
language as the baithak,

232
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:16,802
is the sitting capacity, how much you can 
sit down on things.

233
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:22,718
This child, you better ask the child to go 
away. Whose child is this one?

234
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,967
Is very disturbing… one second to that 
child, yes.

235
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:30,918
Just speak him up, that’s all, he’s 
the disturbing one … I don't know...

236
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,568
Let him sit outside, then he will be 
alright. He’s alright.

237
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,609
Sometimes something goes wrong with 
them, you see…

238
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,289
These two girls - they should pay 
attention. Children should not...

239
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,445
These two girls there - they should pay 
attention, that’s important,

240
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:53,825
because that’s how they are going to be 
helped.

241
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:04,367
Now for the puja, Arneau if you come here, 
I’ll be happy, because… Arneau?

242
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:10,394
I’ll tell you how, what to do about these 
musicians.

243
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:14,368
So let the musicians join that side all 
of them who have to sing,

244
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:21,371
for the puja mantras and everything. You 
come so you can guide them.

245
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:24,374
(To the pujari) Now you have to get people 
from Barcelona (?).
