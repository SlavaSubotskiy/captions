00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:26,833
Diwali Puja Talk. Istanbul (Turkey)
November 5, 1994.

2
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:38,522
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,

3
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:43,875
which means the rows of lights

4
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:48,222
 or, you can say, group of lights.

5
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:07,910
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;

6
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,675
it's all right.

7
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:25,987
This Diwali has been a festival of
very ancient times in India.

8
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:48,582
I already told in My previous lectures
 what are these five days are.

9
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:21,748
After killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

10
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:28,884
when it was the darkest night of the year.

11
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:49,960
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times,

12
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:15,394
 because the worst time,  as far as morality’s
concerned

13
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:20,171
 has been in these modern times.

14
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:43,179
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga.

15
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,606
Ghor Kali Yuga

16
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,371
Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst modern times

17
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:13,392
 That means a complete darkness

18
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,838
and, as you see around, you’ll find out

19
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,393
that there is complete darkness

20
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,926
 as far as morality is concerned,

21
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:52,922
but that’s why there are all kinds of crises.

22
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:19,951
Because of that, also,

23
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:24,881
there are many who are seeking the light, the truth.

24
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:44,937
In the darkness of ignorance,

25
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:51,461
people have no knowledge as to what

26
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:57,252
they should do, why or they are on this Earth.

27
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:20,865
As you know very well, that thousands
and thousands of real seekers

28
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,702
who are born at this time,

29
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,951
that is why this job was given to Me

30
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:50,634
is to create Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance.

31
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:17,308
It’s not an easy job because, on one side,

32
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:23,179
we have all the dark forces acting against the truth.

33
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:52,892
Also, on the other side, we have to fight the false people

34
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:58,627
who are taking advantage of your seeking.

35
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:24,662
Firstly, people don’t know what to seek,

36
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,780
so all these false people have been money-oriented

37
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:44,818
and they tried to work out
marketing of their falsehood

38
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:10,719
and they have the expertise to do it.

39
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,399
Somebody asked Me [UNCLEAR], television ....

40
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:33,349
what about the cults that are killing people and doing

41
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:38,725
all sorts of things that they did in Switzerland.

42
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:05,442
So I said it’s true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals

43
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,976
who call themselves as spiritual,

44
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:14,610
but the mistake lies with the people who follow.

45
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:45,548
So a person who is absolutely immoral,

46
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:49,526
absolutely dishonest,

47
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:53,885
who launders money to Swiss banks,

48
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,299
cannot be a guru.

49
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:22,198
He used to buy these drugs and sell them.

50
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:25,854
He used to buy weapons and sell them.

51
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,680
He was worse than his disciples,
much worse.

52
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:12,641
They have used a kind of a suggestion

53
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,320
from the books of so-called Guru Gita or something

54
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:21,349
where it is said you should surrender
 everything to your guru.

55
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:53,787
That means it was to suggest
 that a disciple should be willing

56
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,744
 to surrender everything to the guru.

57
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:20,999
So, it was for the disciple,

58
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,307
but for the guru,
he should not grab anything,

59
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:28,275
he shouldn’t ask for anything,
 he should not be greedy.

60
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:31,621
All these things are already written down.

61
00:16:56,358 --> 00:17:00,455
But nobody reads what is required of a guru

62
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,735
and only they see that

63
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,374
you have to surrender everything to the guru.

64
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,194
Why I’m telling you all this,

65
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:45,983
because how the darkness is
so deep and so dangerous.

66
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:13,225
Moreover, the other day I read an article

67
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,872
who said that in Milan

68
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:20,551
there is a very, very organisation,

69
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:24,737
a global organisation of Satanism.

70
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,949
Many politicians and many people in the government,

71
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:56,031
very highly placed ministers,
prime ministers are involved in it.

72
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:30,519
Many people who are bank managers
or bank owners

73
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,419
and also the people who call
themselves social workers

74
00:19:57,938 --> 00:20:03,908
and also those who have got peace
 award and this award, that award.

75
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:32,519
So this is what is the worst times
of Kali Yuga, modern times.

76
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:51,569
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day,

77
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:59,520
is where a brother and sisters
 celebrate together

78
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,970
 for relationship which is
so pure and so protective.

79
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:35,458
That is to show that, after putting the lights,

80
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:43,184
morality must be the first
 priority for the society.

81
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:11,548
I need not tell you today

82
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:16,267
immoral side of modern times. It’s horrible.

83
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:43,429
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern times

84
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:47,641
where people do not know
how they relate to each other

85
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:19,733
for which, as I told you before,
Christ has suggested

86
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:22,331
that you take out the eyes of a man

87
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:25,174
who looks at a woman twice

88
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:21,208
because He found, at that time, people were horrid.

89
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:39,372
Who can follow Christ in these modern times?

90
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:43,875
Both the eyes, both the hands will be cut off.

91
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,046
On the whole, if you see,

92
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:14,644
I haven’t seen any Christian like that, so far.

93
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:49,787
Mohammed-sahib was even more strict.

94
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:53,077
He thought nothing has been done for the women,

95
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:56,508
so he passed through some regulations about women also.

96
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:39,910
So he said that any woman who looks
 at a man with bad eyes

97
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:45,367
should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning.

98
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:12,373
I don’t know what would have happened
 to the American ladies

99
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,519
 if they have follow this.

100
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,452
So when I came to this Earth

101
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:41,155
I discovered that these two are
 very difficult, specially in Kali Yuga.

102
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,589
These laws are actually meant

103
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:18,674
for not normal human beings,
 but for angels.

104
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:45,590
So modern man is even worse
than a normal human being

105
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:08,319
because they want something destructive all the time,

106
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:12,428
like the Spanish ask the bull to hit them.

107
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:25,846
Now the description of modern times

108
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:35,558
is there to show you in
what times we are living

109
00:30:56,211 --> 00:31:00,300
and I realised this not an easy thing

110
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:04,366
to talk to them about anything

111
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:09,323
that is good without giving them realisation.

112
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:35,757
Unless and until you give them realisation,

113
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:40,132
nothing can penetrate into their minds

114
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,400
on just mental level.

115
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:16,139
And also giving only lectures and sermons,

116
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:19,500
the whole thing will be at a mental level only.

117
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:46,083
And also the religions which are so-called

118
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:52,272
are really very harmful for
the spiritual growth of human beings.

119
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:21,628
I felt that enlightenment is the only way

120
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:24,152
one can save this world.

121
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:44,968
In this darkness of ignorance,

122
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:51,791
the darkest night of the whole history of this world,

123
00:33:53,479 --> 00:34:00,968
we needed light and lights, many lights.

124
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:28,319
Agni,

125
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,501
You to say sanskrit

126
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:34,885
Yes, Agni means fire in Sanskrit language.

127
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,170
All right.

128
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:03,285
So the world divided into so many countries,

129
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:10,326
so many races, so many languages

130
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:15,030
and also their own thinking -

131
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:23,245
think of a global religion

132
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:28,647
was only possible when people got their realisation.

133
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:28,304
So, I had to tell you, human beings,

134
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:32,108
what are their problems.

135
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:50,510
So, in a light, in India,

136
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,676
we have the pot or the container
which is made of clay,

137
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:01,013
then the oil, and then the wick.

138
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:38,131
Now, this body, this mind,

139
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:44,146
you can call all that is visible

140
00:37:44,337 --> 00:37:49,135
and is within, is all the pot

141
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:17,173
and the oil is the compassion, the love

142
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:34,023
and the wick is the Kundalini,
the pure desire,

143
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,194
and the spark is the spirit.

144
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:36,994
So, first of all, the container has to be all right.

145
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,213
It should be all right.

146
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:59,504
It should be able to contain the oil properly

147
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:04,237
and should not allow it to ooze out.

148
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:30,463
Now there are two holes that cause problem.

149
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:35,736
One is your ego.
 Another is your conditionings.

150
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:08,306
So, if a Sahaja Yogi

151
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:13,072
thinks of his conditionings,

152
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,600
that “I am a Christian or, you can say,

153
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,270
that I come from this race,
I’m this community,”

154
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:28,380
so all these limitations with
which we have built ourselves

155
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:33,106
are so flimsy that they break out

156
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:20,434
because there is no reality in them.

157
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:26,203
There’s no substance so they fizzle out.

158
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:58,672
They all act like possessions

159
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:02,406
 and a person becomes absolutely blind.

160
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:35,244
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,
I’ve seen Christians will adhere to Christ,

161
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:40,400
Muslims will adhere to Mohammed-sahib or to Ali

162
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:47,717
and others will adhere to the conditionings
 from which they have come,

163
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,275
but they don’t adhere to Me,

164
00:44:33,283 --> 00:44:39,190
so they cannot see the integration of
 all these personalities in one person.

165
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:14,828
One has to know, on this point,

166
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:19,013
that you have got the light.

167
00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:23,273
You are enlightened.

168
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:45,133
You are not an egg.
You have become a bird.

169
00:45:55,783 --> 00:46:00,895
So you have to give up all that is falsehood.

170
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:28,434
If you are fully enlightened you will give up
automatically, you don’t have to be told.

171
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:54,240
When the light is enlightened,

172
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:58,211
it automatically feel responsible

173
00:46:58,394 --> 00:47:01,150
that it has to give light.

174
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:29,635
Nobody has to tell that
“You please give light”

175
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,906
 because it is light.

176
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:56,991
Because it is eternal light,
nothing can kill it.

177
00:48:19,406 --> 00:48:22,115
I will say a Sanskrit Shloka,

178
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:26,575
Nainam chidanti sashtrani
 Nainam dahanti pavaka

179
00:48:26,585 --> 00:48:30,873
Chayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha

180
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:36,526
means it cannot be killed by [UNCLEAR],

181
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:43,009
not air can blow it away,

182
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,996
 nothing can destroy it.

183
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:53,670
Even if you want to suck it, you cannot.

184
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:58,275
It’s such a powerful light you have got within yourself.

185
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:47,742
You can verify whether it is eternal or not.

186
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:02,258
You should introspect and see for yourself.

187
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:07,825
You’ve got such a unique light within you.

188
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:39,494
Not in the history of this world of spirituality

189
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:46,532
so many have got realisation,
such light within them..

190
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:20,696
So how could these stupid, flimsy,

191
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,580
useless conditionings

192
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:29,563
dominate you now when you are
 the carrier of eternal light?

193
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:04,910
But if you don’t respect this eternal light,

194
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:08,064
then the conditionings will put it out.

195
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:28,626
This is the only problem,

196
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:32,017
that you have the freedom.

197
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,157
You want to have the eternal light, you’ll have it,

198
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:40,827
otherwise this light can be damaged completely.

199
00:53:09,362 --> 00:53:15,100
So, the another hole is that of ego.

200
00:53:28,763 --> 00:53:37,409
One side, conditioning can be resolved
by the sense of responsibility.

201
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:59,934
The same sense of responsibility,

202
00:53:59,959 --> 00:54:05,312
when asserted through ego,
could be very dangerous.

203
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,504
This light can become fire

204
00:54:45,145 --> 00:54:49,033
and it can burn the house of Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:55:08,668 --> 00:55:18,190
A normal life, we know
 that light is for giving us light,

206
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,672
not for burning houses,

207
00:55:41,323 --> 00:55:45,521
but when you get to ego in Sahaja Yoga,

208
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:50,185
you can think that you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

209
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,880
but this responsibility

210
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:27,718
should not give you an idea
 that you are in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

211
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:54,434
So, gradually then, you become so right-sided

212
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,954
and people are surprised that how

213
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:03,403
this man who was normal has become
 like a bull in the china shop.

214
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:07,870
bull in the china shop

215
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,988
bull in the china shop.

216
00:57:13,393 --> 00:57:15,813
English phrase.

217
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,858
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

218
00:58:24,412 --> 00:58:25,959
It’s like government servants.

219
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:30,182
They are suppose to be servants,
 but they are the bosses.

220
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,969
They become bosses.

221
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:09,623
So, the whole understanding

222
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,556
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yoga.

223
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:47,043
The second part is the oil,

224
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:03,919
which is compassion,

225
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:17,844
which is natural, innate and joy-giving.

226
01:00:31,706 --> 01:00:34,657
This oil has to be pure.

227
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:44,312
The compassion has to be pure.

228
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:58,080
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis
try to trouble the leaders.

229
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:19,830
They oppose the leader and try to hinder
the work of Sahaja Yoga.

230
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:40,932
Now, these are suppose to be Sahaja Yogis

231
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:47,374
and they don’t understand if their compassion is pure

232
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:50,061
they will appreciate their leader

233
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:54,309
because the leader is doing such a compassionate work.

234
01:02:31,345 --> 01:02:36,428
Of course, pure compassion, one must understand,

235
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:39,502
has nothing to do with greed,

236
01:02:39,891 --> 01:02:42,575
with temptations, nothing to do.

237
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:08,557
One has to feel such nearness

238
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,036
with the leader and appreciativeness of the work

239
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:16,683
 he or she is putting in.

240
01:03:34,642 --> 01:03:37,499
So Compassion cannot be impure.

241
01:03:37,507 --> 01:03:40,938
There cannot be lust in it.

242
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:07,227
More over this compassion should be
express in such a descent

243
01:04:07,325 --> 01:04:11,667
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

244
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:39,787
Thank God, this one good thing has happened,

245
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:43,344
people don’t kiss you.

246
01:05:04,188 --> 01:05:09,619
First time when I went to western countries,

247
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:15,990
I was just bombarded with kisses.
 I didn’t know what to say — I mean horrible.

248
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:44,371
There may not be anything wrong in the mind,

249
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:48,929
but it’s so indecent and stupid.

250
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:20,940
Long time back

251
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,436
I was told that it was written on Indian airports,

252
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:28,006
 “Please don’t kiss the custom officers.”

253
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:04,605
In modern times a man can kiss a woman,

254
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:08,229
but he can’t kiss a man.
 I mean, it’s absurd.

255
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:46,673
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

256
01:07:46,698 --> 01:07:54,310
now they don’t hug, poor things,
they just touch with hands, each other….

257
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:56,764
they make a goal

258
01:07:57,037 --> 01:08:00,791
 they don’t even hug each other....

259
01:08:30,868 --> 01:08:35,686
So, and now I’ve seen many people who make a goal

260
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,871
and they’re excited, so they run out of the field.

261
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:39,466
They don’t know what to do.

262
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:31,933
So, for Sahaja Yogis,

263
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:35,750
you should know men can kiss men
 and can hug them

264
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:36,775
there’s nothing wrong

265
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,134
and same with the ladies.

266
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:17,705
Otherwise, in excitement, they might
 run out of the field of Sahaja Yoga.

267
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,253
Men need not touch women,
women not touch men. It’s all right.

268
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,399
What is this nonsense?
 You can’t express your love?

269
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:19,682
Say for India we have a rule that
a lady can touch the younger man

270
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,507
and a man can touch a much older women,

271
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,664
who could be a mother, sister-in-law, anyone,

272
01:11:59,725 --> 01:12:04,314
which I think is a good rule because it has worked out.

273
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,210
So, for compassion,

274
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:32,087
it has to have decency as fragrance in the oil.

275
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:01,946
So how do we express our compassion?

276
01:13:11,777 --> 01:13:15,372
We have Rakhi sisters, Rakhi brothers,

277
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,942
but I know of a lady

278
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:34,088
who became friendly with
rich boys as Rakhi brothers.

279
01:14:03,268 --> 01:14:07,140
Or the other way round also, that

280
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:11,898
many boys became Rakhi sisters of rich women.

281
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:42,186
So one has to understand that
 it is not for money that

282
01:14:42,218 --> 01:14:46,521
you should become Rakhi brothers
and sisters and to exploit,

283
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,533
but for compassion.

284
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:27,383
You have to express your Rakhi relationship

285
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:30,688
just for the protection of each other.

286
01:15:52,968 --> 01:15:55,637
The compassion is so joy-giving

287
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:59,861
that you should have not such conditions of money

288
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:06,018
or any other stupid conditions which will kill your joy.

289
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:41,398
But another thing also is that

290
01:16:41,438 --> 01:16:48,523
you express your love you use
some things as presents

291
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:52,224
that gives you joy.

292
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:26,047
That doesn’t mean, by any chance,

293
01:17:26,137 --> 01:17:29,979
that you just give it to your Rakhi sister

294
01:17:30,014 --> 01:17:33,085
and not even to your wife, some present.

295
01:17:53,621 --> 01:17:58,327
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion has to rise

296
01:17:58,353 --> 01:18:04,636
 in the plant, giving love to different parts,

297
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:07,568
indifferent ways, whatever is required

298
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:11,761
and that then evaporates

299
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:15,471
or goes back resource.

300
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:51,269
Attachment is the killer
of pure love and compassion.

301
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:13,087
So try to always find out, introspect.

302
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:16,258
Are you attached  to your children, to your wife

303
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:21,158
or to your Rakhi sister or to anything?
Attached?

304
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:25,292
Then there’s a danger that

305
01:19:25,309 --> 01:19:29,572
you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

306
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:17,592
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely detached

307
01:20:17,934 --> 01:20:26,905
and nourishing the different relationships
that you have in a proper way,

308
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:30,042
your joy is perfect.

309
01:21:02,294 --> 01:21:06,445
Ambition is another killer of joy.

310
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,798
So, if you have to be ambitious,

311
01:21:24,807 --> 01:21:27,961
you have to be only ambitious only about Sahaja Yoga,

312
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,511
so that you humble down.

313
01:22:06,124 --> 01:22:14,390
One promise in Sahaja Yoga is
that your life will be full of joy.

314
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:44,374
There is no need to take out your eyes,
cut your hands, no punishments.

315
01:23:00,905 --> 01:23:06,179
If you have too many holes,
need not come to Sahaj Yoga.

316
01:23:20,942 --> 01:23:25,854
You have to become real holy person,
not full of holes.

317
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:48,489
I must say that you are all “your holinesses.”

318
01:24:04,654 --> 01:24:08,662
I am not because I’ve not become.
You have become.

319
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:22,577
Supposing, somebody has to call you
as a man, will they say,

320
01:24:22,593 --> 01:24:28,271
 “Oh, man, such and such”?
 No, because you are a man.

321
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:04,152
Whatever you achieve is attached to you,
 whatever you have achieved.

322
01:25:26,259 --> 01:25:29,928
Russian seems to be long translation

323
01:25:33,892 --> 01:25:37,056
and sometimes very small

324
01:25:37,144 --> 01:25:43,026
and sometimes Romanian sometimes very short,
sometimes very long.

325
01:25:54,797 --> 01:26:03,057
All right, so now the another thing
that is promised is bliss.

326
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:27,819
What is bliss is the experience of joy.

327
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:38,689
It can come from anything.

328
01:26:55,918 --> 01:27:04,427
Maybe you find you were in an accident
and you were suddenly saved, protected.

329
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:08,039
You are amazed and everybody feels the bliss.

330
01:27:08,064 --> 01:27:10,451
You also feel the bliss.

331
01:28:04,806 --> 01:28:07,599
To be very frank, I cannot translate.

332
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:13,929
I know languages, but from one language
 to another, I cannot translate.

333
01:28:13,964 --> 01:28:16,744
There’s something wrong with Me.

334
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:22,360
Yogi: “But you understand very well,
Shri Mataji, what we say.”

335
01:28:37,293 --> 01:28:39,737
That is very easy.

336
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:43,993
See the thoughts, first is an abstract form.

337
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:01,576
That’s an abstract form,

338
01:29:01,584 --> 01:29:04,181
that’s all I said.

339
01:29:46,457 --> 01:29:50,925
All right, but thank you very much.

340
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:57,376
So, it is — you see, at that point

341
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:02,324
anybody can know what is the thought is

342
01:30:02,349 --> 01:30:07,696
because later on it becomes a language, takes words.

343
01:30:43,035 --> 01:30:48,138
All right, so if you can jump at that abstract,

344
01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:52,921
then you know that, but you have to
put attention quite a lot.

345
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:33,242
So, you have to pay attention
"to that abstract point to continuous"

346
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:53,472
All right, so now, to solve this problem,

347
01:31:53,497 --> 01:31:57,427
I would request you all, to learn,
 at least, English language.

348
01:32:07,766 --> 01:32:11,718
I’m not saying Sanskrit, but English.

349
01:32:34,867 --> 01:32:38,017
Now, it is the Kundalini,

350
01:32:38,081 --> 01:32:40,273
which is a pure desire,

351
01:32:40,282 --> 01:32:44,849
is already existing,
you don’t have to do anything.

352
01:33:05,534 --> 01:33:09,636
Maybe the cotton is not clean.

353
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:13,101
It has some problems

354
01:33:13,466 --> 01:33:19,789
because it has passed through dirty hands,

355
01:33:19,855 --> 01:33:24,015
but it can be clean.

356
01:33:25,668 --> 01:33:28,520
The cotton [UNCLEAR]

357
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,528
may not be clean

358
01:33:30,553 --> 01:33:33,132
but it can be clean

359
01:33:40,353 --> 01:33:42,471
Cotton wool, I mean.

360
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:15,314
Kabira has said something very beautiful about it.

361
01:34:26,783 --> 01:34:33,133
He says that when the intestine

362
01:34:33,285 --> 01:34:38,029
of a goat are inside the stomach,

363
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:43,700
they say, “May, may, may,” means “I, I, I.”

364
01:35:14,022 --> 01:35:19,435
But when they are pulled out and arevmade into strings

365
01:35:47,898 --> 01:35:56,577
and put on an instrument for
cleaning the cotton wool —

366
01:35:57,789 --> 01:36:02,428
put on the instrument that cleans the cotton wool.

367
01:36:02,454 --> 01:36:05,993
You know, in India we call it dhunakt ,dhunki.

368
01:36:40,096 --> 01:36:45,375
And when it is being strung, it  says, “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi,”

369
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,395
means  “You, you are, you are, you are.”

370
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:55,658
All right, whatever it is.

371
01:37:55,786 --> 01:38:05,525
So, it means that when your Kundalini
not working out well

372
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:10,194
because there are problems in your chakras,

373
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:15,687
what you have to say,
 “You are, you are.” You say that.

374
01:38:15,711 --> 01:38:19,684
 “You are Sakshat this.
You are Sakshat that.”

375
01:38:54,397 --> 01:38:57,763
Sakshat means “in reality.” In reality.

376
01:39:16,126 --> 01:39:19,317
You don’t say, “You are Her Holiness something.”

377
01:39:19,374 --> 01:39:24,094
You say, “You are Ganesha. You are this.”

378
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:52,004
That is how you cleanse all the dirt

379
01:39:52,092 --> 01:39:58,400
or all the problems of your chakras.

380
01:40:15,866 --> 01:40:22,430
By this, you also correct
your conditionings and your ego.

381
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,578
Then you do not take the credit for anything.

382
01:40:42,678 --> 01:40:45,780
You do not feel you are doing something

383
01:41:04,951 --> 01:41:10,696
and the whole personality changes

384
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:17,181
into a complete instrument like the flute

385
01:41:17,206 --> 01:41:21,167
in the hands of Shri Krishna.

386
01:41:46,429 --> 01:41:48,976
Then you see your work,

387
01:41:49,016 --> 01:41:54,171
everything as the work of the Divine.

388
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:20,753
That is how you become enlightened.

389
01:42:27,216 --> 01:42:32,114
That is how you become the light of joy, of peace.

390
01:42:49,543 --> 01:42:53,375
What has been  said about what you are.

391
01:42:57,958 --> 01:43:03,243
That is how, see, is whatever is described about,

392
01:43:03,363 --> 01:43:05,906
you become that.

393
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:27,103
If there is a light you don’t have to say

394
01:43:27,135 --> 01:43:30,914
that it is a light, it is.

395
01:43:51,814 --> 01:43:55,702
It is not a stamp that you have to use.

396
01:44:15,006 --> 01:44:23,287
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali
of the lights of Sahaja Yoga.

397
01:44:36,695 --> 01:44:43,649
I don’t know what to say,
in what state of bliss I am.

398
01:45:03,017 --> 01:45:11,147
All the ripples you have created
 of joy are overwhelming for it.

399
01:45:45,402 --> 01:45:47,663
No words can describe.

400
01:45:47,787 --> 01:45:52,374
I cannot compose poetry.

401
01:46:03,979 --> 01:46:09,695
Keep this light burning beautifully through meditation

402
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:39,321
and you can become very strong
because of light.

403
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:57,523
May God bless you, Happy Diwali to all of you.

404
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:23,535
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one

405
01:47:23,567 --> 01:47:29,604
and my lecture have been three times said so

406
01:47:29,672 --> 01:47:35,769
you can imagine the time is been
more spend than normal.

407
01:48:01,079 --> 01:48:08,010
Lastly there are many invited in India free.

408
01:48:08,562 --> 01:48:13,549
Most of them may not also pay,

409
01:48:13,573 --> 01:48:18,061
those who cannot pay for travel should let us know.

410
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:49,285
No no, we have invited many people to India.

411
01:48:49,341 --> 01:48:57,312
They should give their names and
those who are free for Ganapatipule

412
01:48:57,337 --> 01:49:00,530
but who have paid for the travelling

413
01:49:00,548 --> 01:49:05,005
and those who have not paid for travelling also should give their names.

414
01:49:46,845 --> 01:49:54,469
Also some of the letters who cannot paid are invited.

415
01:50:12,633 --> 01:50:14,434
May God bless you all.
