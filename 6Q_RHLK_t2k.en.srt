1
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,100
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,
which means the rows of lights or, you can

2
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,740
say, group of lights.

3
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;
it's all right.

4
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:29,389
This Diwali has been a festival of very ancient
times in India. I already told in My previous

5
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,840
lectures what are these five days are. After
killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

6
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:29,609
when it was the darkest night of the year.
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern

7
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:21,369
times, because the worst time, as far as morality’s
concerned has been in these modern times.

8
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,899
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga. And as you
see around you’ll find out that there is

9
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:47,369
complete darkness as far as morality’s concerned,
but that's why there are all kinds of crisies.

10
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:02,279
Because of that, also, there are many who
are seeking the light, the truth.

11
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:13,590
In the darkness of ignorance - people have
no knowledge as to what they should do, why

12
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:24,409
or they are on this Earth. As you know very
well, that thousands and thousands of real

13
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,610
seekers who are born at this time. That is
why this job was given to Me is to create

14
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:47,219
Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance. It's
not an easy job because, on one side, we have

15
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:06,319
all the dark forces acting against the truth.
Also, on the other side, we have to fight

16
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,140
the false people who are taking advantage
of your seeking. Firstly, people don't know

17
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:35,110
what to seek, so all these false people have
been money-oriented and they tried to work

18
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,809
out marketing of their falsehood, and they
have the expertise to do it.

19
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:45,809
Somebody asked Me in Bogotá, a television
lady: “What about the cults that are killing

20
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:56,710
people and doing all sorts of things that
they did in Switzerland?”

21
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:04,150
So I said, “It's true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals who

22
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:13,439
call themselves as spiritual, but the mistake
lies with the people who follow them.”

23
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,110
So a person who is absolutely immoral, absolutely
dishonest, who launders money to Swiss banks,

24
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:32,700
cannot be a guru. He used to buy these drugs
and sell them. He used to buy weapons and

25
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:44,789
sell them. He was worse than his disciple,
much worse. They have used a kind of a suggestion

26
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:51,789
from the books of so-called Guruvita or something
where it is said you should surrender everything

27
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:02,689
to your guru. That means it was to suggest
that a disciple should be willing to surrender

28
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,659
everything to the guru.

29
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:15,200
So, it was for the disciple; but for the guru,
he should not grab anything, he shouldn't

30
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,200
ask for anything, he should not be greedy.
All these things are already written down.

31
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:30,249
But nobody reads what is required of a guru
and only they see that you have to surrender

32
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,279
everything to the guru.

33
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,279
Why I'm telling you all this? Because how
the darkness is so deep and so dangerous.

34
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:50,149
Moreover, the other day I read an article
which said that in Milan there is a very,

35
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:57,809
very organization, a global organization of
satanicism. Many politicians and many people

36
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:04,939
in the government, very highly placed ministers
- prime ministers - are involved in it. Many

37
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,379
people who are bank managers or bank owners,
and also the people who call themselves social

38
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,350
workers, and also those who have got peace
award and this award, that award. So this

39
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,470
is what is the worst times of Kali Yuga, modern
times.

40
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,470
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day, is
where a brother and sisters celebrate together

41
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,970
for relationship, which is so pure and so
protective. That is to show that, after putting

42
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,729
the lights, morality must be the first priority
for the society. I need not tell you this

43
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:47,640
today immoral side of modern times. It's horrible.
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern

44
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,100
times where people don’t know how they relate
to each other for which, as I told you before,

45
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Christ has suggested that you take out the
eyes of a man who looks at a woman twice,

46
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,260
because He found, at that time, people were
horrid. Who can follow Christ in these modern

47
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,260
times? Both the eyes, both the hands will
be cut off. On the whole, if you see, I haven't

48
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,850
seen any Christian like that, so far.

49
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,850
Mohammed Sahib was even more strict. He thought
nothing has been done for the women, so he

50
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:41,310
passed through some regulations about women
also. So he said that any woman who looks

51
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:48,310
at a man with bad eyes should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning. I don't know

52
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,340
what would have happened to the American ladies,
if they had followed this.

53
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,690
So when I came to this earth I discovered
that these two are very difficult, especially

54
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,390
in Kali Yuga. These laws are actually meant
for not normal human beings, but for angels.

55
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,440
So, modern man is even worse than a normal
human being, because they want something destructive

56
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,099
all the time, like the Spanish ask the bull
to hit them.

57
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:26,099
Now the description of modern times is there
to show you in what times we are living. And

58
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,630
I realized it's not an easy thing to talk
to them about anything that is good without

59
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,369
giving them realization. Unless and until
you give them realization, nothing can penetrate

60
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:48,650
into their minds on just mental level. And
also giving only lectures and sermons, the

61
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,690
whole thing will be at a mental level only.
And also the religions, that are so-called,

62
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,929
are really very harmful for the spiritual
growth of human beings. I felt that enlightenment

63
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:03,460
is the only way one can save this world. In
this darkness of ignorance, the darkest night

64
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,310
of the whole history of this world, we needed
light and lights, many lights.

65
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,310
[Shri Mataji speaks aside to the interpreter/translator:
“Agni? Did you say in Sanskrit? Yes, Agni

66
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,630
means fire in Sanskrit language.]

67
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:29,630
All right. So the world divided into so many
countries, so many races, so many languages

68
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,940
and also their own thinking - to think of
a global religion was only possible when people

69
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,030
got their realization.

70
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:46,030
So, I had to study human beings, what are
their problems. So, in a light, in India,

71
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,190
we have the pot or the container, which is
made of clay, then the oil, and then the wick.

72
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,770
Now, this body, this mind, we can call all
that is visible and is within, is all the

73
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:16,280
pot, and the oil is the compassion, the love.
And the wick is the Kundalini, the pure desire,

74
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:25,590
and the spark is the Spirit. So, the - first
of all the container has to be all right.

75
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,650
It should be able to contain the oil properly
and should not allow it to ooze out.

76
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,919
Now there are two holes that cause problem.
One is your ego, another your conditionings.

77
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:41,289
So, if a Sahaja Yogi thinks of his conditionings,
that "I am a Christian,” or, he can say,

78
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:47,849
that, “I come from this race, I'm this community."
So all these limitations with which we have

79
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:54,849
built ourselves are so flimsy that they break
out, because there’s no reality in them.

80
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,390
There's no substance, so they fizzle out.
They all act like possessions and a person

81
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,400
becomes absolutely blind.

82
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,419
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen Christians
will adhere to Christ, Muslims will adhere

83
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:12,780
to Mohammed Sahib or to Ali, and others will
adhere to the conditionings from which they

84
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,780
have come. But they don't adhere to Me, so
they cannot see the integration of all these

85
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:29,220
personalities in One Person. Now, one has
to know, on this point, that you have got

86
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,119
the light. You are enlightened. You are not
an egg. You have become a bird. So, you have

87
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,909
to give up all that is falsehood.

88
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:45,479
If you are fully enlightened, you will give
up automatically, you don’t have to be told.

89
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:49,349
When the light is enlightened, it automatically
feels responsible that it has to give light.

90
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:56,349
Nobody has to tell that, "You please give
light" because it is light now. Because it

91
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:04,849
is eternal light, nothing can kill it. I will
say a Sanskrit shloka , [Shri Mataji speaks

92
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,840
in Sanskrit] - means it cannot be killed by
anyone, not air can blow it away, nothing

93
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,609
can destroy it. The - even if you want to
suck it, you cannot. It's such a powerful

94
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:21,609
light you have got within yourself. You can
verify whether it is eternal or not. You should

95
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:30,849
introspect and see for yourself. You've got
such a unique light within you. Not in the

96
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,570
history of this world of spirituality so many
have got realization, such light within them.

97
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,570
So how could these stupid, flimsy, useless
conditionings dominate you now when you are

98
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:56,299
the carrier of eternal light? But if you don't
respect this eternal life, then the conditionings

99
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:08,460
will put it off. This is the only problem,
that you have the freedom. You want to have

100
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,119
the eternal life, you'll have it, otherwise
this light can be damaged completely.

101
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,890
So, the another hole is that of ego. One side,
conditioning can be resolved by the sense

102
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,549
of responsibility. The same sense of responsibility,
when asserted through ego, could be very dangerous.

103
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,549
This light can become fire and it can burn
the house of Sahaja Yoga. In normal life,

104
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:38,700
we know that light is for giving us light,
not for burning houses; but when you get to

105
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:48,890
ego in Sahaja Yoga, you can think that you
are responsible for Sahaja Yoga, but this

106
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:56,310
responsibility should not give you an idea
that you are in charge of Sahaja Yoga. So,

107
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:08,179
then gradually you become so right-sided and
people are surprised that how this man who

108
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,150
was normal has become like a bull in the china
shop.

109
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:22,150
So you are not in charge of Sahaja Yoga. It's
like government servants. They are supposed

110
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,979
to be servants, but they are the bosses. They
become bosses. So the whole understanding

111
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:33,929
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaja Yoga.

112
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,109
The second part is the oil, which is compassion,
which is natural, innate and joy-giving. This

113
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:46,109
oil has to be pure. The compassion has to
be pure. I have seen many Sahaja Yogis try

114
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,480
to trouble the leaders. They oppose the leader
and try to hinder the work of Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,170
Now, these are supposed to be Sahaja Yogis
and they don't understand that if their compassion

116
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,900
is pure they will appreciate their leader
because the leader is doing such a compassionate

117
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:12,900
work. Of course, pure compassion, one must
understand, has nothing to do with greed,

118
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:20,970
with temptations, is nothing to do. One has
to feel such nearness with the leader and

119
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,820
appreciativeness of the work he or she is
putting in. So, compassion cannot be impure.

120
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,240
There cannot be lust in it. Moreover, this
compassion should be expressed in such a decent

121
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,750
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

122
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,350
Thank God to AIDS, one good thing has happened,
don’t - people don't kiss you. First time

123
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:49,020
when I went to Western countries, I was just
bombarded with kisses. I didn't know what

124
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:56,020
to say – I mean, it’s horrible. There
may not be anything wrong in the mind, but

125
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:05,580
it's so indecent and stupid. Long time back
I was told it was written on Indian airports,

126
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,590
"Please don't kiss the custom officers." [laughter]
In modern times a man can kiss a woman, but

127
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:17,590
he can't kiss a man. I mean, it's absurd.
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

128
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,020
now they don't even hug, poor things, they
just touch with hands.... So, and now I've

129
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:32,020
seen many people who make a goal and are excited,
so they run out of the field. They don't know

130
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,680
what to do.... [laughter]

131
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,680
So, for Sahaja Yogis, we should know men can
kiss men and can hug them - there's nothing

132
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,300
wrong - and same with the ladies. Otherwise,
in excitement, they might run out of the field

133
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,900
of Sahaja Yoga. Men need not touch women,
women need not touch men. It's all right.

134
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,900
What is this nonsense? You can't express your
love? Say for India we have a rule that a

135
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:15,190
lady can touch the younger man and a man can
touch a much older woman, who could be a mother,

136
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,710
sister-in-law, anyone, which I think is a
good rule because it has worked out.

137
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,710
So, for compassion, it has to have decency
as fragrance in the oil. So how do we express

138
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:38,160
our compassion? We have rakhi sisters, rakhi
brothers, but I know of a lady who became

139
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,370
friendly with rich boys as rakhi brothers.
Or the other way round also, that many boys

140
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,930
became rakhi sisters of rich women - Racki
brothers

141
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:03,930
So, one has to understand that it is not for
money that you should become rakhi brothers

142
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:18,210
and sisters and to exploit, but for compassion.
You have to express your rakhi relationship

143
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:27,450
just for the protection of each other. The
compassion is so joy giving that you should

144
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,380
have not such conditions of money or any other
such stupid conditions which will kill your

145
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,900
joy. But another thing also is that to express
your love, you use some things as presents

146
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,560
that gives you joy. That doesn't mean, by
any chance, that you just give it to your

147
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,280
rakhi sister and not even to your wife, some
present.

148
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,840
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion
has to rise in the plant, giving love to different

149
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,690
parts, in different ways, whatever is required,
and that it then evaporates or goes back to

150
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:16,690
its source. Attachment is the killer of pure
love and compassion. So try to always find

151
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,530
out, introspect. Are you attached to your
children, to your wife or to your rakhi sister

152
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,270
or to anything, attached? Then there's a danger
that you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

153
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,240
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely
detached and nourishing the different relationships

154
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,890
that you have in a proper way, your joy is
perfect. Ambition is another killer of joy.

155
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,800
So, if you have to be ambitious, you have
to be only ambitious about Sahaja Yoga, so

156
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:48,800
that you humble down. One promise in Sahaja
Yoga, is that your life will be full of joy.

157
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,550
There is no need to take out your eyes, cut
your hands, no punishments. If you have too

158
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,520
many holes, you need not come to Sahaj Yoga.
You have to become a real holy person, not

159
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,020
full of holes. I must say that you are all
"your holinesses." I’m not. I’m not, because

160
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,310
I've not become. You have become. Supposing,
somebody has to call you as a man, will they

161
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:17,310
say, "Oh, man, such and such"? No, because
you are a man. What you - whatever you achieve

162
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,390
is attached to you, whatever you have achieved.

163
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,930
[Shri Mataji commenting on translators: “This
Russian seems to be long translation, and

164
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,400
sometimes very small, and sometimes Romanian
very short, sometimes very long.”] [Laughter]

165
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,820
All right, so now the another thing that is
promised is bliss. What is bliss is the experience

166
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:41,250
of joy. It can come from anything. Maybe you
find you were in an accident, and you were

167
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,860
suddenly saved, protected. You are amazed,
and everybody feels the bliss. You also feel

168
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,300
the bliss.

169
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,790
[Laughter. Shri Mataji commenting on translation:
“To be very frank, I cannot translate. I

170
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:58,640
know languages, but from one language to another,
I cannot translate. That’s something wrong

171
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,600
with Me.”]

172
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,810
[Yogi: "But you understand very well, Shri
Mataji, what we say."]

173
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:11,810
[Shri Mataji: Well, it is very easy. See the
thought first is in an abstract form …(translation)…It’s

174
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:23,390
an abstract form, that's all I said. [laughs]
]

175
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:30,390
[The Russian yogi gives a very long translation.
"This is the reverse, Shri Mataji."] [Laughter]

176
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,150
All right, but thank you very much.

177
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,150
So, it is - you see, the - at that point anybody
can know what is the thought is because later

178
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:52,780
on it becomes a language, takes words. So,
if you can jump at that abstract, then you’ll

179
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:03,840
know that, but you have to put attention quite
a lot. Now, you have to pay attention to that

180
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,580
abstract form, you see, continuously

181
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:17,580
So now, to solve this problem, I would request
you all, to learn, at least, English language.

182
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,130
[applause] I'm not saying Sanskrit, but English.

183
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:32,130
Now, it’s the Kundalini, which is a pure
desire, is already existing; you don't have

184
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:42,300
to do anything. Maybe the cotton is not clean.
It has some problems, because it has passed

185
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,600
through dirty hands, but it can be cleaned.
Kabir has said something very beautiful about

186
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:04,510
it. He says that when the intestines of a
goat are inside the stomach, they say, "Mai,

187
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:15,330
mai, mai," means "I, I, I." But when they
are pulled out and are made into strings,

188
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,120
and put on a instrument for cleaning the cotton
wool - put on the instrument that cleans the

189
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,820
cotton wool. You know, in India we call it
"Duna." And when it is being strung, it says,

190
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,820
"Tu hi, tu hi, tu hi," means "You, you are,
you are, you are."

191
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,350
[Shri Mataji and the translators discuss these
words.]

192
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:01,420
All right, whatever it is. So, it means that
when your Kundalini is not working out well

193
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,250
because there are problems in your chakras,
what you have to say, "You are, you are."

194
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:13,250
You say that. "You are sakshat this. You are
sakshat that." Sakshat means "in reality."

195
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:29,260
In reality. You don't say, "You are Her Holiness
something." You said, "You are Ganesha. You

196
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,780
are this." That is how you cleanse all the
dirt or all the problems of your chakras.

197
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,250
By this, you also correct your conditionings
and your ego. Then you do not take the credit

198
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:53,250
for anything. You do not feel you are doing
something, and the whole personality changes

199
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:03,680
into a complete instrument like the flute
in the hands of Shri Krishna. Then you see

200
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:10,750
your work, everything as the work of the Divine.
That is how you become enlightened. That is

201
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,320
how you become the light of joy, of peace.
A lot has been said about what you are. That

202
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is how, you see, is whatever is described
about, you become that. If there is a light,

203
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:16,410
you don’t have to say that it is a light.
It is. It is not a stamp that you have to

204
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,040
use.

205
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:55,040
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali of the
lights of Sahaja Yoga. I don't know what to

206
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:13,470
say, in what state of bliss I am. All the
ripples you have created of joy are overwhelming

207
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:29,530
for Me. No words can describe. I cannot compose
poetry. Keep this light burning beautifully

208
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:08,800
through meditation, and you can become very
strong beacons of light.

209
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:29,810
May God bless you, it’s Happy Diwali to
all of you.

210
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,820
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one,
and My lecture has been three times said,

211
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:48,630
so you can imagine the time has been more
spent than normal.

212
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:01,830
Lastly, there are many who are invited in
India free. Most of them may not also pay.

213
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Those who cannot pay for travel should let
us know… No, no - we have invited many people

214
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,480
to India. They should give their names, and
those who are free, I mean free for Ganapatipule,

215
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:13,419
but they are paying for their traveling. And
those who

216
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:58,889
are not paying for traveling also should give

217
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:09,429
their names. Also some of

218
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:54,639
the leaders who cannot pay are invited.

219
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:24,379
May God bless you all.
