1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:13,130
is spiritual evolution of man.

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:20,689
In my last three lectures, I’ve already
explained about the residual force called

3
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:27,970
as Kundalini that resides in the triangular
bone here.

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:49,519
This residual force gives us the second birth.

5
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,930
But how did we become human beings?

6
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,950
Though known to us, we do not know why we
became human beings.

7
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:16,530
All the scientists must ask this question,
“Why did we become human beings?

8
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:27,860
Is there 
any meaning to this human life?

9
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:46,490
Or are we born just to eat our food, produce
children, keep money for them, and then die?”

10
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,770
If you make any instrument – for example,
this instrument [microphone] – you always

11
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,750
have a purpose behind it.

12
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:08,289
I’ve read a very good book by a gentleman,
who was a French gentleman, whose name was

13
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,520
[UNCLEAR Dunoire] – maybe I am not good
at pronunciation – who wrote that, “It

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:43,480
is impossible to produce a human being in
this short time since the Earth seceded from

15
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,290
the Sun."

16
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:57,280
That means if you use the law of chance, you
cannot explain this fast movement of development

17
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:34,280
of a small carbon atom into a human being
in such a short time.

18
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:44,340
According to him, there must be a juggler
behind it to do this.

19
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,170
As I’ve told you before that this I put
forward before you as a hypothesis and you

20
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,540
must keep your mind open as any scientific
personality does.

21
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:14,120
If it comes true, then you have to believe
into it.

22
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:23,659
Yesterday I talked about the all-pervading
power which is 

23
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:28,470
the Truth.

24
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:41,780
Yesterday those who were here got their realization
and they felt the power flowing from their

25
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:49,030
hands, clearly.

26
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,330
And they felt absolutely blissful.

27
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:02,680
They also saw small children checking them,
their vibrations.

28
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:17,280
So it is true that man has not yet discovered
his meaning, so he has to become connected

29
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:31,680
with the mains as any instrument has to.

30
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,490
This is what is the spiritual evolution of
man.

31
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:50,139
When a human consciousness gets enlightened
or there is a breakthrough into the unconscious

32
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,710
then only we can say that we have evolved
fully.

33
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,440
We can understand human evolution on the same
way as we have the instruments set for spacecrafts.

34
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,240
In one spacecraft, an instrument is placed
first, the lowest capsule, which explodes

35
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,530
and accelerates the rate of the second capsule.

36
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:23,200
One lower end capsule, and then there’s
another one, and there’s another one and

37
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:50,759
this one has the spacecraft in it.

38
00:06:50,759 --> 00:07:07,530
So if this moves with the velocity of three,
the explosion in this one (lower capsule)

39
00:07:07,530 --> 00:08:13,270
makes it three raise to the power, say, ten
and this one makes it three raise to power,

40
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,870
say, 20.

41
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,870
It goes on like that.

42
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,810
So the acceleration is very fast.

43
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,520
So ultimately this is thrown and triggered
into the space.

44
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:40,980
This all comes as a bundle, to begin with.

45
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:52,250
In the same way, a human being is, first of
all, exploded into his physical.

46
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:16,330
The physical expresses into his mental being,
then into his emotional being, then into his

47
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,520
spiritual being.

48
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:31,390
And then he should stop into his Spirit.

49
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:42,320
That is the space of the all-pervading power.

50
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:55,900
In us exist all the physical, mental,emotional
and spiritual beings.

51
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:23,820
Today, as the time is, man is so matured that
he is more spiritual than physical.

52
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:32,490
But the matter is so much attached to the
Spirit, that it is difficult for him to understand

53
00:10:32,490 --> 00:11:06,740
that the gap between the matter, the spiritual
and the physical and other things 

54
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,890
is not so much binding.

55
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:26,160
For example, all the affluent countries have
a problem of suicide 

56
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,660
and the suicide is much more, the more you
are affluent.

57
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:42,220
I had some young girls from Sweden who came
from Cambridge University, hardly about 20

58
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:55,880
years of age.

59
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:04,890
And when I saw their vibrations I was amazed;
they were numb, just like a dead person’s

60
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,720
vibrations.

61
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:30,580
Otherwise, they were alright, they were children
of rich people educating themselves.

62
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,240
So I asked them what do you think all the
time?

63
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,080
What do you plan?

64
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:42,120
They told me, to my amazement, that they are
planning how to commit suicide.

65
00:12:42,120 --> 00:13:01,650
I was 
so surprised and so hurt and unhappy and pained.

66
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:12,390
With what care God has created them from amoeba
to this stage and they are here to destroy

67
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:25,130
themselves?

68
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,750
I asked them what do you want?

69
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,850
Do you want money?

70
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,630
Do you want love?

71
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,990
What do you want?

72
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,190
And I called them to my house and made them
sit down and I talked to them.

73
00:13:46,190 --> 00:14:02,980
I felt that they didn’t know what they wanted.

74
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:12,730
But they said that we are very unhappy in
life, as if there is some gap between us and

75
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,220
ourselves.

76
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:29,230
Perhaps we do not know what is our significance
in this life.

77
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:41,970
Then I told them that you can find your significance
and why should you be that desperate?

78
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:52,550
The God Almighty who has made you with this
care, with this consistently working on you

79
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,450
for ages, has made you a human being.

80
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:14,220
He must have made some arrangement for you
to find your own significance.

81
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,220
And He has made all the arrangements, as we
make for an instrument to have a cord to be

82
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,120
attached to the mains.

83
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:40,610
That is 
this Kundalini which is placed here.

84
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,660
Thousands of years back in India, people had
discovered the existence of Kundalini.

85
00:15:46,660 --> 00:16:02,470
Search in the West started, after Rousseau,
into outside.

86
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,760
But they could not enter inside.

87
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,840
They thought it is better to search outside.

88
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:20,820
Because they could not enter inside, they
thought it was better to search outside.

89
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:33,780
But as you were searching outside, there was
a search inside going on, too.

90
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:49,400
In that search they discovered this Kundalini
being the source of our breakthrough.

91
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:58,710
We have evolved through a force that exists
within us on this center called as the Nabhi

92
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:14,500
center or the Navel center.

93
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:37,509
By giving us sustenance, by giving us our
quality, our nature, or our natural religion

94
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:43,470
that we were made into a human being.

95
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:54,299
If you see in a chemical periodic law, you
will be amazed how all these elements are

96
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:10,679
arranged such a way, in a big beautiful chart,
and how the carbon atom, when it came into

97
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:21,460
existence, we started becoming alive.

98
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:32,720
That carbon atom is placed within us here.

99
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,410
Here is the innocence of the matter.

100
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,299
Matter is innocent.

101
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:50,830
Up to the animal stage we are absolutely innocent.

102
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,360
Even human children are innocent, mostly.

103
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:10,139
But we lose our innocence when we start using
these two powers, one of desiring and another

104
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,909
of action.

105
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:22,850
We create the ego and superego by which we’ve
become a human being.

106
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:31,140
That’s how you become your Self.

107
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,720
That means you become independent.

108
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,929
You have all freedom to behave as you like.

109
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:54,440
In that freedom only, you grasp the idea of
the beyond.

110
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:02,159
These ideas come to you through your dreams.

111
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:10,659
Most of the paintings and the great arts are
produced through the understanding of the

112
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,299
unconscious.

113
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:31,499
Our unconscious guides it all the time to
warn us about our evolution.

114
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:40,290
Jung has described it very clearly.

115
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:46,279
He has experimented with thousands of people
of different parts of the world.

116
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:55,869
He says this unconscious gives the balance,
the coordination, the future guidance through

117
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:15,850
your dreams.

118
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:23,840
That means our guidance has been there, we
have a desire and we have an idea that there

119
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,399
is something beyond.

120
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:46,539
That means that we have a desire that we have
to rise and that there is something beyond.

121
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:53,570
And also there is guidance coming from the
unconscious.

122
00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:06,409
But there is another guidance which has come
to us from God.

123
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:13,909
This is very much believed into in India.

124
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:24,110
Even in the Western world, if they follow
Christianity or Judaism, they believe it.

125
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:39,169
It is believed that at that spot resides the
power of God which evolves.

126
00:22:39,169 --> 00:23:02,580
This area according to Indian mythology is
governed by a power called Lakshmi, which

127
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:17,860
on one side gives us our sustenance and on
the other side guides us how to behave.

128
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:26,429
And from the same power, the male form of
that power incarnates, again and again, to

129
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:35,100
guide the people, in human form.

130
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:59,399
This incarnation, in the beginning, was a
fish when we were fishes; when we were tortoises,

131
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:04,809
it was a tortoise; when we were reptiles,
it was a tortoise; when we were quadrupeds,

132
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:10,539
it was a boar.

133
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:27,100
Then, later on, it became half man and half
lion.

134
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:37,559
Then it became a small man, a short man.

135
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:46,330
Then it became the very strong man – Parashurama.

136
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,149
Then he came as Shri Rama.

137
00:24:52,149 --> 00:25:03,659
At his completion, he came as Shri Krishna.

138
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:21,139
Now this center which has got the innocence,
the incarnation of the innocence, the embodiment

139
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:36,419
of innocence, was Shri Ganesh.

140
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:50,049
This Shri Ganesh incarnated on this Earth
as the only Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ.

141
00:25:50,049 --> 00:26:05,510
And He is going to reincarnate again with
eleven powers to destroy.

142
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:20,480
Apart from that, there is a third type of
incarnation which works in this gap to sustain

143
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
us.

144
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:31,289
These are ten Primordial Masters, the Adi
Gurus.

145
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:46,110
These people incarnated on this Earth to give
us our sustenance, our religion, as they call

146
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,649
it.

147
00:26:47,649 --> 00:27:03,679
They gave us those ten religions, or sustenance,
which is important for a human being.

148
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:13,539
This principle of primordial masters incarnated
as Abraham, as Moses, as Mohammad Sahab, as

149
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:23,779
Janaka, as Nanaka, as Socrates and, till recently,
the one who is no more now, is Shirdi Sainath.

150
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:53,330
Now, these people are incarnations of one
principle, that is 

151
00:27:53,330 --> 00:28:02,690
the Primordial Master.

152
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:10,269
The energy, or the power with which they work,
is either a sister or a daughter, is a very

153
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:14,239
pure relationship.

154
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:34,940
If you read their teachings, you will find
they are saying the same things because they

155
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,499
were worried about our sustenance.

156
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:51,659
But Christ talked about our evolution, our
resurrection.

157
00:28:51,659 --> 00:29:02,519
Krishna, in his incarnation, said that divine
life cannot be destroyed.

158
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:22,429
The life of Christ, or the body of Christ,
was made of this divine power, absolute.

159
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:38,299
In one of the very old scriptures, Devi Bhagawat
from India, Christ is described as Mahavishnu.

160
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:54,850
He is described as first being an egg; that’s
why on an Easter we give eggs.

161
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,789
But Christians can’t explain why they give
eggs.

162
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:07,350
They also cannot explain why he was called
Christ and Jesus.

163
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:19,100
When He talks of His father, it is Krishna
He is talking about.

164
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:29,240
It is said in the Devi Bhagawat, Krishna put
His Son even above Him.

165
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:42,710
And He gave Him such powers that He would
be the support of the whole universe.

166
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:52,309
As an Indian, if you have read about Indian
mythology, you will have much more respect

167
00:30:52,309 --> 00:31:08,970
for Christ and His Mother, who was nothing
else but the Primordial Mother.

168
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:16,809
Because India was a slave for 300 years and
English became the main language, nobody tried

169
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:23,340
to translate anything about Indian things.

170
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:44,850
Moreover, the Western people were more interested
in sexology and all dirty things of India.

171
00:31:44,850 --> 00:32:01,749
It is like entering into a house from the
gutters of the backdoor.

172
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:11,570
Even now the way they are interested in all
these dirty things is most amazing for Indians.

173
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:27,129
We went to Nepal with my husband and children
and we never noticed any erotic things.

174
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:32,720
But I had a Swiss disciple in Nepal.

175
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:53,070
When I went again to Nepal, he told me that
it was full of erotics at the top of the temples.

176
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,830
And all the Japanese and all such people were
busy with zoom lenses watching all that with

177
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,889
such minute details.

178
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:09,070
I didn’t know what was there to watch.

179
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:27,080
It is difficult to understand this mind which
takes you to these nonsensical things.

180
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,639
If you have to evaluate a person, you must
know how far spiritually he has gone and not

181
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:47,989
how much he has debased himself, not by that.

182
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:53,220
How much he has mastered his lust and greed
is to be seen and not how much he has enslaved

183
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:06,909
himself of these things.

184
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:21,589
If a person wants comfort and cannot live
without comfort, he is not a spiritual man.

185
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,460
He can live in comfort or discomfort, it makes
no difference to him because he lives with

186
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:36,220
his Spirit.

187
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:45,289
Such a person is a king; nothing can dominate
such a person, nobody can capture such a person

188
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:52,889
or can make a parasite out of him.

189
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:59,390
If one understands that spiritual life gives
you the mastery of your being, then you would

190
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:15,650
understand that those people who roam about
as gurus are just parasites.

191
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:35,410
Now, these incarnations who came on this Earth
were manifesting the different aspects of

192
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:41,920
God.

193
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:53,430
Because God is Compassion, He is Love, He
is your Father and He is Almighty.

194
00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:03,150
He wants to bestow all His blessings upon
you and He wants to enlighten your awareness.

195
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:21,190
For that He sends His own emissaries 
to guide you, to rise above the shackles of

196
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:32,930
matter, the mind, the emotions and spiritual
mistakes.

197
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:48,930
For that, God has already placed a power there.

198
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:57,119
Many people have talked about this and have
written big books of this kind.

199
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:07,369
By reading books you cannot get the awakening
of this Kundalini.

200
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:18,480
It is a germinating force within us.

201
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,859
It is a living force.

202
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:26,250
You cannot germinate a seed by reading books.

203
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,310
You have to have the Mother Earth to germinate.

204
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:37,850
In the same way, to raise this Kundalini,
you need a person who is the mother of this

205
00:37:37,850 --> 00:38:00,240
Kundalini, or who is the master of this art,
who is compassion, who is Love, who is holy,

206
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,190
who is righteous.

207
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:16,670
But not a person who leads a funny life, a
guru having seven women around, cannot be

208
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,170
a master of Kundalini.

209
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:32,799
A man who takes money from you cannot raise
your Kundalini.

210
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:39,539
A man who takes money from you has no self-respect.

211
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:45,349
He cannot even talk of Kundalini.

212
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:51,470
Such a person has to be higher than you.

213
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,310
In that, he is humbler than you.

214
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:10,869
He is full of love and patience and understanding;
not of your purse, but of your beauty; not

215
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:17,730
of your bank balance and your position, but
your position within.

216
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:34,780
If you find somebody coming with a circus,
why should you be impressed by such a man?

217
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,890
All important things, all vital things are
extremely simple.

218
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:47,869
For example your own breathing.

219
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:53,430
Supposing for your breathing if you have to
read books and analyze it, will you breathe?

220
00:39:53,430 --> 00:40:03,740
For that, you don’t have to read any books.

221
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,729
It is spontaneous.

222
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:13,520
All your evolution has been spontaneous.

223
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:24,070
You got your body, face, nose, eyes, this
human being, all for nothing.

224
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:30,900
What did you do to get that?

225
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:41,210
Its all given as a blessing to you because
God wants his children to get all his blessings

226
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,970
and all his powers.

227
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:55,440
But in his freedom, man has become so egoistical
that he is also denying God.

228
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:19,349
It’s alright, it’s just the same as blind
faith, just the same as denial of God.

229
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:28,859
Even the people who believe in God, so-called,
what have they achieved?

230
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:35,890
That is the reason why people now are going
to the other extreme of denying God.

231
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:47,420
For example, Algeria, where the people have
been under French regime and who believed

232
00:41:47,420 --> 00:42:03,839
in God and everything, but the young people
became communists.

233
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,630
Because the young people do not believe in
the old people who are blindly following some

234
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,230
sort of an organization of God.

235
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:34,359
Because they are so mythical; they have no
proof of God and they are so fanatic.

236
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,670
Fanaticism is a disease.

237
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,690
It has nothing to do with God.

238
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:51,359
That’s one extreme and another extreme is
denial of God.

239
00:42:51,359 --> 00:43:01,950
When you are in the center you can find God.

240
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:17,970
A boy from Algeria came and he got his realization
in London with me.

241
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:24,240
He went and told the young people in Algeria
that, “No, there is God, but we have to

242
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:34,559
find him within ourselves."

243
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,859
He gave realization to five hundred young
boys.

244
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:50,860
With self-realization, your life is completely
transformed.

245
00:43:50,860 --> 00:44:02,190
We have here about fifty-percent of people
are realized souls.

246
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,829
After realization, the power starts flowing
from your hands.

247
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:23,829
This is the power of your Spirit and you can
use it and verify it.

248
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,819
The diseases like cancer cannot be cured without
self-realization.

249
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:39,849
We 
have cured many cancer patients.

250
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:49,940
I have even cured the President of India of
lung cancer.

251
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,900
You may write to him and find out.

252
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:08,000
But it is very easy to approach a President
in India if you’re a saint.

253
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,789
They respect you as a saint.

254
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:19,160
For example, the President of India would
stand up for me, though I am an Indian citizen.

255
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:34,410
And he would not sit down till I have sat
down.

256
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:41,319
But in the West, people do not stand even
for their own father.

257
00:45:41,319 --> 00:46:00,369
The ego makes a person so naive about spirituality
and anybody who comes to pamper your ego,

258
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,130
you accept it.

259
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:11,450
[Shri Mataji speaks to a seeker]: Are you
taping my lecture?

260
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,450
That’s not allowed?

261
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,440
It’s alright?

262
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,560
… The organization, they say it should not
be taped, but it’s alright, because it has

263
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:31,850
a little problem.

264
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:45,530
There is a protocol about this.

265
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:53,990
Only thing is for realized souls we allow,
but not to non-realized souls because if you

266
00:46:53,990 --> 00:47:04,200
insult it, it will have an effect on you.

267
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:31,059
Otherwise there is no harm in recording me.

268
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:43,280
There is no enterprise going on here, but
there is a protocol.

269
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:58,549
It’s alright, you can tape it because, for
example, my photograph has vibrations.

270
00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:06,650
If you put my photograph somewhere else it
is not alright, then you fall from the grace.

271
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,650
It should not be done.

272
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:26,529
You understand my point?

273
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:33,640
Because it is a holy thing.

274
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:50,799
Cancer and other such diseases can be cured
through self-realization as a by-product 

275
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:55,490
but it is not the main job of Sahaja Yoga.

276
00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:03,190
It is just a by-product.

277
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,410
Like when God has to be realized within you,
is to be established in your temple.

278
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:18,630
Your temple has to be cleansed.

279
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:43,119
If you do not get your realization, then there
is no need to worry about it.

280
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:50,609
You will get it, eventually and you must get
it.

281
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:58,220
This is your right to have it and you must
assert your right.

282
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,840
You cannot live without it.

283
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,130
If you won’t take in this life, you will
be born again and ask for the same.

284
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,780
Why not short-circuit it?

285
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:28,230
I said it is the easiest thing to do but very
difficult for human beings to be easy.

286
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:38,460
They can eat their food like this, but they
want to eat the other way round.

287
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:50,460
It is like a 
second birth of a bird.

288
00:50:50,460 --> 00:51:03,390
You become like an egg by that covering 
and when Kundalini pierces through, She breaks

289
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:14,930
the shell here 
and you become a new person with a new awareness

290
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:21,670
of collective consciousness.

291
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,039
You become, you actualize.

292
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:30,260
It is not just brainwashing.

293
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,900
You just can feel it.

294
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:44,170
But even if you are born as a human being
and again you will live with wolves, you may

295
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,950
behave like wolves.

296
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:56,180
Because you must mature like human beings
to begin with.

297
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:02,010
In the same way, you have to mature like a
self-realized person.

298
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:16,220
Like a seed can germinate but it has to be
looked after till it completely becomes an

299
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,180
independent tree.

300
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:30,619
This is your own power within you.

301
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:44,710
She is your mother and she has no other child;
she knows everything about you; she loves

302
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:53,210
you and she wants you to have your self-realization.

303
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,460
She is not going to give you any trouble.

304
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:06,589
At the time of your birth, she takes all the
troubles herself.

305
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:13,630
It is a very smooth affair.

306
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:24,680
At the first outset, it rushes very fast up
there and you became one with the all-pervading

307
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:32,700
power.

308
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:39,100
You start feeling your own centers and the
centers of others.

309
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,990
I have shown here.

310
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:45,870
All your centers are enlightened – seven
of them.

311
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:54,579
For example, this is the center of Heart.

312
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:59,510
If you place your hands towards me like this
and if you find this one burning (pointing

313
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,170
to her little finger), that means there is
some pressure on your heart.

314
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:20,720
Like that, one can diagnose any disease that
you are suffering from.

315
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:28,030
All these decodings could be done through
Sahaja Yoga.

316
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:35,300
All this knowledge is available free.

317
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:50,200
So that you enjoy your self thoroughly and
you feel yourself and others, give realization

318
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:59,529
to others and enjoy the being.

319
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:07,789
First time the human beings enjoy other human
beings as if the fragrance from the flower

320
00:55:07,789 --> 00:55:17,099
is enjoying the flower.

321
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:26,319
First time after realization, you can repay
back 

322
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,319
the nature which you have used.

323
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:40,339
For example, if you give your vibrations to
a tree, which is sick, it will improve, it

324
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:44,920
will give more fruits, much more fruits.

325
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:55,210
If you give vibrations to your wheat fields
and paddy fields, you will have plenty of

326
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:59,410
foods.

327
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,490
You can even vibrate this water and give it
to somebody and the person will feel perfectly

328
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:11,829
alright in his stomach.

329
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:26,240
When you become subtle, you can enter into
the subtle of the elements.

330
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,910
By entering into the subtle you can use them
for your own purpose.

331
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:41,980
Moreover, when you are in connection with
the all-pervading power, there is a complete

332
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:54,190
telecommunication working.

333
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:00,549
Sitting here, you can know what is the matter
with another person who is thousands of miles

334
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:07,000
away from you.

335
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,410
You can also cure that person.

336
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:20,910
These children can find out if a particular
person, who is dead or living, is realized

337
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,279
or not?

338
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:31,950
For example in England, there is a place called
Stonehenge and the people have different theories

339
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,850
about it.

340
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:46,829
Like blind finding something and they are
quarreling about it.

341
00:57:46,829 --> 00:58:00,240
Stonehenge is a miracle of the Mother Earth;
it is Mother Earth who has created those stones.

342
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:13,220
They have a particular pattern by which they
emit vibrations.

343
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:23,750
These vibrations are there to save London
from getting drowned into materialism.

344
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:28,009
The poor Mother Earth has to do all these
things.

345
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:36,579
In the Ten Commandments, it is said that you
shall not reproduce anything that is created

346
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:56,490
by the Mother Earth or by the sky and worship
it.

347
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:00,640
What is produced by the Mother Earth?

348
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,059
These things which give you vibrations.

349
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:10,900
In India, we have many places like these.

350
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:16,870
And we have so many saints who have found
them out.

351
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:29,510
The province from where I come there are eight
which represent the innocence.

352
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:35,309
The stones that have come up are not touched
by human beings but they look exactly like

353
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,480
Shri Ganesh.

354
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:45,240
There are 12 Jyotirlingas which represent
the heart, the Spirit.

355
00:59:45,240 --> 01:00:00,180
In Amarnath, in the Himalayas, there is a
place in a cave where the water falls down

356
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:09,269
and at a particular time, lunar date, the
thing becomes a complete linga.

357
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:29,740
In the Himalayas, one of the ranges of Himalayas,
beyond the Kulu Valley, in the temple of Amarnath,

358
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,950
there is a drop coming from the ceiling of
a cave.

359
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,500
It forms a complete Linga.

360
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:58,309
At that date, it is completed and it gives
vibrations.

361
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:10,960
We have a center in a place known as Musselwadi
in India.

362
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:23,490
They told me a story about a bund that was
built across 

363
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:27,940
a lake.

364
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:40,890
Bund should be straight, but at a point, it
went like that and again like that with a

365
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,040
circular movement.

366
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,980
I asked them what is the reason?

367
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:53,630
So they told me, about a hundred years back,
an English engineer had come to build this

368
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,960
barrage.

369
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:14,579
This, he wrote, was a 
very unique phenomenon.

370
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:19,609
He said that he tried to build a wall on that
part but he could not raise it.

371
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:32,950
Every night it used to fall back.

372
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:42,700
Even the horses would refuse to go near that
to put the mud over that.

373
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:56,190
And he could not understand it, so he had
to cross that point in a circular way.

374
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,609
I went and saw that place.

375
01:02:57,609 --> 01:03:09,190
It was all vibrating and giving the vibrations
as they would come from this center called

376
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:12,029
as Sahasrara.

377
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:18,529
The whole atmosphere was filled with that.

378
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:28,050
Once I went to Kashmir with my husband and
I had gone just for a drive with him a little

379
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:38,660
further away from the city.

380
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:44,730
And I felt tremendous vibrations in that area
and I asked the driver if there was any temple

381
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,369
or anything here?

382
01:03:47,369 --> 01:04:01,700
He said that it is all wilderness so I asked
him to go in the direction from where the

383
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:13,270
vibrations were coming.

384
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:27,010
When we reached a particular area, we found
some Muslim houses were settled there.

385
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:39,960
They told us that there is one hair of Mohammad
Sahab kept in that mosque, known as Hazrat

386
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Ekbal.

387
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,250
(Ekbal means one hair.

388
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:48,249
Hazrat means respect.)

389
01:04:48,249 --> 01:05:04,700
But for that hair, these useless people there
fought among themselves and killed each other.

390
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,460
Such shameless people they are.

391
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:15,789
They do not understand the protocol of that
hair.

392
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:20,240
They don’t understand the vibrations.

393
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:28,749
For example in Paris, the statue of Mary in
Notre Dame is extremely vibrating.

394
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:35,869
Imagine, a man committed suicide from such
a beautiful holy place.

395
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:42,390
What a shame.

396
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:46,420
It is an insult of the deities.

397
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,730
How will he understand?

398
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,559
Because he is not a realized soul.

399
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:58,830
That is why they crucified Christ.

400
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:04,589
They could not understand him and they did
not want to understand.

401
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:12,630
Today I am faced with intellectuals.

402
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:16,430
Intellectuals move like this, come like this,
go like this, come like this, go like this,

403
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:21,760
come like this – finished.

404
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,640
They are a little bit this way.

405
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,749
The other day one man told me that Hitler
was also God.

406
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:43,549
I asked him, ”Who told you that?”

407
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:46,660
He said that I believe that way.

408
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:52,609
I asked him, ”Who is this I who believes
and on what premises?”

409
01:06:52,609 --> 01:07:01,869
He could not answer that question.

410
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:10,890
If you can feel the vibrations of that horrid
Hitler you would know who he was.

411
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:14,190
He was a demon.

412
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:24,809
He not only destroyed people but he destroyed
all 

413
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:27,840
the values of sustenance.

414
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:33,630
He disturbed the sense of security so much
in human beings that today we find all these

415
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:46,440
kinds of problems in the West.

416
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,440
How can you call a demon a God?

417
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,579
From what intellectual angle?

418
01:07:52,579 --> 01:08:04,430
I do not know how one can see upside down
things with your intellect?

419
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:15,430
There is another guru in India who is teaching
people how to use sex to go to God.

420
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:24,670
Have you forgotten Christ?

421
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:31,139
He said, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,”
was the commandment, but I say, “Thou shalt

422
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:49,250
not have adulterous eyes,” because the eyes
are possessed when you do that.

423
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:59,330
It’s a joyless effort, so tiring and so
boring.

424
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:03,710
It has no meaning.

425
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:09,150
It fritters away your energy completely.

426
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:20,080
When will you enjoy yourself with all the
beauty of Paris?

427
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:26,070
I find people just going like this.

428
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:36,170
They have no time to enjoy beauty.

429
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:45,339
They have no sensitivity to suck that beauty.

430
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:59,179
[UNCLEAR] But because of these atmospheres
and these great people writing books, you

431
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:10,170
are lost in the opinion of others.

432
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:13,690
You are not to be found.

433
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:19,420
What you say is somebody else’s opinion.

434
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:25,139
You have known your own experience.

435
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:31,940
Why should you listen to anybody else?

436
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,440
Form your own opinion.

437
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,070
But where are you?

438
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:41,640
You are lost in the crowd.

439
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:49,030
That’s why get your realization.

440
01:10:49,030 --> 01:11:04,250
That is your absolute and by that absolute
you will know that this is all relative.

441
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:12,020
Then only you will get answers to all your
absolute questions.

442
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:22,440
With this Yoga, with this communion, you become
one with that Truth.

443
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:46,800
It’s like a connection of a very beautifully
built computer.

444
01:11:46,800 --> 01:12:02,760
Now this computer is very nicely made in thousands
of years and a rapport is established that

445
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,270
you can ask any question.

446
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,800
You can ask the question, “Is there God?”

447
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,330
T this question you will start getting lots
of vibrations.

448
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:37,300
But there are another type of things which
are also called by negative people as vibrations.

449
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:41,130
One should not confuse.

450
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:47,270
If you get possessed, also, you start shaking.

451
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:52,400
You’ll get convulsions.

452
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,050
People pay thousands of pounds to get convulsions.

453
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:04,870
We had here some people from TM, some from
others, Rajneesh and this and that.

454
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:18,739
They all have paid thousands of rupees just
to get convulsions.

455
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:28,820
Some of them were lunatics and some of them
were epileptics.

456
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:38,410
So many people like this are dying on the
streets with epilepsy.

457
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:45,340
You must know if you have got your own powers.

458
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:58,190
If you are manifesting your own power, if
you can feel your own chakras (centers), that’s

459
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:08,840
your Self, and you must feel the chakras of
others.

460
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:21,270
You must improve in your health, in your wealth
and in your temperament.

461
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:34,920
The complete priorities must change and you
should be a transformed personality.

462
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:53,550
Otherwise people pay them for convulsions
or for epilepsy, or for getting sick and headaches?

463
01:14:53,550 --> 01:15:04,610
Most of these people have a terrible headache
here, ending up in lunatic asylum.

464
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:08,800
But they’re not telling each other because
some mafia is going on; nobody knows what

465
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:16,800
is going wrong with the others.

466
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,630
You are told to keep complete secret.

467
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:38,140
So that you do not know how far you are rottened
and a competition is set in secretly.

468
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:44,260
Some people are saying they are teaching flying.

469
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:49,750
How can you believe with your intelligence
such nonsense?

470
01:15:49,750 --> 01:16:00,409
With your evolution are you going to be become
birds now and then frogs?

471
01:16:00,409 --> 01:16:14,179
You have to become something else which is
described in all the scriptures, supported

472
01:16:14,179 --> 01:16:20,360
by all the incarnations and the prophets.

473
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,370
Imagine, some people started flying.

474
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,860
What would happen?

475
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:33,850
God, will He make you such absurd things?

476
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:37,420
Why do you want to fly?

477
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:44,320
I just can’t understand?

478
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:53,760
Some scientists came from America to see me,
specially, because they wanted to fly in the

479
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,880
air.

480
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,110
They wanted to leave their body and go somewhere
else.

481
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:09,409
I told them, You have already landed on the
moon.

482
01:17:09,409 --> 01:17:13,810
Why do you want to fly?”

483
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:25,500
They said, ”Because Russia is doing that."

484
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:32,929
I said, ”Which Russian is flying?”

485
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:37,320
They said, ”They are doing parapsychology
and ESP."

486
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,810
I said, ”That is all possession of the spirits.

487
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:47,870
Do you want domination of the spirits?”

488
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:56,920
They said, ”We want to fly."

489
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:03,170
But I said, ”You will be enslaved by those
spirits."

490
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:12,710
They said, ”Still we want to do it because
Russia is doing it."

491
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:21,420
I said, ”If Russia is going to hell, will
you go to hell, also?”

492
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:29,690
Surprisingly, they said, ”Yes."

493
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:34,710
I said, ”Then go faster there."

494
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:51,820
I can’t understand these human beings, intelligent
people.

495
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,540
Intelligence is not wisdom.

496
01:18:54,540 --> 01:19:10,210
When wisdom is enlightened, then you become
complete.

497
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:20,610
Because this power controls the whole universe.

498
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:25,350
It is the complete knowledge.

499
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:32,130
It is the bliss.

500
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:39,900
It is the attention of God which is completely
enlightened.

501
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:52,940
We have to enter into the kingdom of God and
not to waste our life like this.

502
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:59,770
This is very fantastic.

503
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:05,110
People cannot believe that you cannot pay
for your realization.

504
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:17,580
We can’t believe we can get anything without
paying.

505
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:24,280
But how can you pay for your realization?

506
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,960
That is an insult, a debasement.

507
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:43,909
It is a very different thing I am telling
you about, which cannot be sold, which just

508
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:44,909
permeates.

509
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:51,560
It permeates everywhere.

510
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,250
It wants to be shared by everyone.

511
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:14,520
It wants to elevate everyone, to that height
where you are suddenly shot off into the space,

512
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:23,480
where you become the master of yourself and
one with God.

513
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:32,020
I think for today I have spoken quite a lot
and there are so many things to be said on

514
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:39,810
this subject.

515
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:52,250
We must first have the experience to understand
what I am saying.

516
01:21:52,250 --> 01:22:03,580
Then use your vibrations on others to see
how you work it out.

517
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:17,849
If somebody gives me, say, French francs and
I don’t use them, how will I know their

518
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:19,170
value?

519
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:30,670
And then establish it within yourself and
enjoy your dignity.

520
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:39,719
Till this light is not enlightened it is seeking.

521
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:47,429
But once it is enlightened it is just giving
light.

522
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:53,230
The position changes from that to this.

523
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:58,840
Then you become the giver.

524
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:06,490
It is that simple and innate within you.

525
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:12,170
The time has come for this.

526
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:20,010
En masse evolution has started in India.

527
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:29,380
Even in England there are thousands who have
got realization.

528
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:34,900
I have to see now how far Paris is going to
come up.

529
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:41,440
This is the first time I am here.

530
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:58,960
Only through your wisdom and understanding
you can expedite this evolution 

531
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,010
and transform the whole world into a new age.

532
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:09,750
The time is short.

533
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:17,730
As I told you Christ is going to come back
with His eleven destructive forces.

534
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:30,400
He is going to destroy all that is useless.

535
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,290
This is your last judgement.

536
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:40,599
Kundalini awakening is the way you are going
to be judged.

537
01:24:40,599 --> 01:24:52,840
The last judgment has started; you just face
it.

538
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,400
All grace is with you.

539
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:04,210
I’ll work very hard but you must also have
determination.

540
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,929
We all have to work hard and share the duty.

541
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:08,929
May God Bless you.

542
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:31,700
(To a Sahaja Yogi) Can you ask them to take
out the shoes and put both their feet on the

543
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,700
ground?

544
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:45,880
Christ’s Mother was the embodiment of that
incarnation.

545
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:54,530
But She was kept completely in the dark because
Christ did not want that Her protocol should

546
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:59,050
be disturbed.

547
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:16,260
If anybody had troubled Her, He would come
down on this Earth with eleven destructive

548
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,360
powers.

549
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:26,260
But He wore his cross because He had to show
that resurrection is the aim of life.

550
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:36,350
Put your hands like this.

551
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:42,409
Straight like this.

552
01:26:42,409 --> 01:26:43,730
Now ask them to close their eyes
