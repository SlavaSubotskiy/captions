1
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,423
Its very interesting the way you have found out

2
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:34,757
today is the real Guru Purnima.

3
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,757
The Purnima is the day when the moon is full.

4
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,840
I knew this but for Sahaja Yogis we have to arrange

5
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:49,132
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday,Saturday, Sunday.

6
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:54,340
Whenever either it is on the date or not we have to arrange

7
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:55,257
so it in that case,

8
00:00:55,465 --> 00:01:04,757
this time it was I think two days before So it doesn't matter,

9
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,049
after all, moon is there for us and we are for moon,

10
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,257
so it can't be some thing that would have very wrong in it.

11
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:29,757
I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle.

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,049
And the guru principle,

13
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:38,257
we have seen people who came on this Earth

14
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,257
they were all mostly born realised

15
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:45,840
actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone

16
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,340
it's a very big difference.

17
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:55,257
They were all born as realised souls and they  became Sufis

18
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,257
and they are called by different names,

19
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:04,465
but they were not given self realisation, they had it

20
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,840
and because of their self realisation as they had,

21
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,340
they have so much of knowledge

22
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,965
and that is  what they try to impart to people.

23
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:21,840
They knew all about Chakras everything they knew,

24
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:28,840
somehow, must be in their past life achievements that they knew it,

25
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:37,049
perhaps some of them were disciples of  other very great people.

26
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:41,381
I don't know how they had full ideas to

27
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:46,257
what is self realisation is

28
00:02:46,548 --> 00:02:50,882
what do we achieve after self realisation .

29
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:55,965
Now the only person, I think, Mohammed Sahib, is the one

30
00:02:56,257 --> 00:03:01,673
who has talked about Miraj is the ascent

31
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:06,257
Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini.

32
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,465
Of course in India they did talked about it,

33
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:13,257
but in any other country they didn't say it so clearly

34
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,965
that there is something called Miraj.

35
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:19,673
And, not only that He talked of Miraj

36
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:27,673
but also he talked of the resurrection time

37
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:30,257
when your hands will speak.

38
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,882
Two things He said,

39
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,590
first that your hands will speak

40
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,090
when you will get your realisation .

41
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:43,673
It's a very great thing to say

42
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:48,465
because that is how you can ascertain and you can be sure

43
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:51,465
that you got your realisation.

44
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,757
That's the sign He gave,

45
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,590
and the second thing He talked about Miraj

46
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:01,798
and the white horse He said was nothing  but the Kundalini,

47
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:07,174
He didn't used the word Kundalini but He said it's a white horse.

48
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:13,299
So He is the one who knew what should happen to the

49
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,299
people when they got their self realisation.

50
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:19,798
That's the great revelation to all of you

51
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,798
and of such a help to Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,381
You are all realised souls

53
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:30,590
because you can feel the vibrations one thing,

54
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:36,882
and secondly how you have become He explained it very clearly.

55
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:41,299
We have so many saints in India, so many of them,

56
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:45,673
one better than the other and whatever they talked,

57
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:51,007
whatever they say, is so remarkable... is so remarkable.

58
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:58,506
But actually, human beings, I  think we are very dumb,

59
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,174
that they never realised that we have so many saints here.

60
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:08,007
Even in Turkey we had Sufis where it's a Sunni religion,

61
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,299
there too, we had so many Sufis

62
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,299
all over the world. We had realised souls,

63
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,506
they were not incarnations, but they were born realised souls.

64
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:27,715
So you see their explanation and everything is very good  because

65
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:31,381
they were human beings and what ever they said

66
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:37,215
was very much good for human beings to understand.

67
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:39,590
Because an incarnation said something,

68
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,715
it is something from the beyond

69
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:45,715
and this new,

70
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:51,798
I should say, advice of the people who were

71
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,798
really human beings and had become realised souls and

72
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:02,215
how they have talked about the various things is very remarkable.

73
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,923
Firstly most of them were poets

74
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:10,590
and this, we had Kabir in India,

75
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,798
we don't know how he was born,

76
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,007
where he was from, who were his parents,

77
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,299
it's absolutely not known,

78
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:24,090
despite that you can only make out from their poetry that

79
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:27,007
he was the great great Sahaj Yogi,

80
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,090
and how he have described things very interesting.

81
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:35,715
He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry

82
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:37,798
and he talked about it.

83
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:41,007
He didn't belong to any religion, as such,

84
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:46,132
when he died there was a fight between Hindus and Muslims :

85
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:50,631
what should we do with his body.

86
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:55,923
And they say when they had lifted the sheet

87
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,798
they found flowers, two types of flower one for Hindus

88
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:04,715
and one for Muslims,

89
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,132
so that's how he have solved the problems

90
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:10,299
of this stupid fight people were having.

91
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:16,798
In Sahaj Yoga we are not belonging to any such stupid religion,

92
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:21,215
we belongs to one religion that is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma

93
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,299
and all the stupidity of all these religions

94
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:26,506
we should really throw away

95
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,923
because, what you just see now today

96
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,840
every where, every religious group is fighting each other,

97
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,506
beating each other, finishing each other,

98
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,132
is not the way a religious person should be like that

99
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,840
but  they are killing each other.

100
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,007
I mean, all kind of  horrible things they are doing,

101
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:53,132
unbelievable how they can do that, such cruelty.

102
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:57,631
And first thing is for a yogi,

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,132
or for a saint, cruelty is  absolutely not  there,

104
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:08,215
they will sacrifice their lives, they will do any thing,

105
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,715
but they will not be cruel to any other person.

106
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:15,631
Now, those who in the name of God and in the religion are cruel

107
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:20,299
are actually not at all by  any chances religious people.

108
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:24,715
So this is what the perversion of religion is,

109
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:28,548
we all should understand, if we belong to Sahaj Yoga

110
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,548
then for us kindness, sweetness, compassion and love

111
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,049
is the main qualities we should have

112
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:42,257
and if  you don't have that, then we are not Sahaj Yogis.

113
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,631
So we are a different clan,

114
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:51,257
I should say, a  different personalities,

115
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,631
who are really realised souls,

116
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,049
who are above all these nonsensical ideas

117
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,340
and who have vibrations.

118
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:05,631
But, as I said, that now you must spread it

119
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:08,049
because I have come on this Earth

120
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,840
just for people to get their emancipation,

121
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,132
get their realisation

122
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,340
and unless and until all the people

123
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:23,132
who believe in their emancipation get it, I won't be happy.

124
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:24,965
There are many people who do believe

125
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,757
but not yet got their realisation,

126
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,965
so you have to work and you will be amazed

127
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:35,757
you will find people who are very anxious to get their realisation.

128
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,965
It will work out on this Guru Purnima day,

129
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:41,757
it is a very auspicious day.

130
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,548
I bless you with a special power

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,257
that you can give realisation to other.

132
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:51,257
Don't get involved in your own problems,

133
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,757
that's not important, that will all be solved.

134
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,049
Mostly what I got letters about is their own personal problems

135
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,174
or some sort  of other problems.

136
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:05,174
What you should do is to see what is your problem within you

137
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:10,257
what is happening within you, why we are having a problem within,

138
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:16,340
what is our duty, why we have got  our self realisation,

139
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:20,548
why we   have got this wealth of spirituality

140
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:23,049
and what should we do with it.

141
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,257
I tell you really think about it every day,

142
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:31,965
even for half an hour, you will realise that

143
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,882
you are very well equipped people.

144
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:41,381
Saints have done so much, they have written so many things

145
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,882
they have fought the people, they did everything.

146
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:45,757
You don't have to do anything like that,

147
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:49,174
but one thing is that you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

148
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:55,673
Even now Sahaj Yoga is not so much accepted everywhere,

149
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,882
people don't know about it,

150
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:01,757
it's surprising while all kinds of horrible gurus

151
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,049
are very well known.

152
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:06,757
So we have to do it by our behaviour,

153
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,174
by our understanding, by our whole life, people should say

154
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,090
that these are something rare people and different people.

155
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:22,257
I am happy today is another day of Guru Purnima

156
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,381
which is a very auspicious day

157
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,590
and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you

158
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,590
because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate,

159
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:39,090
that you all are capable of being Gurus.

160
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:40,965
You have to become that,

161
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:45,381
becoming is important, in Sahaj Yoga becoming is important,

162
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:48,590
all other things are really of no use.

163
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:52,965
You have to become, specially ladies are shy I think.

164
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,381
They can do a lot and they should work it out,

165
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:01,090
they are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy?

166
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,882
They are very shy ladies and

167
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:12,174
they just don't get into the whole working of  Sahaj Yoga,

168
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,882
You should. If the ladies start talking about it,

169
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:18,174
I think it will work much faster.

170
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:21,965
And I bless you all to do this work,

171
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,381
which was left half done by the Saints,

172
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,882
it's your duty to complete it .

173
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,673
May God Bless You.
