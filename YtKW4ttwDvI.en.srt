1
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:28,255
Shri Mataji: Is it for the loudspeaker?
Yes.

2
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,594
We can wait for some time more to organize.

3
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:53,625
It is so unfortunate that it was not
published in the newspaper properly,

4
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:58,699
that day – it’s very unfortunate.

5
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:38,261
Yogi: Excuse me Mother, I think to get
this microphone a little closer to you.

6
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:41,175
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogi: Do You want to get
this a little closer to You?

7
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,893
Shri Mataji: I’ll have it in My hand.
Yogi: You’ll take this in Your hand?

8
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:47,014
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Yogi: Okay.

9
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,268
Shri Mataji: Then that won’t slip out,
you know. Yogi: Ah, okay.

10
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:06,042
That’s ok, this. This is the one…

11
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,815
When we say in the newspaper or
in an advertisement

12
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:10,280
that you come to such and such hall
for your Self-realization,

13
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,839
I don’t know what people think about it.

14
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:24,799
Perhaps they think that it is another
hocus-pocus

15
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,978
or some sort of a cult or some
money-making proposition.

16
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,707
But there are some who may not think
that way,

17
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:51,280
but they want to have their Self-realization
and they come here.

18
00:04:52,046 --> 00:05:00,759
But one must understand that the attitude
we should have towards our Self

19
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,239
has to be really very earnest. To raise
your Kundalini is not so difficult

20
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:18,608
and to give you so-called realization
also not difficult,

21
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:23,604
in the sense that you can feel the cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost

22
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:29,160
coming out of the fontanel bone area,
you can get your baptism.

23
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:34,118
But I call it "so-called"

24
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:41,271
because the journey later is the difficult
thing, you see.

25
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:50,482
If the attitude is not earnest, then you
just lose it in no time.

26
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:59,079
So where the people are very ego-oriented -
I should say, convex personality is there -

27
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,734
it is even difficult to give realization
to begin with,

28
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:08,056
and even if you give realization,
to maintain it

29
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:14,153
and to make them grow is even more
difficult, much more difficult.

30
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,735
Now sometimes Sahaja Yogis ask Me,
“Mother, how is it that in India

31
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:22,839
You may give realization to thousands
and they all stick on,

32
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,920
while here when You give realization
to people

33
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,720
they just come and go away, are all wasted
as described

34
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:40,317
in the parable of Christ of the seeds, that
some seeds just were lost on the rocks?”

35
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:43,119
So why it happens here?

36
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:50,441
I would not blame them, but I would say
that they have had no knowledge

37
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:56,873
what Self-realization is, how difficult
it is.

38
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,559
If you read Patanjali’s “Yogashastra”
you’ll be surprised

39
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:11,519
how they were taught how to lead a good,
righteous life after marriage;

40
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,653
what was the relationship of a husband
and wife;

41
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:23,714
what was rhythm of sex life; how they
should treat their children;

42
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:29,319
how to develop their attention towards God
every day.

43
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,839
All these things are absolutely missing
from the lives of people

44
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,871
who have turned their backs to God.

45
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,650
Now, whatever you may try to turn
your backs to God or to your Self,

46
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:54,999
to your Spirit, it exists and it asserts
its own existence in you. It does.

47
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,028
Even if you try to defy it and deny it,
it comes up,

48
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,039
and so people are seeking and seeking.

49
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,879
The tragedy of the whole thing is that very
great seekers are born in the West

50
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,173
where people have no knowledge what is
Self-realization

51
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:22,759
and what one has to do to achieve it and
what a great blessing it is to have it.

52
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,455
This is the biggest problem we face
all over and now as I am going to America

53
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:31,369
I also dread the same problem there.

54
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,959
Now the thing is, people have full idea
as to the value of a diamond.

55
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,479
They know if the diamond weighs so many
carats, it means this.

56
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,799
If it is flawless, it means this. If it is
purest blue then it means this.

57
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,559
But they don’t know the value of their
spiritual life;

58
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,320
they don’t know what it is to be spiritual.
Under these circumstances, naturally,

59
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,719
what happens that when even they get
Self-realization

60
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,559
they cannot stick on to Sahaja Yoga and
go further with it.

61
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,079
Not that they lack in quality. I would say
it is not so.

62
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,800
I would not say that they are the people
who are good for nothing,

63
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,193
they are not good for spiritual life.
So all the Sahaja Yogis must have

64
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:27,439
a very compassionate and understanding
attitude towards them,

65
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,719
that when they come to you they have
no knowledge about it.

66
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,000
They are not trained that way. They are
not taught that way.

67
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,152
I wish the people in the countries where
they have lost themselves

68
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:45,880
in the material gains should again read
some of these books into details

69
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,239
and try to find out what kind of life human
beings were supposed to lead

70
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,399
and what kind of life we are leading now.

71
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,759
Now the word there is yama niyama, is a word
in the Patanjali Shastra, yama and niyama.

72
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,879
The niyama are the rules for yourself,
what rules you have to observe.

73
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,639
And what rules you have to observe
for others is yama,

74
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,256
where - how to deal with others, what
should be your relationship

75
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:19,560
to your wife, to your children, to other
relations that are there,

76
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,440
and how you must respect particular things

77
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:26,688
and to prepare yourself for
Self-realization, the ascent.

78
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,662
All this balance has to be there if you
have to ascend in life.

79
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:36,738
Even to lead a proper good life you have
to be like that.

80
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:40,710
I tell you, if you go to India you’ll find
the country

81
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:46,720
hasn’t got any sanitation whatsoever,
hasn’t got all the food that you have,

82
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:51,760
hasn’t got any of your railways or any one
of these your telephones as they are.

83
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,763
And when I go to India I forget that
there are telephones existing.

84
00:10:54,964 --> 00:11:01,239
They never use this for Me there. Everything
that is so dislocated, mismanaged,

85
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,323
all kinds of funny things are there.
Sometimes there is a drought.

86
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:08,051
Sometimes there is a flood. All these
things are there.

87
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:14,104
Despite that, people are existing only
because they know

88
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:21,759
how to lead a proper life, to adjust
themselves to natural things.

89
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,848
Now the new disease that has come up
in America, AIDS,

90
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:32,760
has really upset Me very much. And I know
that it was to come, because today,

91
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:37,066
according to predictions it is not Kali
Yuga anymore, it is Kruta Yuga.

92
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:40,039
Is the time when things will happen,

93
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,271
Kruta Yuga means when the spiritual powers
will work out.

94
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:48,666
This is the time is already - you know that
in our books it is written

95
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:54,320
that the Kruta Yuga has started about sixty
years back, and that is how it is,

96
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,214
that now the spiritual powers are going
to react.

97
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,988
It’s easy to say, “What’s wrong? Who is
God? We don’t believe in God.”

98
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,986
You’ll have to pay for that.

99
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:09,559
If you go against the nature you’ll have
to pay for it.

100
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,119
If you do things according to your own ego,
you’ll have to pay for it.

101
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,126
This is the time that has come. This is
for our good.

102
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,666
This is not for our bad,

103
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:24,504
because it has been told many-a-times
not to do certain things.

104
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:28,200
Of course, in the Western countries where
Christianity is followed

105
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,119
is precisely told not to do this, not to do
that.

106
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,239
But then people say, “Why they have
said it?”

107
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,475
The only difference is that in the East
it is explained

108
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:42,239
why not to do this, why not to do that,

109
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,520
what happens. It has gone into the details
of it.

110
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,999
But I must say here also people know that
this is not to be done.

111
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,003
But when you talk about these things,
“This is not to be done”,

112
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:57,196
they will brand you as Victorian, or
they’ll mock at you,

113
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,760
laugh at you, make fun of you.

114
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,479
But when they face all these things
happening to you,

115
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,537
then they don’t know where to go, what
to do and how to face up to it.

116
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the time where the spiritual powers
are going to work out;

117
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,679
they are going to prove the existence
of God.

118
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,240
They are going to prove the existence
of Divine laws and their operation.

119
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,159
They are going to prove all that is said
in all the religions,

120
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,679
their unity, and their integration.
Everything is going to be proved now today.

121
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,919
Even if you say this many-a-times,
many people will not pay any heed to it.

122
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,448
They will say, “Oh, Mother is just
brainwashing us.”

123
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,119
That’s what people told Me when I came
first to England.

124
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,879
That I said, “This is not the life human
beings should lead.

125
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,472
Even for animals it is not suitable.
How can you dare into these things

126
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:59,879
and get involved into problems? Later on
it will be showing results.”

127
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,119
But nobody was willing to listen to Me at
that time and everybody was angry with Me.

128
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,865
They said, “This woman is matronly.”
There are certain words in English

129
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:13,599
which are very condemning. Like first
one of them is Victorian.

130
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,313
If you are Victorian you are a gone case,
absolutely,

131
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:19,319
that you are branded on; then you
can’t talk.

132
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,780
But I would say even Victorian was better,
where there was some hypocrisy I agree.

133
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:29,346
Hypocrisy is a bad thing. But shamelessness
is much worse.

134
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:37,383
If you become shameless the thing spreads
like fire. There is no protection.

135
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:41,759
Hypocrisy is at least a little protection
from the spreading of it.

136
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,840
And everybody today thinks what’s wrong
in it,

137
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,274
and I, when I came here, I had such
a shock.

138
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:54,280
I couldn’t believe that human beings could
go to that extent to ruin themselves.

139
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,879
This is ruinous, absolutely ruinous it is.

140
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,319
And when a person like Christ, who was
nothing but purity, said

141
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,759
that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes”;

142
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,585
to that extent, to that subtle extent
of purity He talked -

143
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:16,483
I was amazed how people have denied Him
completely and how all other people

144
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:23,070
like Jews, like even Hindus here,
Christians, every sort of people

145
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:30,236
didn’t think what they were professing,
what they were claiming and what they were.

146
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:36,399
Today again, one-by-one you will see
more results of wrongdoings to yourself.

147
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,279
This is because you have crossed
all the limits of niyamas,

148
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,460
how you should be to yourself. Everyone
seems to be sick today,

149
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,622
either mentally or physically. Why?

150
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,160
Why are they mentally sick there? This is
the physical side of it.

151
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:58,044
The mental side is, they can run into
any sort of thing like witchcraft,

152
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:02,799
like spiritualism, like any guru who comes
and talks about God,

153
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,458
without finding out the credibility of it,
without finding out

154
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,800
what others have achieved by it.

155
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,279
Not only that, but I have seen people
after being harmed very much,

156
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,359
who have been tortured by these gurus,

157
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,851
who have been completely made beggars
by these gurus,

158
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:31,383
still profess, still fight for those gurus,

159
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:38,119
as if they have lost all their freedom,
all their independence to fight it back.

160
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,879
The other day one lady came to tell Me

161
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,439
that she went to a relation’s place to stay
with her,

162
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,509
and the relation was so funny that she
wouldn’t even give them full food to eat,

163
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,960
and in the house there was limited food,
and she would lock up everything

164
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:02,025
and they really starved themselves, you
see. But she – I knew her very well –

165
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:05,387
so she telephoned to Me. I said, “You come
along to My house,” and just called her

166
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:10,504
and I was amazed why these things happened
in the life of that woman.

167
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:15,480
How could she do it? She had no conscience!
Somebody starving next door to her.

168
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:20,036
The reason was she was a drunkard.
She used to drink a lot.

169
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:26,696
Her husband used to drink. Now with the
amount of money they earn you cannot drink.

170
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,839
Is a simple thing, leave alone all
the other side of it.

171
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,319
And she was drinking, her husband was
also drinking.

172
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,833
And they, whatever money they have,
they don’t eat much, they just drink,

173
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,160
and they were waiting for this woman
to disappear.

174
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,047
Because once you become enslaved to one
particular madness like this,

175
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:50,678
like drinking or anything, then you forget
all your relationships

176
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:53,805
with all your other duties that you have
to perform.

177
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:58,132
It’s like one madman, you see, doing work
like mad,

178
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,599
has no consideration of relationships

179
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,760
or any duties that he has to perform
with others.

180
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:11,370
Then also he has no time to think about
the duties towards himself.

181
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:16,519
He becomes such a dry personality that
he has no conscience even.

182
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,079
And he just shuts up his mind from all
that is gracious,

183
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,627
all that is sublime, all that is compassion.
He is just busy with himself.

184
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:31,880
He wants to drink. He wants to drink,
that’s all.

185
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,457
Very seriously he’ll say, “Yes, I have
to drink now. I like it”.

186
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:41,080
So it doesn’t matter if his dog doesn’t get
the food

187
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:45,879
or if his children have to starve or if
they have to work on the streets.

188
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,360
He doesn’t mind because he has to drink.

189
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,079
Then there is another thing, like today
I saw so many people enjoying cricket –

190
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,221
I Myself can enjoy cricket very well and I
understand cricket very well.

191
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:06,672
But how much time do they pay to themselves
in the sense they are just enjoying

192
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:15,400
what is something entertaining. But what
about the entertainment of your Spirit?

193
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:21,830
Have you thought of your Spirit at all?
Have you ever peeped into yourself

194
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:26,840
and found out that there is Spirit, which
has to be satisfied and entertained?

195
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:30,344
And once you entertain that Spirit you
don’t need any entertainment.

196
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,239
If you have it, well and good, if you don’t
have it, well and good.

197
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,440
That is the highest type of entertainment.
That’s the highest type of enjoyment.

198
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,870
That’s the highest life that one can
ask for.

199
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,680
So all these things come to a level where,
“What’s wrong?

200
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,429
What’s wrong in this and what’s wrong
in that?”

201
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,349
So the nature is now going to show you
what’s wrong.

202
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,839
Because intelligently you understand,
rationally you understand,

203
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,519
logically you understand it is wrong.

204
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,279
But still there is somebody else who says,
“What’s wrong?”

205
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,079
So now, experiencing it you understand.

206
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,774
That’s the only way left for nature
to make you understand:

207
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:21,023
now experience it, suffer it.

208
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,419
There is another way, is that you can
experience your Spirit.

209
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:32,880
Also it’s possible only this Krita Yuga can
do that,

210
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:37,399
that you can experience the enjoyment
of your Spirit.

211
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,203
Both things are there. When it does
one thing, it does the other way also.

212
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:51,365
It also gives you the experience
of reality, the experience of truth,

213
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:57,759
the life that is eternal, and that’s what
one has to look forward to.

214
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,343
But enslavement has to be brought down
to a proper shape, little bit.

215
00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:06,514
That also it does. I was amazed some people

216
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,470
who had been drunkards and alcoholics,
in Sahaja Yoga they came;

217
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,861
next day they left it. It does that.

218
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:21,479
Enslavement of any kind, of any habit,
is detrimental to our growth in Spirit.

219
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,846
It is detrimental, but doesn’t matter:
if you have some habits

220
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:30,684
they just drop out, as you have seen.
Sahaja Yoga is such a kind, compassionate

221
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:35,491
happening that it really makes you

222
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:42,000
a different person who is a master
of himself; no more enslavement.

223
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,839
All this slavishness goes away. All this
fear disappears.

224
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,680
You become master of yourself and in that
mastery you are the master of love,

225
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,405
master of compassion, master of wisdom.
This should happen to all of us.

226
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:06,636
You are all due for it. You are
created for it.

227
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:09,800
You all have evolved for it. You have
to have it.

228
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,419
But there are so many misidentifications
in us

229
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,543
with which we are drawn to wrong things,

230
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:21,008
to things which are anti-God, which are
anti-Spirit.

231
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,798
So many things are there which divert
your mind to that

232
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,359
because you have drawn certain conclusions
about reality.

233
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,600
You think this is the reality. You believe
that this is the reality

234
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:40,155
and you want to stick on to that. But that
is not so.

235
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:45,960
I tell you, you have to understand that
reality is what it is.

236
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,880
You should face it and enjoy it. Don’t try
to put your ideas on it.

237
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,541
Don’t try to organize the reality. It is
what it is.

238
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:59,255
And once you decide within yourself,
“So far I have not known

239
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:04,119
and I have to know,” with that humility,
you’ll get it.

240
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,190
It doesn’t mean that you have to surrender
your money or anything,

241
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:13,758
your self-respect or your freedom.
On the contrary, you have to enter

242
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:19,959
into that area where there is supreme
freedom, supreme freedom.

243
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,599
You are not free. If you think you are
free, you are sadly mistaken,

244
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,981
because we are still slaves of so many
things.

245
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:35,320
But once a person is free he is not
bothered about anything.

246
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,066
Nothing can make him habituated
to anything. Nothing.

247
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:47,491
Such a person lives like a king, whether
he is in a hut, on a street or in a palace.

248
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,936
He is not bothered. Whatever it is he is
the king. He doesn’t want anything anymore.

249
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:57,385
He gives. He gives. He’s so rich that
nobody can give him anything.

250
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,559
He gives and gives and gives.

251
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,879
And only thing that it can do is to give;
it cannot take anything.

252
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,959
The capacity is such that he cannot take
anything from anyone.

253
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,381
No more these attitudes, how to save money,
how to save your labor,

254
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:20,360
how to save your chairs, your powers,
your positions.

255
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:24,319
Nothing remains there, because you are
the master of everything.

256
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:31,961
Nothing is more important than your own
Spirit, which you enjoy, which manifests.

257
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:37,679
It’s so fortunate that you are born
at a time when it is Krita Yuga,

258
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,607
and you have taken your birth deliberately
to get this realization.

259
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:47,803
That’s why you are here. But how many
realize that you have to come

260
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:56,320
to terms with many things? You have to seek
the truth and not the untruth.

261
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,159
You don’t have to run after people who
make fools out of you

262
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,800
or those who try to pamper your ego,

263
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,719
or who put spirits in you, and make useless
cabbages.

264
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,599
You have to become something greater,
healthier, mightier

265
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,588
and loving, affectionate, compassionate.

266
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:28,203
That should be the picture of
the personality that has to evolve

267
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,120
out of human beings. Otherwise we cannot
save this world.

268
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,079
With the kind of people we have we cannot
save.

269
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,295
They are all compromising, they are all
manipulating, maneuvering

270
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,719
as if they are all getting drowned, and
everybody has to somehow or other

271
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,790
pull out the person ahead of them
to come up.

272
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:54,583
All funny things happening in this world.
That is only because we are so insecured.

273
00:25:54,784 --> 00:26:02,519
The insecurity will all go away once the
light – the light of your Spirit shines.

274
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,976
Let the light shine through and see your
beauty and glory and your strength

275
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:13,039
of that great power of love of God
within yourself

276
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,439
and then you’ll be amazed what it is.

277
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,718
As you know, Sahaja Yoga is not one
lecture, is not two,

278
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:28,280
can be hundreds, but the happening takes
[a] split of a second. It should happen.

279
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:34,911
Once it happens you can achieve
your realization

280
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:39,890
in such a way that you won’t even feel it.

281
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:44,720
But afterwards you have to put in
deliberations.

282
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,360
You have to look after yourself. You have
to respect yourself and go ahead with it.

283
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:56,403
There’s no use arguing about it. Even if
you argue I can take you up to a point

284
00:26:56,604 --> 00:27:02,400
because this is the realm beyond the mind,
because mind is a limited thing.

285
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,239
We have to achieve the unlimited and
for that a happening has to take place.

286
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,911
We can’t promise you that it will take
place. If it takes place, well and good,

287
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:20,099
we can help you in a way to achieve it, but
we cannot be sure that it will happen.

288
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:27,520
So be in a receptive mood and be kind
to yourself and achieve your realization.

289
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:30,448
This is the last time I’m speaking now
in London.

290
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:38,240
For quite some time I won’t be here, maybe
in November if I come for a short time;

291
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,743
I may be in London, may be outside London,
somewhere in England; I can’t say.

292
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:49,933
I hope all those who are today should
decide that if they have

293
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:55,400
to achieve their realization as a permanent
blessing from God,

294
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,440
then they have to go further with it.
You cannot just stop it at this meeting.

295
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:04,560
You have to go further with it with greater
enquiries. You have to go

296
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:08,639
to different ashrams and centers that
we have; you have to work it out.

297
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,055
If you are a big man, like the other day
somebody came as a managing director

298
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,497
and tried to be funny, I said, “If you are
a managing director

299
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:18,864
this is not the place for you.” God doesn’t
understand. You may be the king.

300
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,479
You might be the president. You might
be anyone.

301
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,526
God doesn’t understand these man-made
positions. God’s positions are different

302
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:31,052
and if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God come as a humble person.

303
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:35,571
Give up all your ideas about your big
positions and big education and all that.

304
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:40,799
Be a humble person. If you are humble
then it will work out,

305
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,240
and not only that it will work out but
it is the only chance

306
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,559
we human beings have to change the whole
world. There’s no other chance I can see.

307
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,599
I hope all of you will pay full attention
to it

308
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:07,591
and ardently, with full devotion, seek your
Self and its ascent and its establishment.

309
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,802
May God bless you all.

310
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,680
If you have any questions you can ask
Me today.

311
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:48,539
Yes. Seeker: Shri Mataji, could you say
something about collective

312
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,426
and the need for people who have been
realized to be together?

313
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,663
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

314
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,839
Yogi: Mother, could you please say
something about the collective

315
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,582
and the need for realized souls to be
together?

316
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:10,945
Shri Mataji: Oh, all right. That’s a very
nice suggestion.

317
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:15,289
I would like to say something about
collectivity.

318
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:22,413
So far as you know, in the history of
spirituality people have got realization.

319
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:28,977
Many people have got it. One after another,
many people got it

320
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:38,760
but I would say one in a million, one
in a ten million, like that,

321
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,702
because we have to have some people to talk
about it, to begin with.

322
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:49,759
We always see what was written
in the past, you see,

323
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,239
but those people who got realization
single-handed suffered a lot,

324
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,757
and they could not transmit what it was
needed to be given to others

325
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,780
in a way that would be acceptable.

326
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:14,319
Now as you see, any discovery is made,
like that people can benefit individually.

327
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,620
Every person can say, “Oh, I have got it.
So I can have it in my house,” you see;

328
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:24,639
but it is of no value. It is of no value,
I can tell you.

329
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,653
I would say a personality like Christ came
on this earth. We had Christianity;

330
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,879
what have they done about it? I mean,
it’s a sad affair.

331
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,812
I mean, to think such a personality to come
and what a great job He has done

332
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:41,879
to establish Himself on Agnya chakra,
what people have done out of it, you see.

333
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,381
The reason was He was seldom; He was
alone. It was not a mass thing.

334
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,880
That was not the time, because He had
to establish this center.

335
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,680
Without that it could not be mass,
all right?

336
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,520
It could not be an en masse realization
but He talked about,

337
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,244
“You have to be born again,” and all that.
But the whole thing fizzled out

338
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:04,560
because they could not get to the essence
of it.

339
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,840
One person of that caliber coming
on this earth

340
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,584
found it impossible to convince people
and talk about it.

341
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:22,542
So one has to understand that anything
that is evolutionary

342
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:29,079
first happens to one or two persons only,
but then it happens to many people.

343
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,649
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s another problem
apart from that, that it is happening

344
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,180
to many people, it is there, no doubt.
Thousands are getting realization,

345
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:39,800
it’s no doubt. It’s working out that way,

346
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:44,119
that now the evolution has come to this
stage, as I say it’s the blossom time,

347
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,519
many flowers are there and they have
to become the fruits.

348
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,669
But now why is it necessary to have
collectivity when people are getting

349
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,079
realization like that, is a very important
point one has to understand.

350
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:04,760
The thing is that now, when you are getting
realized, what is happening to you?

351
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:07,399
You are getting related to the whole.

352
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,518
Our microcosm is getting related
to the macrocosm.

353
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:18,080
Say your body is there and you are
sleeping. First you get a little awakening.

354
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,400
You open your fingers, all right? Then you
open your, another finger.

355
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,400
Now there is a little trouble on your
finger and you can’t see anything.

356
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,680
So you open your eyes and you pay your
attention to your hands.

357
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:38,244
So that trouble may be all right but you
need another hand to help me.

358
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:43,330
So you want the another hand also to be
awakened to that point, like that.

359
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:48,040
So when the Sahaja Yogis are getting
awakened more and more, you see,

360
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,200
the problems that are facing us, we can
solve them better,

361
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,744
because so many people are working out
the problem.

362
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:59,303
Do you understand My point now? Together!
When we are together

363
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,880
we understand now there’s a problem,
now I’m going to America.

364
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:12,268
I’ve gone in 1970 - 1973 first, I think,
yes.

365
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:18,810
1973 I went first. I was alone! I mean,
I gave them very good lectures,

366
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,159
we had very big halls filled up and
everything – but everything fizzled out.

367
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,182
The reason is the people who got
realization didn’t have anybody

368
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:31,485
to look after them, there was nobody
to support them, give them assistance,

369
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:36,639
so they got lost. I mean, they are there,
some of them are here and there.

370
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,200
Now what has happened now? Today when
I’m going to America everybody is praying.

371
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:47,799
In Australia they are praying. In India
they are praying.

372
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,057
Like attention, you’ll be surprised some
people are coming from India

373
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:55,319
to go down to America. Some are coming
from Australia to go down to America.

374
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,879
Some are coming from France, some
from Switzerland.

375
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,960
They are all rushing to America.
Now the job is in America.

376
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,742
All right, so, like the attention you see,
as soon as somebody pricks Me here,

377
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:10,510
My hand goes there, My head goes there,
everything works it out.

378
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:16,079
So the collective working-out effort
is going to solve the problem.

379
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,220
But supposing if this finger is fighting
with this finger, can I write anything?

380
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:26,014
Or if they are secluded and alone,
can I use them?

381
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:33,440
All this body has to become absolutely
in concord with each other.

382
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:40,639
But so many are still sleeping. Those who
are awakened at least must stick together.

383
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,519
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out.

384
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,600
Today I find it much easier to give
realization, much easier.

385
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:52,129
I was struggling with six people for four
years in your London.

386
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:58,439
Four years, six people. But once they got
realization it started working faster

387
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,932
and the more people we get – because
the channel that is to be used

388
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:09,880
is like nerves in the body. You become
a nerve of that body which is awakened,

389
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,283
and once the nerves start working out
together

390
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:16,680
realizing that there’s one force that is
flowing through them,

391
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,438
all of you have to work it out together
with understanding of the Divine.

392
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,315
It works faster. Any person whose all
nerves are at work

393
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:34,840
will be much more dynamic than a person
who is half-dead or is full-dead.

394
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,399
So you can understand how collectivity
is important.

395
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,680
Then another thing is that going to
a very enjoyable part of it,

396
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:52,200
that when the Sahaja Yogis are collectively
there, they really enjoy.

397
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,896
Because for the first time you start
enjoying human beings, first time.

398
00:36:57,097 --> 00:36:58,689
Before this you never enjoyed them.

399
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,440
You enjoyed flowers, you enjoyed everything
else, but not human beings.

400
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,922
Pure enjoyment of human beings starts
coming when you become fully realized.

401
00:37:08,123 --> 00:37:11,799
I’ll give you an example. We went
to Calcutta for one day

402
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,559
and I was in a room in one hotel

403
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,519
and there were three, four Sahaja Yogis
in another hotel - another room,

404
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,879
and one gentleman came to Me
for his realization.

405
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,479
And when I raised his thing, the Kundalini,
you see, they all got vibrated

406
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,713
and they all rushed to My room

407
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:40,239
to know “What has happened, suddenly how
is it we got such joy within ourselves”.

408
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,826
They came to see, and this man was there.
He was a great soul

409
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,317
and they felt the vibrations, tremendous,
you see.

410
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:52,320
So it is not the happening of an individual.
It is the happening of the whole.

411
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:55,406
And the individual effort is going to be
absolutely useless.

412
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,610
It will be all neutralized. If you sit
at home, do your meditation,

413
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:04,930
it won’t work out. You won’t go very far.
Because the whole has to come up.

414
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:13,519
I’ll give an example that when you churn
the butter -

415
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,199
in India, I don’t know, we don’t do that
way; we do it very naturally –

416
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,479
you put a little butter inside that and
then again you start churning.

417
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,318
So the butter starts gathering round that
butter, all of it comes together.

418
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,840
But some particles are left out. They stick
to the sides, stick to that.

419
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:39,680
They are no more as butter; they are thrown
away as buttermilk. Is as simple as that.

420
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:46,601
You see, the more you gather together,
you really enjoy the spirit of friendship,

421
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:57,159
spirit of mirth, spirit of love in pure
form. So far the love is biased.

422
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,519
There’s sex, there’s lust, there’s money,
there’s this, there’s relationship.

423
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,485
This is, “You are British; so I must love
you,” “I am Indian;

424
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,682
so I must love you.” All these nonsensical
barriers are there.

425
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:13,159
There you love a human being because
he is a human being

426
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,039
and he is a yogi, speaks the same language.

427
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,080
Now today I have attended a wedding party
and the bride and the bridegroom said,

428
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:27,639
“We are coming to Paris with you, Mother.
There are hundred people coming to Paris,

429
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,747
because we have to change Paris”, you see.
“But,” I said, “you are recently married.

430
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:34,297
Now better enjoy your honeymoon.”
They said, “What are we going to enjoy?

431
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,239
We’ll enjoy there our honeymoon”,
so they are coming up there.

432
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,840
Even if I tell them, “You don’t come,”
they won’t listen.

433
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,362
They will enjoy their honeymoon there only.

434
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,914
I never said, “You come”, on the contrary,
I’m saying, “You go away.

435
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:47,341
I will give you money to enjoy your
honeymoon wherever you feel like.”

436
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:50,479
They wouldn’t go, because they know
where enjoyment lies,

437
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,703
with their brothers, with friends and
sisters. It’s absolutely so,

438
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,759
I tell you, that the enjoyment of human
beings has not been there.

439
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,731
Now there are people who live in India,
who live in Australia,

440
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:09,639
who live here, all over the places,

441
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,237
but when the Sahaja Yogis go to India
you should see them,

442
00:40:13,438 --> 00:40:19,027
the way the Sahaja Yogis in the villages,
the way they embrace them,

443
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:23,080
the way they feel the oneness. Never
they have felt like this for a white skin.

444
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,482
If they saw a white skin they would just
run away

445
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:29,008
and hide themselves under this thing,
you see. And even now

446
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,653
people are sometimes frightened to see
a white skin in a village.

447
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,519
They say, “Oh, God, they have come just
to destroy us!” or something like that.

448
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,399
But now that’s over. Now it’s a human
being, a human being is coming.

449
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,464
They are all embracing. For there is
nothing like a black or a white

450
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:49,893
or anything left now. It’s such a love that
grows and an understanding.

451
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:54,168
That’s only possible if you learn how
to live collectively.

452
00:40:54,369 --> 00:41:00,359
And collectivity also teaches you where
you are. Very important it is.

453
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,759
A person who has not lived collectively
cannot understand.

454
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,013
I have seen people who have their own
families, live with their families,

455
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:11,331
they are Sahaja Yogis - but once they come
to the ashram

456
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:14,319
they know they are not yet there.

457
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:18,561
Because you have to adjust, you have
to learn to adjust,

458
00:41:18,762 --> 00:41:24,655
you can’t have private bathroom
to yourself, private room to yourself.

459
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:28,252
All right, you can have if you want to have,
but you should also know how to adjust.

460
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,932
As you know, I live very comfortably
Myself,

461
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,640
but if it comes to living I can live
anywhere,

462
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,839
I have no problem of comfort or anything.

463
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,800
In the same way we are not barred from
enjoyment. Because of all these things,

464
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,889
the way we carry our bathrooms with us,
we do not enjoy life.

465
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,364
[You] see, [you] want to have everything
absolutely first class that has, say,

466
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:53,217
that even when we go to the picnic we take
all the metropolitan with us.

467
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:56,752
In the same way we cannot enjoy life.
We cannot enjoy nature.

468
00:41:56,953 --> 00:42:02,441
We cannot enjoy anything as long as we
become just an individual,

469
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,960
“Oh, I am the one who is going to get it.”

470
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:10,989
The last of all we must know by
individualism we become malignant.

471
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,855
I don’t say become communist, because
that’s another malignancy;

472
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:19,121
but by becoming individuals we become
malignant. What is malignancy?

473
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:23,800
That an individual cell takes up upon
itself, “I will grow, I will grow.”

474
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:27,864
It doesn’t know how to grow with the whole.
It has no coordination with the whole.

475
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:31,879
That’s why you say it is a cancer.

476
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,704
Cancer is nothing but is a malignant cell
which is alone

477
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:42,099
and is saying that, “I have to achieve it.
I can do it, I can manage it”.

478
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,399
And once it starts growing like that,

479
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,839
whosoever it touches, that person becomes
the same.

480
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,520
All these ideas – we are higher race
or we are greater people,

481
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,642
we are moneyed people, we are something
special,

482
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:01,070
we are of this club – all this disappears.

483
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:06,533
It’s all nonsensical. We are identified
with nonsensical things

484
00:43:06,734 --> 00:43:11,119
and making ourselves miserable and others
also miserable.

485
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,674
And then you give up all that. Suddenly
you find, “Oh, what enjoyment!”

486
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:21,830
You don’t want anything, you just want
to be in the company of Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:25,799
I have seen people, ambassadors, very
highly placed people,

488
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,325
just getting lost with the Sahaja Yogis.

489
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:34,509
The other day I had a businessman from
Bombay. I took him down with Me

490
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:42,356
to a place called Gurai; and it was all
in a mess,

491
00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:45,760
in the sense there were no proper
bathrooms, there were…

492
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,650
It was just like a God-forsaken place,
I tell you.

493
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:52,839
And there weren’t even places to sit down
properly,

494
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,799
only the beach and the palm trees and all
sorts of thing was there.

495
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,519
And the man got lost into that, absolutely
lost.

496
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,080
And he said, “I never wanted this day
to finish.

497
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,039
Is the only day I’ve really enjoyed myself
thoroughly”.

498
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,805
Because there was such spontaneity,
such spontaneous love,

499
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:20,479
such attention and such purity
in the atmosphere.

500
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,097
To enjoy that purity you have to be
in the collective.

501
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:29,224
Sitting down in the room, you can’t
understand, there is no reflection of you.

502
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:32,920
You can’t understand where are you,
how far you are going.

503
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,599
Collectivity is the most important thing,

504
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,439
and those who try to break the collectivity
are doing anti-Sahaja activity.

505
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,679
[You] see, we call it a-Sahaja movement
or you can say a-Sahaja activitiy.

506
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,397
You have to be one with the whole. Those
who have tried to separate themselves,

507
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:57,300
all of them go down in Sahaja Yoga.

508
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:05,023
Try to be one with everyone, to share
and enjoy everybody’s being,

509
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:10,771
because God has created you so beautifully.
You are so beautiful.

510
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:15,550
And the enjoyment should not be lost
because you have certain barriers;

511
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:18,621
like some people can’t take out their
shoes, I mean, just imagine

512
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:21,839
how much they are identified with their
shoes.

513
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,957
They can’t take out their shoes. To that
extent they are stupid!

514
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,691
[You] see, all this kind of stupidity
drops out

515
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,040
once you meet really wise people
around you.

516
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,211
To get rid of all these nonsensical ideas,
which have really

517
00:45:37,412 --> 00:45:42,330
haunted your head all these days, you get
rid of them

518
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:50,040
and you really enjoy everyone, whether
he is a doorman or he is a chairman,

519
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,960
all of them are men for you. It’s nothing
more than that.

520
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,879
All that drops out and you start enjoying
your Self.

521
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,080
That’s why collectivity is the only way
I can work out Sahaja Yoga.

522
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:11,039
I can’t think I can work out through
the people who are separated, divided.

523
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,599
It is said, Christ has said also that…
They said, “What have we to do?”

524
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,048
He said, “When you love each other you have
done the greatest justice to Me”.

525
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:28,080
It’s true. And when I hear the loving
conversation of the Sahaja Yogis

526
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:31,320
I feel the happiest. That’s the greatest
happiness for Me,

527
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,465
that all of you should love each other
in purity, without any return,

528
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:41,840
only for love’s sake you all should love
each other. And that is what it is!

529
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:46,400
And also Krishna has said, “Wherever people
are there gathered together

530
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:49,363
in the name of God, I reside within them”.

531
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:53,404
So in that joint - so-called joint, because
you are all one,

532
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,640
moving with one rhythm, with one
understanding, with one language,

533
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:03,520
so you all should always meet, call each
other and have rapport with each other.

534
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:08,680
It’s so beautiful. It’s musical.
It’s poetical.

535
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,419
Do you understand that? May God bless you.

536
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:21,840
And see for yourself when you cut out
your collectivity.

537
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:25,525
Just abuse yourself at that point. That
this is one thing

538
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:30,639
you are trying to teach Me now, I’m not
going to listen to this nonsense.

539
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,774
We are collective being otherwise also.
I mean, we cannot,

540
00:47:34,975 --> 00:47:38,241
people cannot take even drinks without
somebody being there.

541
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:41,771
You can’t take your food alone.
In so many things,

542
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:46,879
I mean, if you are not absolutely
a recluse you can’t live alone.

543
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,705
Then in religion, in the seeking,

544
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:56,717
especially in the realm of God,
how can it be?

545
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:00,573
You all have to be there.

546
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:09,679
I think it was a very good question,
rightly asked.

547
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,808
This individualism must be given up.

548
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,904
That doesn’t mean you all should dress up
like military people –

549
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:21,319
that’s not necessary –

550
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,999
or you should all behave in the same
manner – that’s not necessary.

551
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,320
Variety brings all the beauty. But that
doesn’t mean that

552
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:35,864
if I say it is East you should say
it is West.

553
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:45,050
That’s the main trouble is, I think,
isn’t it?

554
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:50,159
That you can’t agree to each other.

555
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,653
What’s the problem in collectivity,
you think.

556
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:01,611
I can ask the question.

557
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:18,115
Must get out of individual limitations.

558
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,294
I think everybody should for some time go
and live in an ashram, is a good idea.

559
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:33,720
But ashram must be such where there is
collectivity.

560
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,360
In the ashram if they are fighting and
quarrelling -

561
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:44,704
then what’s the use of being in the ashram
also? But I leave it to you.

562
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:48,399
It’s all freedom to you. You just decide
yourself.

563
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,498
I have not put any rules and regulations
on you much,

564
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:59,199
because I want you to use your wisdom
and put everything right yourself.

565
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,702
You are all very wise people but must
have concord.

566
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:10,159
Listen to others. Talk to them. Find out
what’s the problem is.

567
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,679
On small, small things people fight.
It’s a very wrong thing.

568
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,040
Moreover, you have to have one person
as a leader to whom you should listen to.

569
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,594
If I find that fellow is useless I’ll throw
him away. You know that very well.

570
00:50:22,795 --> 00:50:24,932
Throw him away, not in the way people
throw away,

571
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,665
but he’ll just get out of Sahaja Yoga.
You know that very well.

572
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:31,290
So there should be no problem. But
everybody should not

573
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:36,038
try to dominate each other. That’s
a wrong idea.

574
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:43,513
Try to change your attitude. As I would
say, how far can you adjust?

575
00:50:43,714 --> 00:50:48,359
How far can you accommodate? Let’s see
that way.

576
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,697
You have to learn that from Me, isn’t it?

577
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:58,520
You must find out ways and methods of
accommodating yourself with others.

578
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:04,248
Just try to learn. It’s not difficult.
That’s the whole attitude of life,

579
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:09,604
is of competition and this and that - should
be changed. You must compete in loving,

580
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:13,749
compete in doing good things, compete
at working for others.

581
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,025
Like “I’ve opened the door, now I’ll not
take the phone”. Is very common.

582
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:24,159
“I’ve washed the things this morning, then
I will not wash in the evening”.

583
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,726
Then people start taking advantage as this.
Let them take advantage;

584
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:34,359
it is a disadvantage for them. Actually,
if you see the other side,

585
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:41,209
compete in service, compete in love,
compete in good things,

586
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,520
of saying good words, of communicating
in a sweeter way

587
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,414
that others feel happy, making others
happy.

588
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:57,399
Try to change your attitude towards others

589
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,560
and you’ll really enjoy, I tell you, you’ll
enjoy. That’s the way.

590
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,666
You know, if you say something to hurt
someone and upset someone,

591
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:08,320
it must be upsetting you definitely.
You may not show but it must be,

592
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,431
because whatever you do to others comes
back to you. Straightforward march,

593
00:52:12,632 --> 00:52:18,138
I tell you. It doesn’t stay there
altogether; it comes back to you.

594
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:23,199
So just try to be kind to others.

595
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,679
You may say that the other may try to harm
you, doesn’t matter.

596
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,720
Nobody can harm you because you are
the Spirit. Who can harm you?

597
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:35,086
You are the Spirit. So just try
to understand the person.

598
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:38,930
I tell you, after some time you’ll find
that person will become very soft.

599
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:42,200
So many Sahaja Yogis have become like
that automatically.

600
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,240
They all are here for seeking God,
isn’t it?

601
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:49,416
So to help them you have to be patient.

602
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,879
Give up your old methods and ways,
I must tell you:

603
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,690
to be curt, to be stern, to be angry,
there’s no need at all!

604
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:06,679
I’m telling you from My experience.
I’ve tried all these things.

605
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,907
It works, isn’t it? It does work.

606
00:53:13,896 --> 00:53:21,458
And you have to have faith in them and
faith in their ascent, in their quality.

607
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:28,479
I like people who praise others to Me.
I don’t like people who criticize others.

608
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,760
Try to support each other, help each other

609
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,563
and never talk about their past or anything
like that; it’s very sad.

610
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:44,067
Sometimes I’ve seen people are very hard
and in anger they say things

611
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,709
which one should never say. It’s not
gracious.

612
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:52,166
It’s not in the mannerism of Sahaja Yogis.
You should never say these things.

613
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:55,959
Do I ever say anything like that to you
about your past?

614
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,719
When you write to Me, even if I know
everything about you,

615
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:01,200
did I ever mention those things to you
at all?

616
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:03,480
Then why should you say things of the past?

617
00:54:03,681 --> 00:54:08,119
I have heard these things people just rake
it up and flung it back.

618
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,470
I have heard this kind of thing that they
bring it on other people, it’s not good.

619
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:17,199
One should be very gracious, very kind,

620
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,722
and understand that everybody has
tremendous potentiality.

621
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:31,532
Respect, respect and respect. Respect
yourself and you’ll respect others.

622
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,560
I hope now you won’t have problem
of collectivity after this lecture,

623
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:39,162
and if you have, you can listen to this
lecture again and again;

624
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:44,960
and My special humble request that try
to curb down your angles.

625
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:49,521
Automatically other angles will calm down.

626
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,200
But if it is a non-Sahaja Yogi then you all
should fight it together.

627
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:58,839
All should join together if [it] is
a non-Sahaja Yogi.

628
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,763
Nobody dare torture you or trouble you.
Those days are gone now.

629
00:55:04,964 --> 00:55:08,064
None of you will be troubled.

630
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,680
These are all satanic forces and they can
work through you also.

631
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,400
You must know when they give you such ideas
to fight and to quarrel.

632
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:26,760
Understand that this is anti-God. You are
doing God’s work.

633
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,719
You have to move towards more
understanding, more coordination;

634
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,120
because this is such a tremendous work
and of such a sublime nature,

635
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,583
that we have to be sublime ourselves.

636
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,624
All right, now is there any other question?
[It] was a very nice suggestion

637
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:58,394
but don’t give Me such big suggestions
that I have to speak for half an hour.

638
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:06,093
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, when you say
collective consciousness,

639
00:56:06,294 --> 00:56:11,398
does that exclude all the people who are
not Sahaja Yogis,

640
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,783
so does that mean that Sahaja Yogis are isolating
themselves

641
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:19,063
from the 90% of the people who are not
Sahaja Yogis?

642
00:56:19,271 --> 00:56:23,628
Shri Mataji: What is she saying? I just
couldn’t hear. Can you come?

643
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:31,119
You come here and tell Me. Yes, it’s
all right.

644
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:34,838
Sahaja Yogini: When you are talking about
being collectively conscious,

645
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,180
that excludes the people who are not Sahaja
Yogis and therefore the Sahaja Yogis

646
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:42,075
are isolating themselves from the people,
from the majority of the other people.

647
00:56:42,276 --> 00:56:44,999
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s it. No, no, no.

648
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,120
She says that when collectively Sahaja
Yogis become one

649
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,719
then those who are not Sahaja Yogis
are isolated. It’s not so.

650
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,036
You see, Sahaja Yogis have to be strong
enough. Now take it like this,

651
00:56:58,237 --> 00:57:02,599
that there are people, say, who are
in the water

652
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,664
and some people are in the boat, all right?

653
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:10,941
Now the people who are in the boat are
in the boat, so they are in a way

654
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:15,480
different from the people who are in the
water. That’s the situation is, all right?

655
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,400
Now the people in the boat have to save
the people who are in the water, all right?

656
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,399
So what I am saying that those who are
in the boat must first of all be united,

657
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,411
and then with full strength pull them out.
Why this collectivity?

658
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:36,943
Is just to pull out the rest of them.
This collectivity is just to achieve

659
00:57:37,144 --> 00:57:43,269
their emancipation, their realization,
all right? It doesn’t mean that

660
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:48,559
they should exclude. Actually the whole
collectivity is to bring those people out.

661
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:54,075
But, you see, there are lots of anti-God
activities going on in this world,

662
00:57:54,276 --> 00:57:58,541
you know that. For example, there’s a guru
who makes lots of money, all right?

663
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:03,117
And he has destroyed many people. Now
they come to Me and they are saved.

664
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:08,119
So he may send somebody here paid
for a job just to disturb us.

665
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,323
Then the duty of all the Sahaja Yogis is
to get together and see that,

666
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:13,939
to tell him that, “You see, now you are
doing wrong.

667
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,840
Your guru has done wrong to us and he
is going to do wrong to others.

668
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,319
Why do you join with that?” On that point
everybody should be one.

669
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,679
But if they are not strong and if they are
not one, they cannot pull out others.

670
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,571
You see, My point is like that. Not
to exclude - is all,

671
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:37,820
collectivity is to include everyone inside.
All right?

672
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:48,119
I mean to say, there is no specialization
in Sahaja Yoga, in simple words.

673
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,655
Everybody is a doctor of everything.

674
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:13,546
I mean to say that all the Sahaja Yogis
must form a strong group

675
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:18,229
by which they achieve enlargement
of Sahaja Yoga,

676
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:25,702
getting more people into Sahaja Yoga, more
people benefitted by Sahaja Yoga, all right?

677
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:29,983
All - anywhere I have seen, wherever there
is collectivity, like I would say,

678
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:36,602
Australia has the maximum collectivity,
or India of course it has, but Australia,

679
00:59:36,803 --> 00:59:40,519
in all the European countries, or I should
say the western-styled communities,

680
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,879
Australia has the maximum collectivity and
they have achieved the maximum results.

681
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,800
Only in Sydney, today only, Warren told Me

682
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,959
that the halls like this get packed
for programmes.

683
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,200
Melbourne, there is no room for new people
who are coming,

684
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:05,559
and it’s such a big compound I’m amazed,
I mean, how many must be going there.

685
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,044
And it is because of collectivity.
And as soon as I went there

686
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:14,920
it started gathering up. But before that
the people were fighting among themselves

687
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,120
and many people ran away from Sahaja Yoga
because they thought,

688
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,519
“These people are fighting, what are they
going to give us?”

689
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:29,821
Maximum is in Australia, I think. Then is
Austria is having some problem there,

690
01:00:30,022 --> 01:00:35,270
and as soon as the problem came in,
the whole thing became a very small group.

691
01:00:35,471 --> 01:00:38,843
Again that problem is over now; positivity
has come;

692
01:00:39,044 --> 01:00:42,399
the people have joined together; again
it has flourished.

693
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,471
It happens here also, we have seen.

694
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,542
Why Labor Party lost? If they had
not quarrelled

695
01:00:50,743 --> 01:00:54,861
they would not have been so badly off.

696
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,979
Is absolutely a simple equation,

697
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,683
“United we stand,” isn’t it?

698
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:11,865
Is there any other question?

699
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:23,839
All right. So how many are new people
today here?

700
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:33,479
Can you raise your hands please?
One, two, three, five, six.

701
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,119
All right. Can I request you to come
to the front seats?

702
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,959
That will be better, will help Me
better too,

703
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,805
because you are so much here and there,
all right? Just come, please.

704
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:46,917
Be comfortable. Yes, come along,
all of you.

705
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,182
Just be seated. Yes. Be comfortable.

706
01:01:53,399 --> 01:01:58,797
Now get some more chairs.

707
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:04,585
Can you get some more chairs here
for the front seats?

708
01:02:05,247 --> 01:02:08,737
Douglas, can you put them in a line?

709
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:15,384
They cannot be lifted; they are fixed,
are they? All right.

710
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:40,080
Now for all the new people I have to say
one thing,

711
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,256
that, you see, you cannot argue it out.

712
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:49,200
It has to work within you. It has to work
within you. It’s a happening.

713
01:02:49,401 --> 01:02:54,919
There is a force within you which we call
as Kundalini,

714
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:03,174
which is the pure desire of becoming one
with the Spirit.

715
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:08,279
All other desires are impure. That’s why
you are never satisfied.

716
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,639
Now this desire is not yet awakened
within us.

717
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:18,680
This power of desire, or energy of desire,
resides in the sacrum bone

718
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:24,167
and it has to be awakened, and when
it is awakened, it rises,

719
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:27,959
passes through six centers, subtle centers,

720
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,520
comes out of your medulla oblongata
into the brain

721
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,604
and then, out of this part which was a soft
bone in your childhood,

722
01:03:39,805 --> 01:03:44,239
and you start feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head,

723
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,679
and a cool breeze coming out of your hands
also afterwards.

724
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:56,508
Now this is a living process, as you cannot
force a seed to sprout.

725
01:03:56,709 --> 01:04:01,399
It sprouts by itself spontaneously, but you
have to put it in the Mother Earth.

726
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:12,078
In the same way it sprouts. It sprouts
spontaneously

727
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:19,174
and when it happens then you have to see
for yourself.

728
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:24,294
One can help because if there is
an obstruction on any chakras,

729
01:04:24,495 --> 01:04:27,559
especially if the Nabhi chakra is
caught up,

730
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,080
then what happens that on that center
the Kundalini tries to push

731
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:37,399
and you can easily see with your naked
eyes the pulsation

732
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:43,319
or the movement of your sacrum bone
just like a heart, just like a heart.

733
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:51,720
These things you cannot maneuver, you
cannot attain by effort.

734
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:56,999
Is a thing already settled there within you
and this has to be awakened.

735
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:04,198
Now what we can do is to try to remove
the hurdles that are there

736
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:08,576
during the ascent of the Kundalini.
That’s all we can do.

737
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:14,679
But if it doesn’t work out, we can work out
again and we can work out again.

738
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,920
But you have to have patience with yourself
and you have to have understanding

739
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,119
that you will get your realization.
It’s not so difficult.

740
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,680
All of these people who are sitting here
have got realization

741
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:32,959
and most of them are settled down
with their realization.

742
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,080
They know what the chakras are, what
are the obstructions,

743
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,399
how to remove the obstructions and how
to raise the Kundalini.

744
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,399
All this you will also know. All this
mastery you will also have,

745
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,680
but you have to, as I said, you have
to have that earnestness

746
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,520
and that kind of assiduity by which
you’ll achieve it.

747
01:05:54,721 --> 01:06:03,530
So it is for us to raise your Kundalini and
it is for us to help you to achieve it.

748
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:06,987
Then once you have achieved it and you
have mastered it,

749
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:12,560
it is for you to teach others and to give
realization to others.

750
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:18,728
It is as simple as that. So I’m sure
it will work out tonight

751
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:23,920
and that all will work it out. We should
all cooperate with each other.

752
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:27,099
Now some people who are frightened,
I have to tell them

753
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,080
there’s nothing to be frightened
in Sahaja Yoga.

754
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,639
Thousands of people have got realization
without any difficulty.

755
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,079
Or those who are still discussing in their
minds, must stop it now,

756
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,879
because they have not found it; better
prepare yourself to have the realization.

757
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:49,778
It is not to be paid for. You cannot put in
any effort. Nothing can be done.

758
01:06:49,979 --> 01:06:53,480
It has to work out, all right?

759
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,036
With this understanding let us see that

760
01:06:57,237 --> 01:07:00,360
few things, whatever I tell you, you try
to cooperate with Me.

761
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:04,800
One of them is a simple thing, is to remove
your shoes. Please remove your shoes.

762
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:08,325
There’s nothing in the shoes, you see.
If you remove the shoes,

763
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:14,462
you’ll become relaxed, little bit more,
and also I feel that it helps

764
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:19,630
the Mother Earth to suck in problems
very well.

765
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:23,039
It’s a very simple method by which
it should work out.

766
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:29,740
So I would request you to put both your
hands towards Me, just like this,

767
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:36,080
and close your eyes. That’s all. Just
close your eyes.

768
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:47,022
You will also know why I asked you to put
your hands towards Me later on.

769
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:52,757
So don’t think about it. There are five
fingers and six centers –

770
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:57,840
and seven centers all on your hands, and
when you put your hands towards Me

771
01:07:58,014 --> 01:08:01,200
the message goes to the Kundalini
and it rises.

772
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,239
It’s your own, everything is your own.
Only thing like one enlightened light

773
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,360
enlightens another light, I’m just
enlightening you

774
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:12,989
and then you can enlighten others exactly
the same way.

775
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,111
All right. I would request you also to take
out your spectacles

776
01:08:17,312 --> 01:08:20,277
if you have any, because it helps your
eyesight also.

777
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:23,423
It helps your eyesight. Just take out
your spectacles.

778
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:28,879
Any other obstacle, anything that is little
bit uncomfortable,

779
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,240
you can reduce the pressure on your waist
if it is very tight;

780
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,559
or anywhere you feel the tightness you can
reduce.

781
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,817
Put both the feet on the ground, little
separate from each other

782
01:08:41,018 --> 01:08:46,282
because both feet have different problems,
are to be attended to differently.

783
01:08:46,483 --> 01:08:51,203
Now please keep your eyes shut and I would
request you not to open your eyes

784
01:08:51,404 --> 01:08:54,960
till I tell you, because if your eyes are
open

785
01:08:55,161 --> 01:09:02,552
the Kundalini refuses to rise up to Agnya.
So please keep your eyes shut.

786
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:08,589
Just with complete faith in yourself

787
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:14,999
you just wait and it will work out.

788
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:21,959
If it doesn’t work out, we’ll try to tell
you how you yourself can work it out

789
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:28,111
by awakening your own centers.

790
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,887
You have to sit quietly.

791
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,416
Please put your right hand – don’t open
your eyes –

792
01:09:55,617 --> 01:09:59,014
please put your right hand on your heart.

793
01:09:59,215 --> 01:10:03,680
Because the left hand is the hand
of your desire

794
01:10:03,881 --> 01:10:07,599
so it should be kept where it is now
throughout.

795
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:15,039
Only you have to move the right hand because
the right hand is the hand of action.

796
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,974
Now at this stage you have to say – if you
are wearing a coat

797
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:23,849
put it from inside the coat, would be
better – hand on your heart

798
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:31,239
and left hand towards Me on the lap,
comfortably.

799
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,774
Now you please in your heart, with all
sincerity

800
01:10:36,975 --> 01:10:42,720
you have to ask the question thrice,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

801
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,422
Now why I say that you call Me Mother,
because you have to call Me

802
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:51,604
Shri Mataji, which is a tongue twister
and I think it will be difficult.

803
01:10:51,805 --> 01:10:56,481
So to make it easier, I say “Call Me
Mother”.

804
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:10,146
Please ask the question, “Mother, am I
the Spirit?”.

805
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:23,683
Because the Spirit has to come in your
attention; you have to become the Spirit.

806
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:30,809
Many people think if you pray without being
realized, God will do what you want.

807
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:35,643
He won’t, because you are not yet
connected. You have to be connected to God.

808
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:38,840
That’s why Christ has said you are to be
born again.

809
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,520
That’s not an artificial thing, it’s
a reality.

810
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:53,560
Now as the Spirit is your guide, it is your
guru, you don’t need any guide anymore,

811
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:59,185
put this right hand down on the stomach
on the left hand side again,

812
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:05,081
and push it a little. On your stomach
on the left hand side put the right hand

813
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:11,759
and left hand towards Me, and push it
a little bit and say –

814
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:17,502
you must put your hand on your stomach,
stomach on the left hand side

815
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:24,657
and press it a little bit because there
lies – the right hand, the right hand,

816
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:32,845
take it to the left side and put it
on the center on the left side.

817
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:39,960
And now you ask the question, “Mother,
am I my own guide?

818
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:43,640
Am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

819
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,960
Ask the question ten times because there
are ten sub-plexuses within us.

820
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:07,639
Later on your own guru, which is your
own Spirit, will guide you

821
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,200
because you’ll get vibratory awareness,
a new dimension in your awareness.

822
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,639
You’ll become collectively conscious.

823
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,754
You’ll become, again. It’s not just
a lecture but it is a happening.

824
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:29,294
Please ask ten times, “Mother, am I
my own guide? Am I my own guru?”.

825
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:06,061
Now again put the same right hand
on your heart

826
01:14:06,262 --> 01:14:12,640
and now you can assert by saying, “Mother,
I am the Spirit”.

827
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:19,119
Just say that. On the heart, on the heart,
put it on the heart,

828
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,600
the right hand on the heart, where
the Spirit is,

829
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:26,533
where it resides, is reflected
in your heart.

830
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:34,283
So just say, “Mother, I am the Spirit”,
with full assertion.

831
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,200
You have to say that twelve times.

832
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:25,950
Now as the Spirit is guiltless, it never
commits sins, it is blemishless,

833
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:32,184
it is absolutely spotlessly clean,
sparkling diamond within you,

834
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:37,040
you have to raise this right hand at the
base of the neck on the left hand side.

835
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,360
We have to move on the left hand side,
throughout.

836
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,822
At the base of the neck on the left hand
side. This is a very important center,

837
01:15:44,023 --> 01:15:51,763
very important center for the Western
people is through the neck,

838
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:56,978
at the neck on the left hand side.

839
01:15:59,315 --> 01:16:04,412
You put it on your shoulders on the left
hand side.

840
01:16:04,613 --> 01:16:08,606
Just take it from the front, will be
easier, yes; and press it hard.

841
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:14,653
And at this center you have to say that,
“Mother, I’m not guilty,”

842
01:16:14,854 --> 01:16:20,479
sixteen times, because if you are
the Spirit, how can you be guilty?

843
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,480
But really you must say, “I’m not guilty.”

844
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:28,350
Get away from all ideas that you have done
this wrong or that,

845
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:32,435
you have committed this sin and that sin.

846
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:59,790
“Mother, I’m not guilty.” Say it sixteen
times, please.

847
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,239
You are not guilty; you are just thinking
like that.

848
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,704
By thinking you have made yourself
miserable.

849
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:15,084
There’s not to feel guilty about anything.

850
01:17:52,240 --> 01:18:00,200
Now raise the same hand on your forehead.
Across. On your forehead across.

851
01:18:03,991 --> 01:18:12,599
At this point you have to forgive others.
This is the center of Christ.

852
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,439
He forgave the people who crucified Him.

853
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:25,159
In the same way you forgive everyone.
Forgive everyone.

854
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,160
Please forgive everyone. People say it is
difficult to forgive,

855
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,217
but if you don’t forgive, actually what
you are doing

856
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:37,384
is you are harming yourself, and not
the people who have harmed you.

857
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:43,225
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

858
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,000
From your heart. Whatever you are saying,
is working out.

859
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:02,399
So please say, “Mother, I forgive
everyone.”

860
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,450
If you don’t say it from your heart,
it will have no effect.

861
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,780
Now put the hand on top of your head,

862
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:19,635
where you had a soft bone, press it hard
with your palm.

863
01:19:19,836 --> 01:19:25,847
And just move it a little bit, sideways
if you put it is easier,

864
01:19:26,048 --> 01:19:32,040
in a clockwise manner – your head,
your scalp – you can say.

865
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:38,039
At this point it is the liberation point,

866
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:42,960
is that point where you get your moksha,
where you get your realization.

867
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:48,310
And I can’t cross your freedom. At this
point you have to say,

868
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:53,734
“Mother, I want my realization, please
give me my realization”,

869
01:19:53,935 --> 01:19:59,360
at least seven times. Say it seven times.

870
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:20,885
[A] lot of a heat is coming out. That’s
a good thing. Let the heat come out.

871
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,200
Now raise the hand and see if there’s
a cool breeze

872
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,119
or a hot breeze is coming out. First
the heat will come out.

873
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,280
You can change over your hand and see
with the other hand.

874
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,421
With the right hand towards Me, with
the right hand towards Me

875
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:47,720
and [the] left hand on top and see if
there’s a cool breeze coming out.

876
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,955
You may change again your hand, whenever
you feel like

877
01:21:59,156 --> 01:22:04,733
you can change your hand, and see if
there’s a cool breeze coming out.

878
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:15,927
He’s got it. He’s a born realized.
No problem with him. He is!

879
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,240
Let him feel yours.

880
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:27,996
Just feel him. On top, yes.

881
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:33,222
He’s got it?

882
01:22:40,959 --> 01:22:47,453
Their certificates are correct. If they
give you the certificate.

883
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,640
You have got it, long time back.

884
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:59,675
Have you felt it? Not yet. Don’t open
your eyes. Keep your eyes shut.

885
01:22:59,876 --> 01:23:02,573
It will work out.

886
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:07,440
You exchange your hands one by one
and see for yourself.

887
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:12,215
Put your attention there and see. You have
to work it out yourself.

888
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:15,639
Don’t get disappointed and don’t feel bad
about it.

889
01:23:15,841 --> 01:23:19,836
Just go ahead with it. It will work out.

890
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:29,439
Now I’ll ask some of the Sahaj Yogis
to come and see and help you.

891
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,515
Please come along. At the back of these
people, you know, those who are sitting,

892
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:39,160
can you see for that – this little one can
find out about everyone.

893
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:48,890
Now here, keep your eyes shut. It will
work out.

894
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,600
Don’t you worry and don’t feel
disappointed.

895
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,679
It has to work out. It has to work out.
Did you feel the cool breeze?

896
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,516
Good. You have felt it already. Good.
What about you? No?

897
01:24:00,717 --> 01:24:04,840
Why, why are you so dejected? It will
work out.

898
01:24:07,351 --> 01:24:11,999
John? Just try this gentleman.

899
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,040
Now, don’t think about it, just you keep
in meditation.

900
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,600
He’s got it. The first one has got it.
[The] second gentleman.

901
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:24,487
Shri Mataji: Now, what’s your name?
Child: Anna. Shri Mataji: Anna.

902
01:24:24,688 --> 01:24:29,796
Child: [Indistinct]

903
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:34,666
Shri Mataji: Let’s have him here,
let’s have him here.

904
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:38,914
She’s going to America now, she’s going
to America.

905
01:24:41,835 --> 01:24:45,271
[Indistinct]

906
01:24:53,092 --> 01:24:56,282
Hello, William, come along!

907
01:24:56,483 --> 01:25:00,622
Come up, come up, come up. Take some
chana.

908
01:25:00,823 --> 01:25:04,732
Be careful! Be careful.

909
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:09,641
Come along. William? Come here.

910
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:20,971
What about his teeth? Yogini: Yes, he’s
already got two big teeth coming, Mother.

911
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:27,189
Shri Mataji: But how can he eat this, he
will eat? Can he manage? All right.

912
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:40,500
Come from this side, all right? For you may
fall. Now come from this side, all right?

913
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:46,035
We’ll keep this one there. All right, now.
Now.

914
01:25:53,142 --> 01:25:56,737
You take this. Do you want to have?

915
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:08,020
Do you like it? Good! Will you have
some more?

916
01:26:08,245 --> 01:26:12,563
Will you have some more in your hand?
All right, you have it.

917
01:26:13,273 --> 01:26:16,529
What about you? Will you have some more?
Child: More!

918
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:20,534
Shri Mataji: More? Where is it going?
In your stomach?

919
01:26:26,177 --> 01:26:29,115
Now come along, come along. You have it.

920
01:26:32,618 --> 01:26:35,740
You go then digest it there. Digest it.

921
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:39,339
Will you have this, first you eat that. Hm?

922
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:47,291
Oh. Take this, take this. Throw it away.

923
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:53,924
Now, just come here. Come, come, come.

924
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:59,581
Who is that? …

925
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:09,312
You all stand there… should not fall out.

926
01:27:13,579 --> 01:27:17,047
Elizabeth? Will you have some more?
