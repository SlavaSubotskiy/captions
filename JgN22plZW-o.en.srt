1
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,689
Today we are celebrating the day

2
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:08,082
which is a very, very important issue, absolutely

3
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:13,291
 the most important, we can say, day, when

4
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:18,497
 such a great happening took place.

5
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:24,357
And it had to take place that way

6
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,961
it was all in a way that strict.

7
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:45,487
In My last lectures I have told you

8
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:53,516
how Christ was created first in the heavens.

9
00:01:55,794 --> 00:02:00,080
In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that,

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,053
He was created as Mahavishnu

11
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:10,778
and is mentioned very clearly, that first

12
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,488
He was created as an egg.

13
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,614
It is written in this book,

14
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:22,438
which perhaps was written about 14,000 years back.

15
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,370
It’s a book that predicts about Christ,

16
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:34,846
and that is why people in the West, specially,

17
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,901
offer an egg to each other as a friend.

18
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:43,781
The first  existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ,

19
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:53,284
and part of it was kept in that stage

20
00:02:54,316 --> 00:03:02,166
and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost,

21
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:09,613
by Mahalakshmi, to create Christ out of it.

22
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,833
In that ancient book He was called as Mahavishnu;

23
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,892
means the greater form of Vishnu.

24
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,183
But actually Vishnu is the father

25
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:28,609
and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.

26
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,469
After my lecture I would like, if you have the book,

27
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:38,124
to read it out to them, the whole texts of how Christ was created.

28
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:47,532
And when He was created He cried for his Father,

29
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:54,439
as He cried also on the cross once.

30
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:59,017
And He cried for years.

31
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:08,716
And then Christ  in Mahavishnu state was blessed by His Father

32
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:13,141
who said that Your position will be placed higher than Mine

33
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,045
and You will be the Adhara; means the “Support of the Universe.”

34
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:23,331
See, how from Mooladhara He becomes the Adhara.

35
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,025
This was all done at the heavenly stage –

36
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:35,243
Vaikuntha stage you can say.

37
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:42,239
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost,

38
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:47,944
who was the mother of Christ on this Earth

39
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,708
who was nobody else but was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi;

40
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,854
means She was Radha. Ra-dha.

41
00:04:55,996 --> 00:05:00,204
“Ra” means energy, “dha” means the one who sustains energy.

42
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:09,890
There are many aspects of Easter one has to understand,

43
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:16,474
but the most of all is why did He die

44
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:18,784
and why was He resurrected?

45
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:23,772
This point I have not yet touched, perhaps, so clearly.

46
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,829
That’s the point I want to tell you today.

47
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:31,669
It’s only you people can understand the importance of the life of Christ.

48
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:36,608
And when it is said that you have to get

49
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:40,878
your realization through Christ,

50
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:46,395
it means that He had to pierce through the Agnya Chakra.

51
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,119
He had to be there.

52
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:54,787
If He had not created this gap in the gate

53
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,971
we could never have got realization.

54
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:03,918
That is why it is said that you are to pass through

55
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:12,666
the gates of heaven only with the grace of Christ.

56
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:17,419
Of course that doesn’t mean churches, it doesn’t mean at all churches.

57
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,018
That you understand as Sahaja Yogis

58
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,669
that you have to pass through the Agnya Chakra, ultimately

59
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,197
that’s the most difficult point where human beings have to pass.

60
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,472
Because, at the Agnya Chakra,

61
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,153
your ego and superego are fully grown.

62
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:38,163
At the human stage only this ego is developed.

63
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:42,282
Now how to overcome the ego was a point.

64
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:48,896
And to overcome the ego, Christ had to do this.

65
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:56,785
When He was created in the beginning as Shri Ganesha –

66
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:06,548
you know the story how He was created – that the mala

67
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:14,374
is the from the body of Parvati, the Holy Ghost,

68
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:21,607
was taken out because before Her marriage

69
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,666
She was –

70
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:31,350
She had to cover Herself for Her bath with many scented things.

71
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,271
And it was taken out, all these things

72
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,445
and Her vibrations came out.

73
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:41,279
And She created this child just to protect Her chastity;

74
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,682
outside Her bathroom She put him.

75
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,043
And you know the whole story about it.

76
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:53,328
Now there was a part of the element of the earth in that child.

77
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,214
pruthivee-tattwa, was there.

78
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,511
All other centers –

79
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:07,709
all other centers have got some elements in that.

80
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:14,998
Some elements like pruthivee-tattwa is there, earth element;

81
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,783
then you have got water element, then you have got air element,

82
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:26,261
and when you come to this it is the light element,

83
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,537
it’s the light.

84
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:34,666
And at this point, at Agnya Chakra,

85
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:41,849
He had to cross the last element, that was the light element.

86
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,552
That means He had to come out

87
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:52,360
into the true form of only the Divine Power, the Omkara,

88
00:08:52,785 --> 00:09:02,211
the vibrations you can call it; or the absolute…

89
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:07,717
you call it logos or something like that? The first sound, Brahma.

90
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:11,492
 So He had to become the principle of Brahma.

91
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:15,120
To become the principle of Brahma, He had to get rid of

92
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,466
all other elements within Him.

93
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,064
So the last was also the light element,

94
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,771
which He had to cross through.

95
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:29,755
So He had earth element in Him, as He was of the mala

96
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:35,229
and all other elements within Him. But when it comes to the Agnya,

97
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,264
He had to give up all the elements, that He had to die

98
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,157
the death of all these elements that were within Him,

99
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:46,740
to become complete, absolutely pure, Spirit.

100
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:54,599
What He did on subtle form works out on the gross form

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,170
and to do that He had to die.

102
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,631
And whatever died in Him,

103
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,116
was that little element of earth element and other elements,

104
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:12,037
and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

105
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,502
[UNCLEAR]

106
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:20,954
Was pure Spirit that was resurrected; the pure Spirit,

107
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:28,318
the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed the body of Christ,

108
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,608
which was the body of Christ.

109
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,786
And this happening came –

110
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,372
Christ has done what was predicted about Him –

111
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:53,609
that He’s a savior, because He passed through that gate

112
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:59,861
to take people from this bodily existence,

113
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:05,207
means the one that depends on the elements,

114
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:09,056
to that existence which is Spirit.

115
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:15,062
So the resurrection is where you become,

116
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,620
from your attention, you jump into the attention of the Spirit.

117
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:28,389
When you feel your attention, when you become the Spirit,

118
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:37,489
that is the happening which has happened to you also.

119
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:42,266
But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma Tattwa

120
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,862
when He was resurrected,

121
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:54,339
and the resurrection is a happening of the Divine Power

122
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:03,163
which came from Mooladhara Chakra as just earth element, [unclear]

123
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:06,679
started growing. It took its birth from there,

124
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:11,260
came up to Agnya chakra. There Christ was created

125
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,942
to pass through all the elements,

126
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:21,376
ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara

127
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,470
to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

128
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:31,969
And this was a very difficult thing,

129
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:38,817
was very experimental.

130
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:44,643
And the experiment was quite a dangerous one.

131
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,727
It could have failed also,

132
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:56,749
because He had in Him that human element,

133
00:12:57,088 --> 00:13:00,149
the body element which suffered.

134
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:07,634
And He suffered, because this body element suffers,

135
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,683
not the Spirit; Spirit does not suffer. The body element suffers.

136
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,758
So He had to suffer that body element

137
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,274
and to get over it, to get out of it,

138
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:34,735
and to get out of it He had to have a tremendous courage.

139
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:43,253
It was such a difficult operation.

140
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,217
Without Him nobody could have achieved.

141
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,284
He knew it was predestined,

142
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,058
but it was one of the most difficult things to happen.

143
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:04,441
I wonder how many Christians know the significance of an egg.

144
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:11,386
Now egg signifies a stage where you are before realization,

145
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,999
when you are in your egg shell;

146
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:20,287
that you are Mr. X; you are Mrs. Y; all that.

147
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:26,830
But when you mature fully inside the bird is ready

148
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,868
and that is the time you are hatched.

149
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:33,601
This is the time you get twice born.

150
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:39,189
So, actually the resurrection of Christ signifies that

151
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:45,206
and that’s why we give that egg to people saying,

152
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,363
“You are an egg,” a reminder of that,

153
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,808
“and this egg can become the spirit.”

154
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:56,376
And also it is written that it was an egg when He came.

155
00:14:56,714 --> 00:15:01,113
First He was created as an egg. Half of it remained

156
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:07,748
as Shri Ganesha and half of it became Mahavishnu.

157
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,519
Then He came on this earth

158
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:14,063
and He departed with all His elements

159
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,642
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

160
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:27,075
and He remained there within all of you to be awakened,

161
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:35,186
and when the Kundalini takes your attention through that point,

162
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,179
there you also become the Spirit.

163
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:45,148
That’s why He said, that “I am the gate, I am the door.”

164
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:49,174
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.” He said, “I’m the door,”

165
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,983
because you cannot become Christ.

166
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,005
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the destination,”

167
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,488
that you have to achieve Him,

168
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:02,339
but He has created this space for you.

169
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:08,582
You can become spiritually awakened;

170
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:14,830
you can become your Spirit. But Christ is an incarnation,

171
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:20,277
He was the Son of God. And so He’s an incarnation,

172
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,215
and that incarnation came on this earth

173
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,699
just to pull you out of your elements,

174
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,520
to make you become the Spirit.

175
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:37,958
Now how is it that it was the most difficult thing?

176
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:43,678
Because human beings had created in their heads

177
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:48,603
all kinds of artificial barriers; you see whatever we think

178
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,540
and whatever we do with our mind is all dead,

179
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,813
 is man made, is artificial,

180
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:57,947
Because reality’s beyond your mind;

181
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,994
it is not in your mind. You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

182
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:08,248
Whatever is in your mind is not the reality, it is beyond.

183
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:14,489
So, for a human being to accept something that is beyond mind

184
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,147
had become so difficult at the time of Christ because of Romans

185
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,910
and all these people coming up.

186
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,738
And we are repeating the history again.

187
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:27,314
They were so ego-oriented, they were so full of ego

188
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,565
that to destroy their ego

189
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:36,061
somebody had to do this to create a passage.

190
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,576
By His death so many things are proved,

191
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,067
that all those who crucified Him were stupid people,

192
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:47,621
they were ego-oriented, they were blind.

193
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:50,600
They could not see what He was.

194
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,629
They could not see what a genuine personality He was.

195
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:59,903
They crucified Him.

196
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,446
I mean it’s the greatest stupidity.

197
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,276
And they crucified Him, it was all known because these people

198
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:13,238
were so stupid that they would have only crucified him,

199
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,901
what else they could do?

200
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,294
Because they couldn’t bear with their little egos,

201
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:22,919
somebody who is so simple, who is so genuine, who is so true.

202
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,677
So they crucified Him

203
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:31,428
and that crucifixion came as a breakthrough for us.

204
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,579
But message for us is the resurrection part.

205
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:40,451
Message for us is the resurrection and not crucifixion.

206
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,443
Crucifixion is not the message, because He’s done for us.

207
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:50,193
This is the point where Jews must understand.

208
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:55,701
The other day I was reading – today only –

209
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:03,396
some discussion with the Archbishop of Canterbury took place.

210
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:08,276
And the fellow who was asking him was asking him questions

211
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:12,198
as if he was asking questions to God.

212
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,653
In a way he said so also that, “I would ask this question to God,

213
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,999
that, ‘Why is it so many Jews were killed?’”

214
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,088
They asked for it.

215
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:29,582
They wanted that they must suffer

216
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,671
because they wouldn’t give the credit of suffering to Christ.

217
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:36,840
They thought, "We all have to suffer." Ego. It's ego.

218
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,251
"How dare anybody suffer for us? We must suffer separately."

219
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,015
They couldn't give that credit to Christ and all the

220
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,602
later thinking was that, "We must suffer."

221
00:19:52,949 --> 00:20:01,167
So, whatever you think comes into action on this gross level,

222
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:05,750
so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them suffer.

223
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:15,088
And the stupidity of human beings

224
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,084
is responsible for all the problems

225
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,518
that are created on this earth.

226
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:26,353
The other question was, "How the children get leukemia?"

227
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,423
He would ask God, "How children get it?"

228
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:32,913
If the parents are so frantic and speedy, children have to get it.

229
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:40,094
If you are not relaxed person when you are married

230
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,552
and when you are going to have a baby;

231
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,485
you are thinking of divorces and all sorts of nonsense,

232
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,107
that franticness will work on the child.

233
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:51,416
Psychologically it is a left side problem and the child has to be

234
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,700
a patient of leukemia as soon as he's born.

235
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,560
That is what it is.

236
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:08,081
So the problems are created by human beings

237
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,471
because of their stupidity.

238
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:13,862
There is no problem that God has created for you.

239
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:17,526
He's solved all your problems. All your problems He solves;

240
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:19,016
you have seen in Sahaj Yoga

241
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,686
how He solves your little, little problems even.

242
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:27,215
But we create problem for ourselves by our stupidity,

243
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:31,355
by our addiction to elements,

244
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:36,567
to material things,

245
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,633
to material habits. Matter sits on our head.

246
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:56,593
That is on the, we can say, on the level of the earth element.

247
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:03,554
Then we have other problems like emotional attachments:

248
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:07,992
"This is my daughter; this is my child; this my; this is mine;

249
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:10,953
I'm so attached to my child."

250
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:18,479
Then, "This is my country. This is your country."

251
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:21,589
We create problem. This Falkland camp...

252
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:26,804
this Falkland this thing is an artificial problem, you can see that.

253
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,997
I mean, when these people went there, these spaniards,

254
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:32,803
They all should been given back to Spain.

255
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:37,588
And all from Brasil should be given back to Portugal.

256
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,027
What are they doing there? If this is the situation.

257
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,326
But they are all human beings.

258
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,475
What is this territory business?

259
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:50,020
So let the human beings live happily wherever they are.

260
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,897
What are they going to get out of this territory?

261
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:57,386
God never created Argentina, Chile, England and all that,

262
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:00,806
He created one homogeneous structure,

263
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:05,149
and it is to look after each other. Like a heart is created,

264
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,399
a liver is created, a brain is created, a nose is created.

265
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:14,070
If they start fighting, say this eye starts fighting this eye.

266
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:19,307
We laugh, but we human beings do the same thing.

267
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,316
We are all the time doing like this.

268
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:29,101
This is the stupidity of human beings, which is creating problem.

269
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,952
And when you become very stupid,

270
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,496
somebody horrible takes advantage of that

271
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:38,760
and comes on this earth just like Hitler,

272
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:42,583
and he tries to put you right.

273
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,837
You don't need all that. You need only wisdom

274
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:49,621
and your realization.

275
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:54,012
And that is what is done today that you have got realization.

276
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:57,137
So Easter for Sahaj Yogis all over the world,

277
00:23:57,337 --> 00:24:00,753
is the most important happening

278
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:04,878
because if it had not happened it would not have been possible

279
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,424
to give realization to people.

280
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:15,652
I think Gavin will read it out to you later on about

281
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:18,290
what is written about Christ in Devi Mahatmya.

282
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:22,794
This book was written about 14,000 years back by Markandeya.

283
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:27,485
So imagine 14,000 years back he knew, being a seer,

284
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,889
just like Blake, what was going to happen

285
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,689
when Christ was to come.

286
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,564
But He was called as Mahavishnu.

287
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:39,359
He was not Vishnu, He was the son of Vishnu.

288
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:48,756
And how many Christians understand this about Easter.

289
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,885
They don't. They - It's -

290
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,916
Christianity today is nothing but a mental activity that's all,

291
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:57,033
which is dead; nonsense it is.

292
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,197
Just like any other nonsensical religion,

293
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:02,809
it has become another foolish, stupid religion,

294
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,979
which has no meaning. Unless and until you get your realization,

295
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,213
unless and until you feel the vibrations,

296
00:25:08,414 --> 00:25:11,307
unless and until you feel this Divine Surrounding Power,

297
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,102
how will you understand?

298
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,204
Because that's the only thing that is truth;

299
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:18,259
that's the only thing that is reality,

300
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,634
and unless and until you achieve it, how will you know about Christ?

301
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:25,634
And fighting about Him; how can you fight?

302
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,306
I can't understand really.

303
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:31,939
To Me, it's stupidity gone to another extreme.

304
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:36,601
By this thing, what you do actually,

305
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:40,095
is to use all these great incarnations to kill each other.

306
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:44,712
Can you imagine? The things that came to elevate you,

307
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:48,079
to make you into higher living are now used,

308
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,688
the same things, the names are used to kill each other,

309
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:54,813
to bring down each other. At the most,

310
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,086
if you reach a point where you don't understand,

311
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,724
then they start saying, "It's a mystery."

312
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:04,078
What is the mystery, in Sahaj Yoga there's no mystery.

313
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,595
It's all just there.

314
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,501
To Me, human beings are a mystery.

315
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:17,760
I don't understand them. I can't understand.

316
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:25,014
The resurrection of Christ has to now be collective resurrection.

317
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:32,832
This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be the collective resurrection

318
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:35,466
and for this collective resurrection,

319
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:39,758
first of all Sahaj Yogis must decide to be collective.

320
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,709
Because through Kundalini awakening you cross,

321
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,662
no doubt, you cross through,

322
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:52,090
but you enter an area of collectivity.

323
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:58,281
And if you do not allow that collectivy to permeate into you,

324
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:00,983
then you come down.

325
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:06,803
Supposing you become a state beyond the element,

326
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:10,312
the state where you are a collective being;

327
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,224
you're aware of the collective being;

328
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,794
you're aware that you are a part and parcel of the whole;

329
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:21,645
you're aware that you have to help your nose and your eyes

330
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:23,918
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

331
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,943
You reach that stage where you understand that,

332
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,994
"I am as important as other cells are,

333
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:32,216
and other cells are to be helped by me

334
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,018
and they have to sustain me, we are one."

335
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,147
There should be complete concord.

336
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,675
This awareness comes after realization

337
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:44,357
and if you do not understand that this awareness,

338
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,300
that this collective awareness

339
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,503
is the only way you can stay in that area.

340
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,977
Otherwise you get out.

341
00:27:53,390 --> 00:28:01,349
You start having your smaller wells and you just go down into them.

342
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:09,321
The more you start to expand yourself, you rise higher

343
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:14,229
and then you are again with your badhas or whatever it is.

344
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:19,019
But if you think that, "I have to live for the whole.

345
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,550
I'm responsible for the whole.

346
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:29,347
I'm responsible for creating a nucleus of a cell,

347
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,408
which is going to look after the whole,

348
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,431
and if I fall down the rest also suffers.

349
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,423
I have no business to fall down

350
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:40,837
because I have been resurrected to this point.

351
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,595
I have entered into the state of collectivity,

352
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:48,345
where my being, which is the Spirit,

353
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:51,939
is the collective being and I have to stay there,

354
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:58,219
I have to be there; I cannot fall, it's not the way I can live."

355
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,733
But I have seen after realization also,

356
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:06,600
people cannot get out of their shells.
They still remain in the shell.

357
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:11,756
They cannot spread their wings and sing

358
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:17,967
and get out of their shell and just fly. They cannot do it.

359
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,651
They still stick on to their small ways of life,

360
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:26,457
in a smaller ways, in every way. In a holiday you go.

361
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:29,440
You want to have a separate holiday. Why?

362
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,573
This is the holiday time, holy-day as they say. Holy day.

363
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,022
This is the holy-day. When you are with other Sahaja Yogis

364
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:40,624
you are really enjoying a holiday.

365
00:29:40,825 --> 00:29:44,444
Where do you enjoy your holiday otherwise? Which is the other way?

366
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:47,732
To be with them is the real holiday.

367
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,397
And that is why one should understand

368
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,049
that you should expand your collectivity.

369
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,280
If you do not expand your collectivity you are just a waste.

370
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:02,734
You are a wasteful creation of Sahaj Yogis,

371
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:06,081
which I'm sorry to say, will go down.

372
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:09,154
Such people show also, in the beginning,

373
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,227
gradually they start getting better and better and better.

374
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,704
And once you are there in full state

375
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:17,316
you really enjoy each other's company

376
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:19,191
without having any fears about them,

377
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:21,552
without having any possessiveness about them,

378
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,055
without having any kind of expectation,

379
00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:27,361
but just enjoying each other.

380
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:34,131
That has to happen. Lies... All our cells in our body are like that.

381
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,281
If they can do it, why not we?

382
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,963
Because we have so much of sense;

383
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:45,971
at least we think we have more sense than the cells have.

384
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:49,073
At least it is expected, because we have evolved so much

385
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,898
from unicell to this state.

386
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,448
And then you are the epitome of God's creation;

387
00:30:56,632 --> 00:31:00,025
you are the topmost people. Then why not?

388
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:03,407
When you are resurrected the first thing that should happen to you

389
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:07,188
is to understand that you are no more an individual,

390
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:11,461
but you are a collective being. You are no more an individual.

391
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:18,234
All things which make you circumcise your individuality -

392
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,086
throw that away.

393
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,620
You're no more an individual. All problems which come to you

394
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:33,253
as individual problems are absolutely useless, false, wasteful.

395
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:39,280
Think of the collective problems. I enjoy such people.

396
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:44,843
Like the other day Fergie was anxious to know about Bristol -

397
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:46,452
which points are there,

398
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:50,261
which are giving vibrations from the Mother Earth.

399
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:53,562
He's worried about the whole of Bristol - all the Jamaicans,

400
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:58,206
then about the whole British people,

401
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:01,179
and then of the whole world you should be.

402
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,351
That's what one should think. One should not think,

403
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:06,617
"How will my daughter get married?

404
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:08,914
How can I get a ticket to go there?"

405
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:11,656
All these nonsensical ideas should be given up

406
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:14,859
because you are now entered into the Kingdom of God

407
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,443
and He's going to look after you.

408
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:20,461
Because that state you establish within yourself

409
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:23,055
that you are a collective being.

410
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,008
All other things will drop out.

411
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,797
Gradually everybody will be molded.

412
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:31,547
Even the most difficult I have seen, have improved.

413
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:35,328
But what about you, the one who is improving everybody else,

414
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:38,336
what about you? How far you are there?

415
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:41,555
How far in your faith that you know that,

416
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:44,883
"I have entered into the Kingdom of God

417
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:51,203
and that every action mine is looked after and guided by His power

418
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:52,556
and I'm aware of it.

419
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,476
I'm aware that I have entered into the Kingdom of God

420
00:32:56,677 --> 00:32:59,157
which is expressed through my collectivity."

421
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:03,803
So collectivity is the nature of a Sahaj Yogi.

422
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:08,414
And that's what one has to realize.

423
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:12,217
May God bless you.

424
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:17,477
Is it all right now? Just time.

425
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,461
How I manage, without looking at the watch?
