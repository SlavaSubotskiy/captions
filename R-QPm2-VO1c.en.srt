1
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,159
Today, we have decided to

2
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:50,159
worship the Yogeshwara. I think that is the 
greatest name of Shri Krishna for us. That

3
00:03:50,159 --> 00:04:01,890
means He is the Ishwara of yoga. Yoga means 
the union ,as you know, with the divine. But

4
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,209
also yoga has another meaning which means 
yukti. In English language to translate it

5
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:25,020
properly is not possible. Yukti means the 
trick. but trick is always connected with

6
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,500
something funny and bad. But this 'yukti' 
means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

7
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:41,180
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'. 
But one can say that: to know the technique

8
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:48,830
and the trick of the technique is also another 
meaning of yoga - yukti.

9
00:04:48,830 --> 00:05:00,490
So, even if you are connected, if you do not 
know the trick of the union then it is useless,

10
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:12,840
it is of no avail. So what one has to learn, 
after getting realization, is not only the

11
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:22,840
technique but the trick of the technique. 
At Krishna's level when we reach - it is an

12
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:32,370
incarnation after Shri Rama's. So Shri Rama 
came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

13
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:49,389
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas 
and a benevolent king.

14
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:58,180
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different 
phase because people had become extremely

15
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:11,110
serious, very disciplined, and were leading 
a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

16
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:23,210
And this had put the people at a level, fixed, 
and they thought that "If we are doing all

17
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:30,080
these things every day then it's alright. 
We have reached the last." So Shri Krishna

18
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:42,039
had to come - Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as 
Shri Krishna - to tell us about the ascent,

19
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:55,120
and that - all this is just a play. But only 
a person who is a master of the play can do

20
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
the play.

21
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:07,490
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication, 
you have electrical communications. Now you

22
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:17,930
don't know how to play with it - play. Not 
how to know or how to connect but to play.

23
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:27,780
Supposing only you know all the technique, 
then it becomes quite a headache, because

24
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,889
all the time you think you are doing it. You 
have to do this and, this is to be done, that

25
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,169
has to be done, and this connection is not 
all right; that should be properly connected.

26
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:49,919
You get tired and bored. But if it's a play 
for you, just a play. For any master it's

27
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,180
a play.

28
00:07:52,180 --> 00:08:00,500
If it's just a play for you, then you don't 
feel tired - it's fun, it's fun. And that

29
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,090
is what is Leela, that's why He is called 
'Leeladhara' - because He is a master. He

30
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:23,949
came as a master, master not as a guru, but 
master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

31
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:38,490
So He is so deft, He's so capable, that for 
Him it's a play. All this is a play for Him.

32
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:46,640
And this is what one has to know, that, in 
yoga, everything that you do should be just

33
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:55,940
a play. Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the 
morning, should be a play.

34
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:11,060
In the morning you get up. The sun has not 
yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

35
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:19,279
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight 
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very

36
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:28,810
beautiful. And at that time you sit down for 
your dhyaan. But it's not a serious thing,

37
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:39,490
it's not something that is boring, it's a 
play. But for that you have to be a master.

38
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:47,420
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a 
play. So first Shri Rama's state has to be

39
00:09:47,420 --> 00:10:01,940
there where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala 
Dharmi - so that it becomes your play.

40
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:12,680
Now communication with the Divine has to go 
to the whole world. The whole world has to

41
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:23,769
get this communication that you have received. 
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

42
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:37,490
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a 
child. It looks, very childlike. Like when

43
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:44,089
the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid 
their clothes - I mean, Indian women are never

44
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:52,750
fully nude, never - He hid their saris and 
all that and He could see their back, this

45
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:02,130
little boy. What is for a little boy? He's 
sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their

46
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:09,950
Kundalini. They're coming out of the river 
Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha. Already

47
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,269
there are vibrations, you see - raising their 
Kundalini.

48
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:25,529
Then they are taking the water and He breaks 
their pitchers, from the back, which have

49
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:32,550
also got vibrated water in. So the vibrated 
water falls on the backs of these ladies and

50
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:47,940
He tries to awaken their Kundalini. See the 
play of a child, how He tried to play in His

51
00:11:47,940 --> 00:12:01,399
childhood, just like a child. And then He 
shows, later on, His child-like expertise

52
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:09,529
in dealing with politics, dealing with people, 
with communication and everything. And His

53
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:17,220
power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' . 'Ra' means 
energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains

54
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,029
- 'Ra-dha'. So the "Dha Re Di Dha Sa Ma" (???) as 
they say. In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha'

55
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,889
- the one who sustains the energy.

56
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:34,670
So the first quality that He got from Her 
is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'. I couldn't

57
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:43,230
find a word in English for 'Alaahd'. 'Alaahd' 
is when you suddenly see something nice and

58
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,980
joy starts. Just feel very happy. I mean, 
there are very few words in English, as you

59
00:12:49,980 --> 00:13:04,860
know, for joy or at the most happiness. But 
'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which, as you

60
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,740
get the fresh air - then how you feel. That 
is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'. She's

61
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,639
the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

62
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:25,410
And so with Her powers, He could work out 
this Alaahd to all the people with whom He

63
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:33,160
was connected. So all the Gopas and Gopis 
who were with Him had to do Rasa. 'Ra' is

64
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,579
'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'. To dance with 
the energy that is Radhaji. He used to just

65
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:48,610
play the flute and She used to dance, the 
energy used to pass through Her hands to all

66
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:58,110
the other people and the Kundalini would be 
awakened. So this was another play that He

67
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:09,839
had. So in the play only He raised the Kundalini. 
But in modern times it's very difficult, it

68
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:22,339
is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern 
times in that way. I mean, nobody will understand

69
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,829
also.

70
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:34,370
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not 
just raising the Kundalini but giving the

71
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:43,510
complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga and also 
empowering the person with the power to give

72
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:51,490
others realization, it was tremendous task. 
And that's why we had to find out these methods

73
00:14:51,490 --> 00:15:01,420
by which we could give realization to people. 
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but

74
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,589
the Sahasrara was not broken. So Kundalini 
must be somewhere hanging in the agnya, maybe

75
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:18,430
at heart, maybe somewhere. And such people 
became the seekers and that's how we find,

76
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,839
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose 
Sahasrara's are open and they know all the

77
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,019
yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:38,699
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of 
Sahaja Yoga which you have to master. The

79
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:50,490
first is that His character was 'madhuriya', 
meaning the sweetness. Sweetness. We always

80
00:15:50,490 --> 00:16:04,680
say, "He's sweet like honey". So when He talked 
to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

81
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:20,209
it was through sweetness; and this communication, 
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere

82
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:35,120
near Yoga. To talk to someone sweetly, automatically. 
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

83
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:44,329
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

84
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,639
So when we talk of communications first of 
all the greatest thing is the communication

85
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:59,339
between human beings and when we have to think 
of the communication with the human beings

86
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:09,360
many people think that by aggression you will 
communicate better, which is not true. I mean

87
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,260
if somebody wants to get something out of 
someone, say; so you go there and just talk,

88
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:27,480
"I have to have! How can you do it? This, 
that!" As it is - it's no good. But if you

89
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:41,320
are sweet and start talking sweetly then 99% 
will definitely dissolve. So to dissolve people

90
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:57,010
with sweetness - how to do it - that trick 
one has to learn: how, with sweetness, you

91
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:06,890
can dissolve people. This is one of His special 
qualities, that you talk to someone in such

92
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:20,960
a manner, genuinely, in a very sweet manner, 
and the problem between you and that person

93
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,940
will be dissolved, absolutely.

94
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:33,030
Now there are many tricks and how to talk 
to someone is one of the biggest things one

95
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:39,340
has to learn. First of all you must always 
show that you are less intelligent than another

96
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:53,539
person. Like if I'm talking to a scientist 
I will say, "I'm sorry I don't know any science

97
00:18:53,539 --> 00:19:10,919
you know. I'm no good for a scientist." So 
they feel "ahhhh, very good." If you have

98
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:19,820
to talk to some musician, you must say "I 
don't know any music. No, I just have learned

99
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,539
a little bit, but not much." Musician feels 
very happy. You may call it a pampering of

100
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:34,720
the ego. You may call it [that]. But there's 
no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared

101
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,630
to you".

102
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:47,919
So the first trick is complete humility when 
you talk to another person. It's the sign

103
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:56,110
of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment. 
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits

104
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:08,070
they bend down. So, first of all, if you say 
"I am no one. I don't understand anything

105
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:18,470
but I would like to hear" this is first. The 
first quality of communication is to be extremely

106
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:28,580
humble about yourself. The other person should 
not know who you are. And there's a lot of

107
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:38,049
fun in it. Say for example now - I can say 
about Myself that My husband was very highly

108
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:50,480
placed in India. But I met a friend in Delhi 
- she was studying with Me in school and in

109
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,850
college - and She asked Me "where do you live?" 
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

110
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,960
just a useless, small, little place meant 
for very ordinary officers because they had

111
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,880
not allotted us any house or anything so, 
temporarily, we were there. She said "what?

112
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,220
What is your husband doing?" I said "He's 
some governments servant." I didn't tell her

113
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,720
[his position]! He came down, so he just looked 
at Me and he smiled. She said "do you know

114
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:25,870
him?" I said "He's My husband". She was shocked, 
"He's your husband? Oh my God! Why didn't

115
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:33,470
you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing 
changed and she felt so ashamed of herself.

116
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:43,789
She had started looking down upon Me, "Ah, 
Married to some clerk or someone."

117
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:54,669
So the best thing is to play down. Play down 
everything. Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis

118
00:21:54,669 --> 00:22:01,659
they say, "oh Mother has giving me such powers. 
I can do this, I can do that." This boastfullness

119
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:07,890
is of no use. "I haven't got any powers you 
see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all. But

120
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:27,929
if you want I can try." So play down as much 
as you can. Practice this at home, first practice

121
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:36,570
and then do it. So that is one of the greatest 
qualities of communication with others.

122
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,350
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, 
if you read it, there's one is very important

123
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,650
thing. He says " "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah" 
[ The actual Gita quote is - "kaamaat krodho'bhijaayate,

124
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,809
Krodhaad bhavati sammohah" - from desire comes 
anger, from anger comes delusion (Gita 2:61)].

125
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:59,400
You see among all the worst things that we 
have - according to Him we have six enemies.

126
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:09,559
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'. He said 
- it starts with Krodha, means anger.

127
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:17,049
If you have anger within you then you are 
not a master at all. There's no need for a

128
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:25,929
master to get angry because he can play about. 
He can make you dance like this. What is the

129
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:34,990
need to lose your temper? But that mastery 
if you don't have, of handling people, then

130
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:42,960
after five/six minutes of talk your voice 
starts raising and something starts barking

131
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,240
- because that temper is still inside you, 
burning.

132
00:23:50,240 --> 00:24:01,710
But for a master there should be no temper 
- no need. He has started with Krodha, that:

133
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,900
with the Krodha all problems start - from 
one to another to another to another.

134
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:21,920
So we should watch out if we are angry people. 
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver

135
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:30,360
- Vishnu - but is expressed through Vishuddhi. 
The face becomes red, eyes become red. From

136
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,970
the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible 
things and the whole expression becomes so

137
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,820
different when you are angry.

138
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,080
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it 
within us? Where is it this anger? Liver?

139
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
alright, I'll put it right."

140
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,470
So to master it you have to face yourself 
clearly. Many people I have seen people say

141
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,590
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered 
women, she is so dominating. She does this,

142
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,200
she does that." But if you tell her she says, 
"No no, I don't do that way. No, no I'm very

143
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,770
good." "But how other's saying that?", "I 
don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

144
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:24,039
If somebody is saying that then you watch 
yourself - do you get into tempers or not?

145
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:30,140
Are you loosing your temper? It's very easy 
to make it out then face it. So the trick

146
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:39,340
of the trade is to face yourself and see for 
yourself how much you are lacking. So first

147
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:51,799
is humility, which should be genuine, and 
secondly is equanimity - no temper. There

148
00:25:51,799 --> 00:26:00,470
is no need to take to temper. At the most 
you can say "What are you doing? Why are you

149
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,679
doing that way?" Now if you do something, 
you know, maybe something I might say which

150
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:10,730
I would not like, so I don't want to say." 
Like that - at the most! Up to that point

151
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:20,330
is alright; that you should say that, "I dislike 
it", but not to go further with it.

152
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:31,029
If you just stop at a point, then this habit 
of getting into temper will go away. This

153
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:38,169
arrogance will go away, which has to go. This 
arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

154
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:45,150
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel 
very much relieved. Because this anger, once

155
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,669
it comes in, reacts, and catches your left 
Vishuddi, and you become guilty, you feel

156
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:59,960
very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have 
said this." So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi,

157
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:07,500
means - it's a headache. It goes on accumulating 
like a store house there - all your anger,

158
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,110
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi 
catches, and you know the problems of left

159
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,600
Vishuddhi.

160
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:26,970
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel 
guilty but go before the mirror and slap yourself

161
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:34,590
nicely, twice. Now you get angry with yourself, 
"let me get angry!" Then stand before the

162
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,630
mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" [Mother pretends 
to punch herself! Everybody laughs], like

163
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:47,830
that. In the same manner as you get angry 
try to act, you'll never feel guilty. Or maybe

164
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:56,159
more angry - would be better. So you empty 
out your left Vishuddhi. Next time you won't

165
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,809
do it. But feeling guilty means you will repeat 
and repeat and repeat the same thing.

166
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:12,549
So this temper is expressed by men and women 
differently. And I'm very much worried about

167
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:19,500
the women sometimes because they take to water 
power - then I'm lost. But those who have

168
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,970
ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign, 
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately

169
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:35,779
they start crying, because already the left 
Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

170
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:41,669
and when you touch them it becomes water.

171
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:47,960
But men, their temper is a different style, 
as you know very well, that: when they get

172
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,630
angry they might fight with each other, box 
everyone and then settle down nicely and have

173
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:03,880
something to drink. "Let us have it out!" 
you see, they'll say. Take out. But women

174
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,110
don't, they keep it there and once they keep 
it then it becomes tears, it starts coming

175
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:17,470
down. So, if these are just tears out of joy, 
happiness, that's different, or out of feelings

176
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,330
for others - but it is not that, but it's 
tears just to impress another person that

177
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:37,120
you are very sad or something.

178
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:46,820
So the second trick is how to master your 
own temper and the third one is how to master

179
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:58,450
the temper of others - that's even better. 
I don't know if I have told you the trick

180
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,240
of Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him. He 
is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

181
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,600
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he 
was feeling hot so he was sitting in the water

182
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,380
all the time, so his feet are useless and 
he goes on a tiger, they say. I never saw

183
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,200
the tiger, of course. But he knows about Me 
and all that and he told everyone about Me

184
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:30,059
so I went to see him. And he's supposed to 
control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

185
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:35,279
for about one and a half hours. And as soon 
as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

186
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,190
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't 
stop it, so he felt very challenged! When

187
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:48,570
I went up he was sitting on his own stone 
outside the cave, and he was doing like this

188
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,789
[twisting his head], with anger. He didn't 
know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

189
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:59,419
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he 
came, they brought him. He touched my feet,

190
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:05,059
everything he did and then he said, "You tell 
me now - why did you not allow me to stop

191
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:12,220
the water? You got completely drenched. I'm 
very angry with this rain I know. But why

192
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,620
did you do that? Is it to control my ego?" 
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had

193
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:30,010
ego or anything," "Then why?" So - because 
I'm a master as you know - I said "You see

194
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:36,779
you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for 
Me, that too of an orange colour, and I would

195
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:40,350
not take the orange colour sari from you. 
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a

196
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:48,919
sanyasi. But I had to get drenched to get 
the sari, isn't it?" Immediately - he melted

197
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:50,120
away.

198
00:31:50,120 --> 00:32:03,700
But I had to be the master. First of all how 
to melt him and secondly the master of his

199
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:14,830
mind. This is the subtler part of it. You 
can be a master of a person. Like that you

200
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:22,070
can know what he has done for you, what he 
has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

201
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:28,769
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole 
future. But if you try just to know about

202
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:36,769
a person - you can know everything about that 
person, very simple. So first try to understand

203
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,929
a person.

204
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:49,899
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know, 
and a very humorous person. And one day My

205
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:56,659
brother told me, Babamama, that he has a friend 
who sings very well. So I asked my father

206
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:03,340
"How does he sing?" "Oh, he is very courageous," 
he said. I said "Why?" "He sings whether he

207
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,320
knows or not - that's the trouble!" What an 
exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

208
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,380
"He's very courageous you see. He doesn't 
know but he sings - quite alright, so he's

209
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,190
very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything 
against him - he said "He's courageous" - but

210
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,779
he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman 
that: "You have to be careful you see, he

211
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:31,190
might start singing in a funny way, you shouldn't 
laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous'

212
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,110
word.

213
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:44,799
In the same way, if you study someone then 
you will just describe that person in an interesting

214
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,750
way, and you will not feel that this person 
has these bad habits or those bad habits or

215
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:58,529
this is wrong with him, that is wrong, but 
you'll describe - it's part of that person.

216
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:05,890
It's a way of knowing a person in totality 
with all his defects, with all his qualities,

217
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:11,710
with everything and accepting that person 
as he is.

218
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:19,990
If that mastery you can have. Now how will 
you have? If your attention is not on his

219
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:30,070
qualities you'll only know his bad things. 
And if you know his qualities then bad things

220
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:36,159
will be there, a little bit, but they'll just 
be adding a little masala to his character.

221
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:49,659
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he 
is a little bit like that." Little additional

222
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,839
swara (musical note) is added to his character. 
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person.

223
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:55,000
You'll really enjoy.

224
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,440
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs and 
his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's

225
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,070
a flat. So there is a fight between them for 
the dog. So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

226
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:14,750
I said "This is not proper but next time I 
have decided to be a dog," Immediately he

227
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,400
took the point, you see.

228
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,510
So the way you talk to a person you can suggest 
to him what is so special about that person

229
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:34,990
or the defects of that person. But you need 
not say directly something to him. If you

230
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:47,540
say indirectly, in such a humorous manner 
that the person will understand. So in communication

231
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:56,890
with others you have to be a very humorous 
person. But mostly I've seen people have humour

232
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:03,060
if somebody cannot walk straight. If a physical 
problem is there they'll laugh. If he has

233
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,109
not properly made his hair then they will 
laugh. On some sort of a very superficial

234
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:17,450
thing they laugh. This is not humorous. This 
is some sort of a criticism in laughter. Or

235
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:25,660
some people have a humour like this that they 
say sarcastic things, that's no good. You

236
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:32,829
say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think 
you are brilliant, but you are lost forever

237
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:38,020
for that person. That person will remember 
"He said such a such things to me."

238
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,980
So sarcasm is against you completely; against 
Sahaja Yoga. If you have to say something,

239
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:56,540
say it in such a manner that it doesn't hurt 
the person, and the person enjoys that subtle

240
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:12,560
humour and understands also that "This is 
the problem with me". Now in a humorous way,

241
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,500
if I have to tell something to you - I need 
not tell you directly, "You are like this,

242
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:26,020
you are like that," but I'll say, "There was 
one crow which came to my house..." and, like

243
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,910
that, I can transfer all your qualities to 
that crow and describe to you and say that,

244
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:37,980
"This crow did like this and did that." Immediately 
you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother

245
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,480
was saying or about the crow?"

246
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,790
So transfer it to somebody else. Transfer 
it to somebody else, that's the best way.

247
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,650
For example, if you want to say that: all 
the names of the people who are coming to

248
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:01,730
the puja should be there at the right time. 
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

249
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,670
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." 
- they have not - "...have sent the word that

250
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:13,690
all the names should be there." No harm telling 
such lies, no harm. So that people will not

251
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,110
put it on you, they'll not be angry with you. 
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans

252
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:25,359
- doesn't matter, for the time being. So transfer 
it. And this transference is 'astantar' as

253
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:38,079
they call it. To transfer from one hand to 
another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

254
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:46,960
There is a story about Him. He is called as 
Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

255
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:55,990
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?" The 
reason was like this: there was a very bad

256
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:05,290
rakshasa who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva 
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome

257
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:11,130
that, nobody knew, and He was killing so many 
people. So He thought of a trick, transfer

258
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:21,369
it to somebody else. He knew of another great 
yogi you see, special type, who has meditated

259
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:31,589
and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva 
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs

260
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:38,799
my sleep and, if I open my eyes and look at 
that person, that person should become ashes

261
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,619
- bhasma (ashes)."

262
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:48,800
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer 
the job from me to Him." So He started running

263
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:57,550
away from the field. So this Rakshasa also 
followed Him. Then Shri Krishna stealthily

264
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:10,710
went into the cave of this avadhuta, and put 
His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

265
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:18,240
and hid himself in the cave. Now this Rakshasa 
came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna

266
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,329
who was sleeping, "Ahhh now you are tired, 
you are sleeping. Now I'm going to see how

267
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:30,410
you can save yourself." And he started waking 
[him] up. This avadhuta got up and looked

268
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,130
at him and he became bhasma.

269
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:46,960
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri 
Mataji laughs) person who can do this better,

270
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,220
than taking upon yourself straight-forward, 
going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with

271
00:40:52,220 --> 00:41:01,349
you" - you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare 
as you call it. Transfer it, and you can transfer

272
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:08,829
it to somebody, you can make friends with 
that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

273
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:16,800
But the main point is that you should get 
rid of the ills, the bad, the rakshasas. So

274
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,599
you can transfer it to anyone.

275
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:41,500
And so many tricks He played. In the Mahabharata, 
Bhishma had a blessing that, unless and until

276
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:59,050
he wants to die, nobody can kill him. So Shri 
Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

277
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:10,640
So He told Arjuna that you put him...He told 
Arjuna not himself; He was just doing the

278
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:21,750
chariot drivers job - Sarathi. So Krishna 
told him that you just make him sleep on the

279
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:32,760
arrows, let His body be on the arrows and 
he has to decide that he will die. But Dronacharya

280
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:45,810
was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was 
siding with Kauravas. Now how can you kill

281
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:57,430
this Dhronacharya, big problem. Because you 
see, he knew all the tricks of archery. How

282
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:06,960
are you going to save them? Because archery 
is such a thing that he was the master of

283
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,260
archery, while Arjuna was his disciple.

284
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:40,520
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows 
of Arjuna? How to do that, that he doesn't

285
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:51,990
answer back? Because he was a master. So Krishna 
organized it, in a very special way. He got

286
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:59,950
a Shikhandi, a eunuch. What is the advantage 
of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

287
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:11,940
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him 
in front of Arjuna. A eunuch in India is regarded

288
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:25,770
as a woman, so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot 
kill a woman," and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

289
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:34,980
So [He played] these tricks, because to get 
rid of ill is the main thing. To get rid of

290
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,140
the ill - if you are not capable - you better 
tell somebody else to get rid. Because that

291
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:48,020
is very important - to get rid of the evil 
- and if you can transfer this to somebody

292
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:53,619
else who is more capable, in your own humility, 
you'll do much better than to directly attack

293
00:44:53,619 --> 00:45:00,119
that person. That's Tomfoolery. No use.

294
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:07,180
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout, 
if you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna

295
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:17,609
told Arjuna that, "Either you can the have 
all of My army or you can have Me." Same He

296
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,560
told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll 
have your army." But he (Arjuna) said, "You

297
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:27,200
will be mine, Krishna." He said "You'll be 
on our side." But He said, "No, I'll be just

298
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,760
on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon." 
But He is a master of tricks. He does not

299
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:41,280
need any weapons with Him. Without weapons 
also He can do everything. So Arjuna said,

300
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,270
"alright, You be my chariot driver," and He 
was there.

301
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:58,020
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every 
thing, mostly He used to smile. Now, if somebody's

302
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:04,500
telling Me something, sometimes you will find 
I also smile, but I try to control because

303
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:11,089
I don't want them to see. But I know what 
they are doing, what they're up to, what is

304
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:16,640
their trick. Because you are such a trick 
master you know all the tricks and you know

305
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,630
what they are playing with you. So you just 
smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet

306
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:30,680
way, "ahhh, that's it. ahh ,of course, of 
course, what you say is true, no doubt." But,

307
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,839
by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, 
your communications will improve very much

308
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,839
with others.

309
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:46,650
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very 
common, very common, "Mother, they came and

310
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:54,609
told me, our leader told me, that you are 
bhootish. What is bhootish?" Another one says,

311
00:46:54,609 --> 00:47:00,960
"But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright. 
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that

312
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:09,060
you have got a bhoot in you. Now what are 
these three categories? Tell us." Why to tell

313
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:15,650
anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's 
no need. If you know how to correct it, just

314
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:22,130
say "left Swadisthana" and correct it. Take 
it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

315
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,760
Alright, if the person is good natured and 
a good person then it's even more important.

316
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,079
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's 
just a badha from outside. We'll have to take

317
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:41,220
it out." But a person who has got agnya and 
all these things, plus that he has got this

318
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,300
left Swadisthana, then, of course, you should 
say, "Baba, we cannot help you," because you

319
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,960
know he is cunning. What's the use of playing 
with that?

320
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:00,040
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget. Anybody who 
comes "Alright, come along, come along, come

321
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:12,040
along." Everybody is not capable of Sahaja 
Yoga, one has to know that. Not the whole

322
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:20,059
world. Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people 
who are deserving, who are seekers and who

323
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:27,559
are courageous - viras. It's not meant for 
ordinary people. So we open our door to everyone

324
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,400
and all such people walk in and then we work 
very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

325
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:43,450
and we find that they create problems for 
us. So first, only deal with people who are

326
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:50,579
simple, as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and 
Gopis; and then we can see, in a collective

327
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:59,369
way, if we can face somebody who's complicated. 
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh,

328
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,410
not possible.

329
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:07,920
So one should not try to do impossible tasks 
in Sahaja Yoga, which Shri Krishna has shown

330
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:18,180
in His own character by avoiding things which 
He didn't want to do - no. And He did it because

331
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:25,780
He was such a master. Of course, for Him, 
it was not necessary to face himself to master

332
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:33,619
himself, because He knew himself, He is the 
Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything. When

333
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:38,650
you know everything there is no need for you 
to master, what are you going to master? On

334
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:46,550
the contrary you sometimes get frightened 
of yourself, that you know so much.

335
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:56,190
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human 
beings in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know ourselves

336
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:02,250
very well - "Now oh that's my speciality." 
In that you have to see: "How I face myself

337
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:14,510
all the time? Why do I say such a thing? What 
is lurking in my mind?" Negativity is something

338
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,190
to be seen very clearly within yourself.

339
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:22,880
As I must have told you so many examples that 
the western negativity is like this that,

340
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:34,500
their minds are all the time labor saving 
devices. They don't like to work anyway. For

341
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:43,940
example, you tell them "You go and telephone 
to someone." Immediately they will tell you

342
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:51,720
ten explanations: he may not be there, his 
wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

343
00:50:51,720 --> 00:51:01,650
it's ten o'clock, this, that. But if you telephone 
he's there, but they won't telephone. Hundred

344
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:09,839
excuses. Now new excuses have started: "the 
computer was not working, fax was not working."

345
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:18,020
Except for your brain everything works. But 
the other way around it is: your brain is

346
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:24,680
not working and everything is not working. 
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever

347
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:35,829
it is. But you must learn, "Why can't I find 
the solution? I must do something."

348
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:43,520
Like I have told you, the tip of a root - how 
it manages to go round and round and seek

349
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,050
the source of water. In the same way, are 
we doing something about it? Alright, if this

350
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:54,930
is not available, do that, if that is not 
available do this. Out of nothing you can

351
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:01,079
do so many things. But if you want to find 
out all the time "That cannot be done, that

352
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:09,970
cannot be done". [That was] not [the case] 
with Shri Krishna! After all He was the incarnation

353
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:14,809
of Virata, the Master of Masters we should 
say.

354
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:21,970
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi 
was actually Vishnumaya His sister - She thought

355
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:31,349
of Shri Krishna. She was holding onto her 
sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

356
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:34,770
And She was holding it like this (with Her 
teeth). "Kri", She wanted to say "Krishna"

357
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:40,069
but She thought, "If I say 'shna' it will 
fall down." So She was holding on. As soon

358
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:52,290
as She dropped it, "shna", sari dropped out 
(of Her mouth), then it's described, about

359
00:52:52,290 --> 00:53:04,589
Shri Krishna, "Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor 
bhayo bhare. Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda

360
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:11,160
laysidhare." [Meaning:] that sound went into 
Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika and where is

361
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:21,000
Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands 
miles [apart]. But the sound went through

362
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:30,520
Chaitanya and made a big sound there; and 
"Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma". Shankha, Chakra

363
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:38,170
Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as 
you know. All of them He took and came on

364
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:48,530
His Garuda to save the chastity of His sister 
- immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

365
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:55,760
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let 
one sari come out then I'll go later."

366
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:03,660
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which 
you give for My Pujas, which are too many!

367
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:10,859
That's what I feel, that, from where did He 
get all these saris to give to Her? Must be

368
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:16,890
from My own storage I'm sure, and that's why 
you are giving Me so many saris, so that He

369
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:29,450
can save the chastity of many women. All this 
is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

370
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:36,410
There's such a big drama going on but you 
can't see it.

371
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:48,400
But if you believe in yourself and if you 
really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

372
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:59,960
that: what are your qualities, what you are, 
what's your value is, then I'm sure you can

373
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:08,530
become masters. But first of all we have no 
value of our realization. We do not know what

374
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,730
we are capable of, what we can do. You still 
think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

375
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,450
Mother has given me realization. I have never 
been to university." Nobody has been to university.

376
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:27,049
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any 
university, Krishna never went into university,

377
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:36,520
Christ never went to any university - an ordinary 
man, a son of a carpenter.

378
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:42,059
But you are realized souls but you don't realize 
your worth and value. Once you realize it,

379
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:47,040
you will just smile at everything. Because 
you don't know you are sitting on top of the

380
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,710
world. Once you know that - only then your 
mastery will work. Otherwise imagine a master

381
00:55:53,710 --> 00:56:02,819
sitting under the foot of a disciple, what 
will it look like? But it's not that you dominate

382
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:12,530
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge. 
You know everything, you know how to handle,

383
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:17,190
you know how to manage. This is the mastery 
you have to get. This is possible, absolutely

384
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:22,829
possible, for all of you to do it. But the 
first and foremost thing you have to know

385
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:26,390
is that we have to master ourselves.

386
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:39,030
But then immediately people say "Mother it's 
the most difficult to master yourself." I

387
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:45,490
can't understand this. Why not? You try to 
master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

388
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:54,380
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, 
it's your own, it's your own property. You

389
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:00,390
can correct the property of others, why can't 
you correct your own property? It should be

390
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:05,869
the easiest thing to do but you're not sure 
that this is your own, you do not know that

391
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:12,970
you are capable, but you are and now you have 
Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

392
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:20,099
Why should you not try to watch yourself and 
see for yourself? And then you will know that

393
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:30,670
you know all the tricks, the yukti. I don't 
have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

394
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,680
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

395
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,569
We know so many things, little little things, 
about ordinary material things: something's

396
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:49,079
falling? Alright - put some support to it. 
This is happening? Put it that way. But in

397
00:57:49,079 --> 00:58:00,130
spiritual life it's the easiest thing because 
you are in the ocean of knowledge. But if

398
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:04,000
you do not know that you are, in the ocean 
of knowledge, you will not know the tricks,

399
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:12,450
of dealing with others. Because the main purpose 
of our communication is to emancipate the

400
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,589
whole world, to emancipate them. To bring 
them out of their ignorance.

401
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:26,470
So for that we have to develop this mastery 
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

402
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:33,800
but this mastery has to be developed. For 
that, meditation early in the morning is required

403
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:43,369
- to begin with. And then facing yourself 
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

404
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:52,240
"Aahhhh must be this. This is the word I picked 
up from that person." So when you start facing

405
00:58:52,240 --> 00:59:00,250
yourself, you will be surprised that you are 
trying to avoid the reality and just using

406
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,089
your mind. See there, as I say, that this 
mind cheats you and tells you, "all right,

407
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:03,210
forget it".

408
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:24,849
And the last, but not the least, is that Shri 
Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

409
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:38,200
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and 
He's the spectator also. In these three forms

410
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:46,319
you should see yourself. You create the drama 
of yourself, "aha this one now, see now, how

411
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:55,380
I'm acting here!" Then you become the spectator 
also. Become the spectator of your own dramas,

412
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:04,470
then you will realize what you are doing, 
how you are working out everything. Then the

413
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:13,119
deception that we have, all the time, against 
ourselves, will just run away. Because if

414
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:20,339
an artist knows he's the spectator, if the 
one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

415
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:30,180
he can never deceive himself, because He knows 
this is acting. So this self-deception is

416
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,530
the one [that] one should try to avoid - "let 
me face it."

417
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:41,869
But also there is another way out, people 
find out. I mean, there are ways and ways.

418
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:51,839
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write 
a letter?" "I know!" 'I know' means what?

419
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:59,559
"But don't you think you should have written 
a letter to that person, who has done so much

420
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,349
for you?" "I know." "But don't you think it's 
very bad and cruel on your part not to have

421
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:07,079
written the letter?" "I know." 'I know' means 
what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been

422
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:15,160
stupid. I know I should not have done it. 
But I know also that." So what next? Because

423
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,640
they think that if they have confessed that 
"I know," [it's] finished!

424
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,579
So this is a new escape which was not [there] 
at the time of Shri Krishna, it's a new modern

425
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:32,200
one, where people say "I know, alright so 
what?" "Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?"

426
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:38,819
This is the second side of it. First of all 
"I know that I'm a sinner" and second is a

427
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:43,750
higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

428
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:51,680
So this is how the derailment starts and one 
goes from one to another. If I know something

429
01:01:51,680 --> 01:02:02,260
then why shouldn't I correct myself? That's 
what it should be. "I know I'm like that I

430
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:08,839
know it." If you know then you should also 
know the trick - how to get rid of it. Because

431
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:17,109
you are detached from that personality about 
which you know, you can correct yourself.

432
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:24,420
This is what yoga is, where all your attention 
is one with the Divine and you are so detached

433
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:37,130
that you can see it. The attachment to all 
the things are finished and now the force

434
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:44,839
that is coming to you is acting through you 
and acting on these attachments also.

435
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:53,859
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja 
Yoga in a very different way, and if there

436
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:59,650
is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in, either 
he's thrown out or he has to be alright. It's

437
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:05,329
the other way around. Anyone who is a bad 
Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga, then

438
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:08,579
he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

439
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:17,650
It is a I think a more evolved state now than 
it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because

440
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:26,299
He talked only to one - Arjuna. Now I'm talking 
to thousands - this knowledge. That time He

441
01:03:26,299 --> 01:03:32,650
just talked about it at the time of war. I'm 
talking at the time of peace. And it's much

442
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:39,180
more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give 
him realization. But you have got the realization,

443
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:44,940
you've got the knowledge, you know everything. 
You have all the subtle ideas.

444
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:51,329
So this is what it is today, as it is, the 
situation, that: you have become part and

445
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:56,569
parcel of Virata already. You have not seen 
the Virata (as Arjuna did), but you are part

446
01:03:56,569 --> 01:04:05,140
and parcel of it. You are not watching it, 
you are inside it. So that anymore of not

447
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:13,760
watching yourself, only thing will be that, 
you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Or else

448
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:24,270
you better watch yourself and correct yourself 
and be one with the body of the Virata.

449
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:31,750
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara, and that's 
how you have to be, in a mood which is very

450
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:39,980
smiling, knowing everything and not sarcastic, 
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving,

451
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:48,740
affectionate smile, that you should have for 
all the other people and immediately they'll

452
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,760
recognize. I have seen small children are 
like that. They are extremely patronising

453
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,750
sometimes, you know. They see their parents 
and this and that. So they come and tell you

454
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:08,220
that, "don't worry everything will be all 
right, after all God is there to look after

455
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:13,400
you." And they can be extremely, extremely 
loving and kind and the way they talk they

456
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,349
will neutralize the whole thing.

457
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:26,559
So we have to learn a lot from our children, 
from all the little babies that we have and

458
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,230
that we ourselves should have that Ganesha 
principal within us, with innocence we should

459
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:37,450
work it out. Innocence is the most intelligent 
thing and most effective thing. So I would

460
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:44,650
request you, all of you, to face yourself 
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

461
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,359
respect yourself and try to evolve your own 
glory.

462
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,779
May God bless you.
