Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Shrirampur Puja, India

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,800
December 12, 1990

3
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,620
Please be seated.

4
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,370
[Marathi]

5
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,370
We have come to this place with the idea that
we'll be comfortable in the other place as

6
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,469
we were before, but you must have known that
there's a man who is quite devilish, and he

7
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:10,469
has tried to make this funny arrangement just
to extract some money from us for doing nothing.

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,840
What I have to tell you, that we should remember
that when we are doing right in this Kruta

9
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:28,210
Yuga, this is the time when the Paramachaitanya
has become active. That's why it is called

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,760
as Kruta Yuga. At this time this power is
extremely active. They used to torture the

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,500
saints in this country and every country,
who were real people. And they used to also

12
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:05,490
make their lives impossible, because they
were lonely people - one saint here, one saint

13
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,480
there. But in these modern times we are so
many - we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over

14
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:26,090
the world. So first of all we are collectively
very strong, and secondly the Brahmachaitanya

15
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:33,849
Itself has become active. It's a very great
thing, we must realize it within ourselves,

16
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:41,409
that no amount of cruelty, planning against
us, any kind of violence of other people cannot

17
00:02:53,469 --> 00:03:00,469
harm us. If they ever try to harm us, they'll
be harmed themselves; apart from that, all

18
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:10,849
our work will go all smoothly. But we should
not lose even for a minute our self-confidence

19
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:24,739
and our determination. Above all we must have
faith in the Paramachaitanya, which is now

20
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,560
acting.

21
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,560
All our complaints, all our problems are because
of ourselves. Because we lose faith in ourselves,

22
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,400
then all these horrible things happen. And
whatever may happen, even when people stoned

23
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:12,230
us it has helped us a lot. Of course some
people were hurt a little bit, doesn’t matter.

24
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:19,230
But the case has been filed, and this horrible
organization is under trouble. Nobody could

25
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,660
do anything to them. Only when we started
our own court case they have become quieter.

26
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,860
How things work out for our help, one can
see it so clearly, and one should have full

27
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:51,699
faith in oneself to understand that God is
with us and He is all-powerful.

28
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,520
So many examples you can give and so many
examples I can give, and I can tell you that

29
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,830
it is only our diffidence which makes problems
for us. Now supposing there was a snake. (Laughter)

30
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,199
There's nothing to be afraid of. No snake
can bite any Sahaja Yogi. They are more sensible

31
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:48,669
than these devilish people. When I was in
Gandhi Ashram we were supposed to get up at

32
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:57,139
four o'clock. Gandhiji was a great disciplinarian.
He was not like Me. So everybody had to take

33
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:04,159
bath, and by five o'clock we had to go to
the Pratna. And in the Pratna place, even

34
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,110
reaching there we could see so many snakes
crawling around, and we were supposed to just

35
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,629
go to the Pratna place without complaining.
And sometimes you would find a snake just

36
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,610
sitting before you like this, and you were
supposed to keep quiet and do the Pratna.

37
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,939
But nobody was beaten up. All these years
I was there, used to visit that place, I must

38
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,270
have seen so many snakes; otherwise I have
never seen otherwise snakes much in life.

39
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,520
But that's the only time I have seen snakes
sitting just like this before some of the

40
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,520
meditators, and trying to enjoy their meditation.
(Laughter)

41
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Snakes understand vibrations - they love coolness.
Once I had gone to a village and My husband

42
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:06,560
had gone a little ahead; was sitting on a
bridge - there were some steps there - sitting

43
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,560
like this; and a big python like that started
moving under My foot, under My legs. I saw

44
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,030
it moving, such a thick one like this. It
moved. It didn't do anything to Me, I know

45
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,879
it cannot, because it likes the coolness and
it was enjoying very nicely moving. (Laughter)

46
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,150
It took about one-and-a-half minutes.

47
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,370
So first of all we have to realize that we
are Sahaja Yogis, specially blessed people,

48
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,199
that we have got Realization, which very few
people have got in this world. And secondly

49
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:49,199
that all the animals understand us. They understand
us better than human beings, because they

50
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,590
are under the control of God Almighty. I'm
never afraid of a tiger, never afraid of any

51
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:11,699
lions, nothing. I'm never afraid. But if I
see a madman or a drunkard - specially a drunkard,

52
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,080
I'm not afraid but I get repulsed, because
I think this man has such bad vibrations.

53
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Because animals never drink. Even a mad dog
is better than a madman. So we have to understand

54
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,570
that we are not under the control of God that
much, because God has given us freedom. But

55
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,570
now we are not only under the control of this
Paramachaitanya, but the Paramachaitanya looks

56
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,370
after us every minute. And that's how things
work out. There’re so many instances of

57
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:03,350
this kind of thing. But if your faith is wavering,
if you are frightened, then you have to little

58
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,740
bit understand that you are not to be frightened.
Things have worked out - so many people can

59
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,000
tell you so many things. Swiss people were
to come for a Puja in Poona. I knew they were

60
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to come. They never informed us, but I knew.
And I was postponing the Puja as much as I

61
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:31,190
could. These people took a taxi from Bombay
and they came up to Poona, and they wanted

62
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,190
to go to Pratishthana. This they knew, the
taxi fellow knew. Instead of going to Pratishthan

63
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:48,190
he took them to another place, Bhugaon, where
we all were camping. And these people saw,

64
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,670
so they just got down. He said, "No, no, this
is not Pratishthan." He said, "This is the

65
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,200
place we had to come." And they were just
right in time there.

66
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I mean, you can all write so many things,
how God has helped you in every way possible:

67
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,279
monetarily, as protection, as blessings from
all sides. So to solve the problem, we don't

68
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,329
have to worry. Actually we should have no
problems at all. Some people start thinking

69
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:39,019
that by logical deductions they can find out
things. They cannot, because you are at a

70
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:46,310
level that logic doesn't work. You are at
a level where Brahmachaitanya works, and It

71
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:54,070
has Its own logic. So do not try to resolve
anything by logic. First thing your connection

72
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:01,180
with the Spirit will be lost, your connection
with the joy will be lost, your connection

73
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:08,180
with the vibrations will be lost. So there
is no logical conclusion, but the Divine logic

74
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,190
takes over. That doesn't mean that you are
a slave, but on the contrary you are the great

75
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:29,260
guest in the Kingdom of God. There's a difference
between the two attitudes. Supposing I come

76
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,540
here, so they want that they should garland
Me. I can say, "I'm not your slave, why should

77
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,730
you garland Me?" They may say, "We'd like
You to come for a procession." I may say,

78
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,839
"I cannot come, I'm sorry. I'm free. I will
do what I like. How can you decide for Me?"

79
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,839
But I am their guest and they are inviting
Me to honor, to look after Me, for protection.

80
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,230
If something you people try to do for My protection,
should I say that it is slavery? Of course

81
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:18,759
you know that I don't need any protection,
but still you try to protect Me. It's all

82
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:25,759
right, I don't mind, because if that gives
you pleasure I don't mind, and I don't feel

83
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,730
that way about it, as if I have become now
a slave of all the Sahaja Yogis. You fix Me

84
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:40,889
up and I am moving like a shuttlecock all
the time. I never grudge, never grumble. All

85
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,880
right, I accept it, whatever you say. You
are not doing to harm Me in any way, or to

86
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,880
be disrespectful, but you are trying to help
Me out in a way that I should be able to achieve

87
00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:01,029
greater capacity to work, and a greater facility.
How can I not understand that?

88
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:11,209
So you have to have that kind of an intelligence
to feel the existence of that All-pervading

89
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Power all round us. You have seen so many
photographs. You have seen on top of your

90
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,990
heads there is Light. Though mentally you
accept, but in the heart you do not. Those

91
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,240
people accept in the heart, I know them, and
those who do not accept, I know them. Those

92
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,860
who accept Me never allow Me to say, "Why
didn't you do this?" Whatever I say they will

93
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,750
do, because now they have accepted Me from
their heart.

94
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,750
Like yesterday it was a simple thing: I bought
these caps for you. So many didn't buy, I

95
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,880
was surprised. I went all the way to buy,
to protect your heads. Why didn't you buy

96
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,190
them? They're worth nothing: three, four rupees
is what? - nothing. Or the dhotis I bought

97
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,410
for you. All the way - I don't mind if you
don't want to buy, but it's surprising they

98
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:24,410
didn't buy. You could have worn them today
and you would have looked very nice. Of course

99
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,500
you have freedom. It's worth nothing - but
it shows how far you are there. Mother has

100
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,120
bought it, with such love She has selected
for us, it's worth nothing. I could have given

101
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,120
you them as presents also, but I just wanted
to test. And this is how the testing comes.

102
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,050
After all there's no harm in wearing a cap
in this heat; it's better to wear the cap.

103
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,490
And also to have a dhoti is better because
that's the dress of this country, and whatever

104
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,829
is the dress of the country, that is more
suitable for this country. It's very hot here

105
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:10,699
and the dhoti, which is a cotton dhoti or
a, even a silk dhoti, is a beautiful thing

106
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:17,699
to wear. I don't want to force anything on
you, but it is you who are judged also, that

107
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,040
such a small thing like a cap... Now how many
of you did not buy the cap? Raise your hands.

108
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,600
All right. So give them presents! (Laughter)
And how many of you didn't buy the dhotis?

109
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,899
Should I give you presents? Please buy.

110
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:57,670
Yogi: [ ? ]

111
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:04,670
Shri Mataji: It’s finished - all right,
so I'll get you more. But they are very comfortable

112
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:14,259
and beautiful, very nice, so beautiful. You'll
enjoy them.

113
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:23,540
All right. So small, small things can express
our attention - very small things. Like such

114
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:40,610
a great sky is there, and when you look at
it every leaf, supposing there is a tree,

115
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,750
every leaf can be seen against that sky. In
the same way Sahaja Yoga is such a great thing.

116
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:01,879
But it shows every small curves, and every
delicate behavior. Of course there's no challenge,

117
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:15,620
no personality insult or in any way. But the
more you understand Sahaja Yoga, the deeper

118
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,230
you go into it, you will know that everything,
whatever is done in Sahaja Yoga is for your

119
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,339
benevolence. Nothing else, it's for your benevolence.
And that this power is so well-equipped with

120
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,890
everything. And you must have full faith in
yourself and in this power, that whatever

121
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,520
you do and whatever you want, or whatever
is your forward movement - everything is looked

122
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:15,309
after, guided, organized, arranged for you
beforehand. Thus you'll be surprised how you

123
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,539
are looked after.

124
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:33,860
Now specially for ladies, their one of the
assets of ladies is to be frightened and another

125
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,860
is to cry. So, of course I too cry sometimes,
but never at My own discomfiture. Never at

126
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,380
My own pain, only when others are pained then
My eyes, being collective, start just pouring

127
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,980
uncontrolled tears. But for Myself I never
cry. For My pain, even if I want to I cannot.

128
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,650
I cannot. Just My body cannot.

129
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:31,650
The second thing you must know: I am also
a woman; I am never afraid of anything whatsoever.

130
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:43,539
Of course animals I have already told you.
Except for the drunkard - (Shri Mataji laughing)

131
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:49,190
you don't know how he'll behave, because not
easy, not senses. I'm not afraid of anything

132
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:56,190
whatsoever. In the same way you have to know
that your Mother is with you and you should

133
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,520
have no fear at all, and then to boast of
your fear is nonsensical. Once you realize

134
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,039
how powerful you are, and how much you are
connected to that power which is so powerful

135
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:28,110
and all-pervading, which does all the living
work, you will never get anyone of these funny

136
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:37,020
ideas which are to be left behind. You have
to cross the threshold of these conditionings

137
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,240
that you have had. Just open your heart and
see for yourself - where are you sitting,

138
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:42,580
where have 
you reached, under what blessings you are
here.

139
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:38,150
May God 

140
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,100
bless you!

141
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,040
[Marathi]
