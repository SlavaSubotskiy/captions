1997-1004 EP Navaratri Puja P2,
Cabella

2
01:28:55,112 --> 01:29:00,333
“Litany for the doom of Materasura”

3
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:07,745
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

4
01:29:07,996 --> 01:29:14,269
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

5
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:19,466
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

6
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:27,390
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

7
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:48,411
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

8
01:29:48,612 --> 01:29:52,630
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

9
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:57,676
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

10
01:29:57,877 --> 01:30:02,669
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

11
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:06,606
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

12
01:30:06,807 --> 01:30:08,620
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

13
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:13,445
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

14
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:18,279
Om Twameva Sakshat

15
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:26,028
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

16
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:29,748
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

17
01:30:29,949 --> 01:30:35,130
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

18
01:30:35,331 --> 01:30:39,287
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

19
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,451
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

20
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:45,083
has become a most prosperous
activity,

21
01:30:45,284 --> 01:30:48,911
reaching all levels of society.

22
01:30:49,112 --> 01:30:52,271
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

23
01:30:52,472 --> 01:30:56,656
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

24
01:30:56,857 --> 01:31:01,776
Om Twameva Sakshat

25
01:31:01,977 --> 01:31:11,568
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

26
01:31:11,769 --> 01:31:15,636
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

27
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:19,253
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

28
01:31:19,454 --> 01:31:23,691
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

29
01:31:23,892 --> 01:31:26,472
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

30
01:31:26,673 --> 01:31:30,860
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

31
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:35,798
Om Twameva Sakshat

32
01:31:35,999 --> 01:31:45,587
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

33
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:51,525
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

34
01:31:51,726 --> 01:31:57,177
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

35
01:31:57,378 --> 01:32:02,092
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

36
01:32:02,293 --> 01:32:07,865
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

37
01:32:08,066 --> 01:32:10,895
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

38
01:32:11,096 --> 01:32:15,208
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

39
01:32:15,409 --> 01:32:19,864
Om Twameva Sakshat

40
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:27,694
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

41
01:32:27,895 --> 01:32:32,104
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

42
01:32:32,305 --> 01:32:37,153
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

43
01:32:37,354 --> 01:32:40,591
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

44
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:45,145
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

45
01:32:45,346 --> 01:32:47,473
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

46
01:32:47,674 --> 01:32:51,731
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

47
01:32:51,932 --> 01:32:56,286
Om Twameva Sakshat

48
01:32:56,487 --> 01:33:04,341
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

49
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:09,708
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

50
01:33:09,939 --> 01:33:13,762
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

51
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:17,200
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

52
01:33:17,401 --> 01:33:19,364
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

53
01:33:19,565 --> 01:33:23,450
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

54
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:27,959
Om Twameva Sakshat

55
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:37,475
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

56
01:33:37,676 --> 01:33:42,131
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

57
01:33:42,332 --> 01:33:46,485
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

58
01:33:46,686 --> 01:33:53,095
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

59
01:33:53,296 --> 01:33:54,859
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

60
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:59,862
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

61
01:34:00,063 --> 01:34:04,749
Om Twameva Sakshat

62
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:12,904
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

63
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:18,345
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

64
01:34:18,546 --> 01:34:23,288
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

65
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:28,134
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

66
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:30,122
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

67
01:34:30,323 --> 01:34:33,947
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

68
01:34:34,148 --> 01:34:39,041
Om Twameva Sakshat

69
01:34:39,242 --> 01:34:47,399
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

70
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,759
9. Greed raised to the power 108

71
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,374
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

72
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:58,612
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

73
01:34:58,813 --> 01:35:01,450
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

74
01:35:01,651 --> 01:35:06,040
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

75
01:35:06,241 --> 01:35:10,664
Om Twameva Sakshat

76
01:35:10,865 --> 01:35:21,794
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

77
01:35:21,995 --> 01:35:26,864
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

78
01:35:27,072 --> 01:35:33,025
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

79
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:37,614
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

80
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,601
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

81
01:35:39,802 --> 01:35:43,091
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

82
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:48,324
Om Twameva Sakshat

83
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:55,633
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

84
01:35:55,834 --> 01:36:00,359
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

85
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:06,020
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

86
01:36:06,221 --> 01:36:11,221
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

87
01:36:11,422 --> 01:36:14,776
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

88
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:17,271
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

89
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:21,966
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

90
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:26,376
Om Twameva Sakshat

91
01:36:26,577 --> 01:36:35,901
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

92
01:36:36,102 --> 01:36:40,859
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

93
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,919
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

94
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:49,145
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

95
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:55,770
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

96
01:36:55,971 --> 01:36:58,353
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

97
01:36:58,554 --> 01:37:02,595
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

98
01:37:02,796 --> 01:37:07,361
Om Twameva Sakshat

99
01:37:07,562 --> 01:37:16,807
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

100
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:22,027
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

101
01:37:22,228 --> 01:37:26,731
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

102
01:37:26,932 --> 01:37:31,323
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

103
01:37:31,524 --> 01:37:36,742
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

104
01:37:36,943 --> 01:37:38,769
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

105
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:43,655
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

106
01:37:43,856 --> 01:37:48,701
Om Twameva Sakshat

107
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:58,030
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

108
01:37:58,231 --> 01:38:01,900
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

109
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:06,603
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

110
01:38:06,804 --> 01:38:10,640
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

111
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:13,913
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

112
01:38:14,114 --> 01:38:15,859
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

113
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:20,356
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

114
01:38:20,557 --> 01:38:25,298
Om Twameva Sakshat

115
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:33,990
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

116
01:38:34,191 --> 01:38:38,699
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

117
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:44,070
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

118
01:38:44,271 --> 01:38:50,686
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

119
01:38:50,887 --> 01:38:52,953
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

120
01:38:53,154 --> 01:38:57,871
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

121
01:38:58,072 --> 01:39:02,544
Om Twameva Sakshat

122
01:39:02,745 --> 01:39:12,657
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

123
01:39:12,858 --> 01:39:18,191
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

124
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:23,149
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

125
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:26,547
building up a planetary gambling
casino

126
01:39:26,748 --> 01:39:30,846
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

127
01:39:31,047 --> 01:39:38,220
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

128
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:40,929
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

129
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:45,380
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

130
01:39:45,581 --> 01:39:49,802
Om Twameva Sakshat

131
01:39:50,003 --> 01:39:58,150
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

132
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:04,223
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

133
01:40:04,424 --> 01:40:10,658
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

134
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:12,466
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

135
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:17,233
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

136
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:21,674
Om Twameva Sakshat

137
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:30,070
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

138
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:33,254
18. The progressive domination
of technology

139
01:40:33,455 --> 01:40:37,276
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

140
01:40:37,484 --> 01:40:43,215
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

141
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:46,243
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

142
01:40:46,444 --> 01:40:50,580
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

143
01:40:50,781 --> 01:40:55,220
Om Twameva Sakshat

144
01:40:55,421 --> 01:41:05,230
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

145
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:10,528
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

146
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:15,469
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

147
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:21,141
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

148
01:41:21,342 --> 01:41:23,088
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

149
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:27,855
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

150
01:41:28,056 --> 01:41:32,291
Om Twameva Sakshat

151
01:41:32,492 --> 01:41:40,412
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

152
01:41:40,613 --> 01:41:44,392
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

153
01:41:44,593 --> 01:41:49,111
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

154
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:56,435
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

155
01:41:56,636 --> 01:41:58,756
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

156
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:03,410
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

157
01:42:03,611 --> 01:42:08,050
Om Twameva Sakshat

158
01:42:08,251 --> 01:42:16,306
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

159
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:21,381
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

160
01:42:21,582 --> 01:42:25,351
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

161
01:42:25,552 --> 01:42:31,354
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

162
01:42:31,555 --> 01:42:33,585
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

163
01:42:33,786 --> 01:42:38,201
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

164
01:42:38,409 --> 01:42:43,342
Om Twameva Sakshat

165
01:42:43,543 --> 01:42:54,029
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

166
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:59,242
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

167
01:42:59,443 --> 01:43:03,494
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

168
01:43:03,695 --> 01:43:06,735
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

169
01:43:06,936 --> 01:43:10,749
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

170
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:16,126
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

171
01:43:16,327 --> 01:43:20,043
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

172
01:43:20,244 --> 01:43:24,067
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

173
01:43:24,268 --> 01:43:28,666
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

174
01:43:28,867 --> 01:43:34,824
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

175
01:43:35,025 --> 01:43:38,204
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

176
01:43:38,405 --> 01:43:41,890
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

177
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:44,474
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

178
01:43:44,675 --> 01:43:52,540
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

179
01:43:52,741 --> 01:43:55,023
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

180
01:43:55,224 --> 01:44:01,663
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

181
01:44:01,864 --> 01:44:09,751
Om Twameva Sakshat

182
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:16,608
Shri Kalki Sakshat

183
01:44:16,809 --> 01:44:24,808
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

184
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:37,650
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

185
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:52,150
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.

186
01:44:59,844 --> 01:45:10,229
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

187
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:20,478
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

188
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:29,760
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

189
01:45:29,961 --> 01:45:36,495
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

190
01:45:37,116 --> 01:45:43,456
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

191
01:45:46,192 --> 01:45:53,243
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

192
01:45:53,444 --> 01:45:56,874
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

193
01:45:57,075 --> 01:46:06,462
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

194
01:46:07,442 --> 01:46:11,782
And for that I have a plan.

195
01:46:11,983 --> 01:46:18,785
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

196
01:46:18,986 --> 01:46:24,935
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

197
01:46:25,136 --> 01:46:31,942
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

198
01:46:32,143 --> 01:46:36,899
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

199
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:40,899
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

200
01:46:41,122 --> 01:46:49,288
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

201
01:46:49,575 --> 01:46:57,385
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

202
01:46:58,027 --> 01:47:06,924
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

203
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:12,516
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

204
01:47:12,717 --> 01:47:16,660
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

205
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:24,815
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

206
01:47:25,016 --> 01:47:28,630
But not only in England, same in Paris:

207
01:47:28,831 --> 01:47:33,842
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

208
01:47:34,043 --> 01:47:38,419
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

209
01:47:39,102 --> 01:47:43,248
This madness is on and on and on.

210
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:49,929
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

211
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:54,785
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

212
01:47:55,648 --> 01:48:00,323
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

213
01:48:00,524 --> 01:48:08,346
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

214
01:48:08,547 --> 01:48:14,919
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

215
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,620
of these useless things?

216
01:48:17,796 --> 01:48:21,222
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

217
01:48:21,423 --> 01:48:28,487
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

218
01:48:28,688 --> 01:48:32,897
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

219
01:48:33,097 --> 01:48:38,038
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

220
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:45,706
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

221
01:48:45,907 --> 01:48:48,515
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

222
01:48:48,716 --> 01:48:52,432
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

223
01:48:52,633 --> 01:49:00,606
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

224
01:49:00,807 --> 01:49:07,194
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

225
01:49:07,395 --> 01:49:13,607
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

226
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:24,173
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

227
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:32,315
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

228
01:49:32,516 --> 01:49:35,756
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

229
01:49:35,957 --> 01:49:40,077
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

230
01:49:40,278 --> 01:49:45,591
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

231
01:49:45,792 --> 01:49:48,528
So, it is against you.

232
01:49:48,729 --> 01:49:57,903
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

233
01:49:58,104 --> 01:50:03,697
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

234
01:50:03,898 --> 01:50:07,558
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

235
01:50:07,759 --> 01:50:18,295
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

236
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:22,590
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

237
01:50:22,791 --> 01:50:27,531
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

238
01:50:27,732 --> 01:50:31,882
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

239
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:39,935
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

240
01:50:41,129 --> 01:50:46,766
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

241
01:50:46,967 --> 01:50:51,677
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

242
01:50:51,955 --> 01:51:01,423
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

243
01:51:01,624 --> 01:51:05,095
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

244
01:51:05,296 --> 01:51:10,458
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

245
01:51:10,637 --> 01:51:16,461
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

246
01:51:16,661 --> 01:51:22,257
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

247
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:27,590
Because wisdom itself shows

248
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:33,855
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

249
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:39,389
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

250
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:43,566
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

251
01:51:43,767 --> 01:51:49,680
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

252
01:51:49,881 --> 01:51:58,914
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

253
01:51:59,115 --> 01:52:02,965
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

254
01:52:03,166 --> 01:52:07,730
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

255
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:11,871
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

256
01:52:12,072 --> 01:52:17,660
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

257
01:52:17,861 --> 01:52:21,884
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

258
01:52:22,085 --> 01:52:27,835
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

259
01:52:28,036 --> 01:52:31,665
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

260
01:52:31,866 --> 01:52:37,253
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

261
01:52:37,454 --> 01:52:42,151
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

262
01:52:42,352 --> 01:52:48,452
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

263
01:52:48,653 --> 01:52:54,740
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

264
01:52:54,941 --> 01:53:00,477
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

265
01:53:00,678 --> 01:53:06,436
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

266
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:14,181
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

267
01:53:14,382 --> 01:53:19,615
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

268
01:53:19,816 --> 01:53:22,401
Evening time the car used to come,

269
01:53:22,602 --> 01:53:28,986
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

270
01:53:29,187 --> 01:53:35,044
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

271
01:53:35,245 --> 01:53:42,337
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

272
01:53:42,538 --> 01:53:46,568
At the most you can see some lamppost.

273
01:53:46,769 --> 01:53:52,550
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

274
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:59,614
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

275
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:07,434
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

276
01:54:07,617 --> 01:54:12,696
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

277
01:54:12,897 --> 01:54:16,966
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

278
01:54:17,167 --> 01:54:23,479
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

279
01:54:24,373 --> 01:54:30,017
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

280
01:54:30,218 --> 01:54:34,684
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

281
01:54:34,885 --> 01:54:39,686
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

282
01:54:40,531 --> 01:54:45,164
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

283
01:54:45,365 --> 01:54:51,811
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

284
01:54:52,552 --> 01:55:01,112
Now see what has happened in, say,

285
01:55:01,313 --> 01:55:07,609
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

286
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:12,601
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

287
01:55:12,802 --> 01:55:15,855
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

288
01:55:16,056 --> 01:55:20,913
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

289
01:55:21,635 --> 01:55:26,396
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

290
01:55:26,597 --> 01:55:34,871
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

291
01:55:35,072 --> 01:55:40,876
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

292
01:55:41,077 --> 01:55:45,282
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

293
01:55:45,483 --> 01:55:51,153
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

294
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:56,922
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

295
01:55:57,099 --> 01:55:59,834
And it’s all working out everywhere.

296
01:56:00,035 --> 01:56:05,343
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

297
01:56:05,544 --> 01:56:12,611
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

298
01:56:14,044 --> 01:56:17,353
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

299
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:23,242
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

300
01:56:23,403 --> 01:56:25,994
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

301
01:56:26,171 --> 01:56:29,949
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

302
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:34,676
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

303
01:56:34,877 --> 01:56:39,577
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

304
01:56:42,925 --> 01:56:47,790
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

305
01:56:47,991 --> 01:56:50,841
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

306
01:56:51,042 --> 01:56:56,856
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

307
01:56:57,057 --> 01:57:03,465
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

308
01:57:03,666 --> 01:57:08,185
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

309
01:57:08,386 --> 01:57:15,245
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

310
01:57:15,446 --> 01:57:25,568
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

311
01:57:25,769 --> 01:57:31,280
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

312
01:57:31,481 --> 01:57:33,827
So many have lost their money there,

313
01:57:34,004 --> 01:57:36,559
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

314
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:40,980
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

315
01:57:41,181 --> 01:57:50,025
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

316
01:57:50,922 --> 01:58:01,934
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

317
01:58:03,694 --> 01:58:09,362
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

318
01:58:09,703 --> 01:58:14,985
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

319
01:58:15,186 --> 01:58:22,248
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

320
01:58:22,454 --> 01:58:28,468
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

321
01:58:28,669 --> 01:58:33,754
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

322
01:58:33,955 --> 01:58:43,340
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

323
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:46,491
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

324
01:58:46,692 --> 01:58:51,085
because I spent money on My family things
also.

325
01:58:51,286 --> 01:58:58,297
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

326
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:02,382
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

327
01:59:02,583 --> 01:59:09,216
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

328
01:59:09,417 --> 01:59:16,535
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

329
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:20,363
Joy is much more in giving to others.

330
01:59:20,564 --> 01:59:28,852
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

331
01:59:29,053 --> 01:59:34,768
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

332
01:59:34,969 --> 01:59:42,736
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

333
01:59:42,937 --> 01:59:55,384
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

334
01:59:55,585 --> 02:00:00,407
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

335
02:00:00,608 --> 02:00:04,816
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

336
02:00:05,017 --> 02:00:09,600
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

337
02:00:09,801 --> 02:00:13,706
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

338
02:00:13,907 --> 02:00:19,262
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

339
02:00:19,463 --> 02:00:21,863
At least, there should be some embroidery,

340
02:00:22,064 --> 02:00:26,468
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

341
02:00:26,674 --> 02:00:31,066
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

342
02:00:31,267 --> 02:00:34,027
they are injurious to our health.

343
02:00:34,228 --> 02:00:39,367
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

344
02:00:39,568 --> 02:00:44,375
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

345
02:00:44,576 --> 02:00:50,121
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

346
02:00:50,322 --> 02:00:53,505
how many of you know?

347
02:00:58,093 --> 02:01:06,408
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

348
02:01:06,609 --> 02:01:10,698
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

349
02:01:10,899 --> 02:01:17,778
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

350
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:21,062
From where does this sari comes?

351
02:01:21,263 --> 02:01:27,044
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

352
02:01:27,245 --> 02:01:31,311
But even western men also have the same
problem.

353
02:01:31,512 --> 02:01:35,570
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

354
02:01:35,766 --> 02:01:40,047
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

355
02:01:40,248 --> 02:01:43,494
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

356
02:01:43,695 --> 02:01:47,869
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

357
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:54,265
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

358
02:01:55,929 --> 02:02:02,014
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

359
02:02:03,907 --> 02:02:11,201
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

360
02:02:11,402 --> 02:02:17,324
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

361
02:02:17,525 --> 02:02:21,250
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

362
02:02:21,451 --> 02:02:25,181
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

363
02:02:25,382 --> 02:02:30,637
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

364
02:02:30,838 --> 02:02:38,105
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

365
02:02:38,306 --> 02:02:45,016
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

366
02:02:45,217 --> 02:02:52,084
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

367
02:02:52,285 --> 02:02:55,356
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

368
02:02:55,517 --> 02:02:59,368
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

369
02:02:59,569 --> 02:03:06,086
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

370
02:03:06,287 --> 02:03:11,314
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

371
02:03:11,515 --> 02:03:16,658
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

372
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:23,692
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

373
02:03:23,893 --> 02:03:30,174
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

374
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:35,682
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

375
02:03:35,883 --> 02:03:38,561
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

376
02:03:38,762 --> 02:03:42,824
this is red but it has green to match it.

377
02:03:43,025 --> 02:03:46,523
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

378
02:03:46,724 --> 02:03:51,754
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

379
02:03:51,955 --> 02:03:56,342
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

380
02:03:56,543 --> 02:04:00,329
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

381
02:04:01,773 --> 02:04:04,040
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

382
02:04:04,241 --> 02:04:07,254
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

383
02:04:07,455 --> 02:04:11,373
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

384
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:15,684
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

385
02:04:15,885 --> 02:04:21,045
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

386
02:04:21,246 --> 02:04:24,864
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

387
02:04:25,065 --> 02:04:28,341
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

388
02:04:28,555 --> 02:04:33,905
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

389
02:04:34,106 --> 02:04:40,768
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

390
02:04:40,969 --> 02:04:47,902
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

391
02:04:48,103 --> 02:04:51,506
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

392
02:04:51,707 --> 02:04:55,123
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

393
02:04:55,324 --> 02:04:59,392
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

394
02:04:59,593 --> 02:05:03,774
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

395
02:05:03,975 --> 02:05:09,093
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

396
02:05:09,294 --> 02:05:14,517
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

397
02:05:14,718 --> 02:05:18,763
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

398
02:05:18,964 --> 02:05:22,722
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

399
02:05:22,923 --> 02:05:26,736
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

400
02:05:26,937 --> 02:05:29,715
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

401
02:05:29,916 --> 02:05:32,791
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

402
02:05:32,992 --> 02:05:39,136
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

403
02:05:39,337 --> 02:05:43,817
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

404
02:05:44,018 --> 02:05:49,935
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

405
02:05:50,136 --> 02:05:52,953
I sold one of My ornaments

406
02:05:53,154 --> 02:05:57,849
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

407
02:05:58,049 --> 02:06:02,358
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

408
02:06:02,559 --> 02:06:13,303
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

409
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:19,413
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

410
02:06:19,627 --> 02:06:25,069
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

411
02:06:26,357 --> 02:06:34,492
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

412
02:06:36,799 --> 02:06:40,013
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
 but I am missing him

413
02:06:40,214 --> 02:06:45,518
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

414
02:06:45,719 --> 02:06:48,198
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

415
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:54,022
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

416
02:06:54,223 --> 02:07:00,200
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

417
02:07:00,401 --> 02:07:04,912
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

418
02:07:05,113 --> 02:07:11,364
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

419
02:07:13,765 --> 02:07:17,437
These small, small things can give you
great joy

420
02:07:17,638 --> 02:07:23,518
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

421
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:28,301
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

422
02:07:28,502 --> 02:07:30,783
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

423
02:07:30,984 --> 02:07:35,101
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

424
02:07:35,302 --> 02:07:39,444
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

425
02:07:39,645 --> 02:07:42,919
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

426
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:50,303
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

427
02:07:50,504 --> 02:07:54,233
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

428
02:07:54,434 --> 02:07:57,137
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

429
02:07:57,338 --> 02:08:02,009
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

430
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:06,939
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

431
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:12,492
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

432
02:08:12,693 --> 02:08:16,854
I don’t even have time to see them.

433
02:08:17,761 --> 02:08:24,410
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

434
02:08:24,632 --> 02:08:28,337
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

435
02:08:28,538 --> 02:08:32,519
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

436
02:08:32,728 --> 02:08:37,105
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

437
02:08:37,306 --> 02:08:43,407
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

438
02:08:43,608 --> 02:08:48,281
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

439
02:08:48,482 --> 02:08:55,680
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

440
02:08:56,571 --> 02:09:00,328
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

441
02:09:00,529 --> 02:09:08,472
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

442
02:09:08,862 --> 02:09:14,375
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

443
02:09:14,576 --> 02:09:22,240
being absolutely beyond any problem.

444
02:09:22,543 --> 02:09:28,126
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

445
02:09:28,327 --> 02:09:34,133
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

446
02:09:34,334 --> 02:09:38,041
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

447
02:09:38,242 --> 02:09:42,963
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

448
02:09:43,164 --> 02:09:49,419
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

449
02:09:50,537 --> 02:09:55,364
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

450
02:09:55,565 --> 02:09:59,767
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

451
02:09:59,968 --> 02:10:03,106
Only the designers they make the money.

452
02:10:03,306 --> 02:10:08,170
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

453
02:10:09,721 --> 02:10:17,593
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

454
02:10:18,841 --> 02:10:21,447
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

455
02:10:21,648 --> 02:10:26,741
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

456
02:10:26,942 --> 02:10:32,172
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

457
02:10:33,252 --> 02:10:40,268
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

458
02:10:41,715 --> 02:10:45,726
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

459
02:10:45,927 --> 02:10:49,918
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

460
02:10:50,119 --> 02:10:55,109
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

461
02:10:55,317 --> 02:10:59,079
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

462
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:05,504
So, I went to one shop in America

463
02:11:05,705 --> 02:11:08,689
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

464
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:13,467
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

465
02:11:13,668 --> 02:11:20,204
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

466
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:24,918
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

467
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:35,075
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

468
02:11:35,276 --> 02:11:43,784
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

469
02:11:43,985 --> 02:11:48,642
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

470
02:11:48,843 --> 02:11:53,472
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

471
02:11:54,107 --> 02:11:58,527
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

472
02:11:59,113 --> 02:12:02,259
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

473
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:06,225
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

474
02:12:06,511 --> 02:12:10,506
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

475
02:12:10,707 --> 02:12:14,652
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

476
02:12:15,319 --> 02:12:19,481
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

477
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:23,202
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

478
02:12:23,403 --> 02:12:27,768
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

479
02:12:27,969 --> 02:12:34,132
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

480
02:12:34,333 --> 02:12:39,003
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

481
02:12:39,204 --> 02:12:44,276
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

482
02:12:44,477 --> 02:12:48,964
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

483
02:12:49,165 --> 02:12:51,885
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

484
02:12:52,094 --> 02:13:00,748
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

485
02:13:03,181 --> 02:13:08,979
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

486
02:13:09,203 --> 02:13:12,437
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

487
02:13:12,638 --> 02:13:16,583
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

488
02:13:16,784 --> 02:13:21,197
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

489
02:13:21,398 --> 02:13:28,236
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

490
02:13:28,437 --> 02:13:34,666
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

491
02:13:35,432 --> 02:13:40,837
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

492
02:13:41,038 --> 02:13:50,592
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

493
02:13:50,793 --> 02:13:55,358
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

494
02:13:55,559 --> 02:14:00,272
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

495
02:14:00,473 --> 02:14:04,444
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

496
02:14:04,658 --> 02:14:07,401
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

497
02:14:07,569 --> 02:14:10,690
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

498
02:14:10,891 --> 02:14:14,671
if they can get the same dinner set.

499
02:14:14,872 --> 02:14:19,294
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

500
02:14:19,495 --> 02:14:29,056
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

501
02:14:29,257 --> 02:14:33,108
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

502
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:37,344
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

503
02:14:37,545 --> 02:14:41,330
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

504
02:14:41,531 --> 02:14:48,926
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

505
02:14:49,214 --> 02:14:51,915
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

506
02:14:52,145 --> 02:14:54,948
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

507
02:14:55,149 --> 02:15:02,112
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

508
02:15:02,313 --> 02:15:08,234
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

509
02:15:08,956 --> 02:15:14,502
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

510
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:21,223
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

511
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:26,911
Just there you get it.

512
02:15:27,865 --> 02:15:33,345
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

513
02:15:33,555 --> 02:15:38,027
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

514
02:15:38,228 --> 02:15:41,744
if you don’t have greed about it.

515
02:15:41,951 --> 02:15:47,733
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

516
02:15:47,934 --> 02:15:54,439
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

517
02:15:54,640 --> 02:16:00,597
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

518
02:16:00,798 --> 02:16:06,891
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

519
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:14,805
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

520
02:16:15,177 --> 02:16:18,646
And then the thing also gets lost.

521
02:16:18,847 --> 02:16:26,094
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

522
02:16:26,432 --> 02:16:31,457
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

523
02:16:32,710 --> 02:16:36,421
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

524
02:16:36,622 --> 02:16:42,594
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

525
02:16:42,795 --> 02:16:48,394
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

526
02:16:48,595 --> 02:16:53,694
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

527
02:16:56,175 --> 02:17:05,541
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

528
02:17:11,603 --> 02:17:17,266
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

529
02:17:18,731 --> 02:17:24,583
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

530
02:17:24,784 --> 02:17:29,404
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

531
02:17:29,605 --> 02:17:36,407
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

532
02:17:38,049 --> 02:17:43,374
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

533
02:17:44,258 --> 02:17:46,847
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

534
02:17:47,048 --> 02:17:50,946
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

535
02:17:54,252 --> 02:17:58,747
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

536
02:18:04,927 --> 02:18:08,273
They are mostly from Russia.

537
02:18:09,985 --> 02:18:18,726
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

538
02:18:18,927 --> 02:18:23,971
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

539
02:18:24,172 --> 02:18:29,595
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

540
02:18:29,796 --> 02:18:33,679
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

541
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:39,028
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

542
02:18:39,606 --> 02:18:43,734
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

543
02:18:43,935 --> 02:18:49,250
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

544
02:18:49,451 --> 02:18:53,385
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

545
02:18:53,586 --> 02:18:57,823
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

546
02:18:58,031 --> 02:19:03,266
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

547
02:19:04,442 --> 02:19:10,594
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

548
02:19:10,795 --> 02:19:15,828
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

549
02:19:16,029 --> 02:19:18,925
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

550
02:19:19,126 --> 02:19:22,775
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

551
02:19:22,976 --> 02:19:28,285
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

552
02:19:28,486 --> 02:19:34,096
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

553
02:19:34,297 --> 02:19:41,102
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

554
02:19:41,303 --> 02:19:47,307
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

555
02:19:48,101 --> 02:19:52,694
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

556
02:19:52,895 --> 02:19:58,708
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

557
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:03,960
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

558
02:20:04,161 --> 02:20:08,131
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

559
02:20:08,332 --> 02:20:13,985
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

560
02:20:15,722 --> 02:20:25,561
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

561
02:20:25,762 --> 02:20:30,647
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

562
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:37,946
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

563
02:20:39,277 --> 02:20:44,604
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

564
02:20:44,805 --> 02:20:50,835
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

565
02:20:51,477 --> 02:20:56,527
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

566
02:20:56,728 --> 02:21:02,733
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

567
02:21:02,934 --> 02:21:08,070
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

568
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:12,959
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

569
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:17,597
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

570
02:21:17,798 --> 02:21:23,578
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

571
02:21:23,779 --> 02:21:29,192
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

572
02:21:29,393 --> 02:21:36,430
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

573
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:44,921
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

574
02:21:49,739 --> 02:21:57,294
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

575
02:21:57,495 --> 02:22:01,829
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

576
02:22:02,774 --> 02:22:07,913
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

577
02:22:08,114 --> 02:22:11,362
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

578
02:22:11,563 --> 02:22:14,742
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

579
02:22:14,943 --> 02:22:21,047
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

580
02:22:21,248 --> 02:22:24,368
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

581
02:22:24,569 --> 02:22:28,201
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

582
02:22:28,402 --> 02:22:32,148
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

583
02:22:32,349 --> 02:22:40,397
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

584
02:22:40,598 --> 02:22:45,005
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

585
02:22:45,206 --> 02:22:52,667
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

586
02:22:52,868 --> 02:22:57,824
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

587
02:22:58,025 --> 02:23:00,711
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

588
02:23:00,925 --> 02:23:04,857
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

589
02:23:05,058 --> 02:23:08,865
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

590
02:23:09,066 --> 02:23:11,531
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

591
02:23:11,732 --> 02:23:18,216
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

592
02:23:18,417 --> 02:23:25,550
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

593
02:23:25,751 --> 02:23:32,753
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

594
02:23:32,954 --> 02:23:36,379
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

595
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:41,370
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

596
02:23:41,532 --> 02:23:45,620
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

597
02:23:45,821 --> 02:23:51,649
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

598
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:57,305
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

599
02:23:57,530 --> 02:24:01,234
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

600
02:24:01,435 --> 02:24:07,569
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

601
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:12,825
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

602
02:24:13,026 --> 02:24:17,315
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

603
02:24:17,516 --> 02:24:21,760
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

604
02:24:21,961 --> 02:24:29,419
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

605
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:33,390
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

606
02:24:33,591 --> 02:24:38,304
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

607
02:24:38,505 --> 02:24:41,248
that we have got the Spirit within us.

608
02:24:41,449 --> 02:24:46,979
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

609
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:50,670
You are people who are all realized souls.

610
02:24:50,871 --> 02:24:55,740
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

611
02:24:55,941 --> 02:25:00,312
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

612
02:25:00,513 --> 02:25:08,129
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

613
02:25:08,330 --> 02:25:12,236
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

614
02:25:12,436 --> 02:25:19,427
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

615
02:25:19,628 --> 02:25:24,291
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

616
02:25:24,492 --> 02:25:29,575
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

617
02:25:29,776 --> 02:25:32,980
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

618
02:25:33,181 --> 02:25:40,218
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

619
02:25:41,224 --> 02:25:44,829
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

620
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:47,070
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

621
02:25:47,271 --> 02:25:51,761
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

622
02:25:51,962 --> 02:25:58,109
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

623
02:25:58,310 --> 02:26:05,319
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

624
02:26:05,652 --> 02:26:11,831
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

625
02:26:12,032 --> 02:26:17,027
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

626
02:26:17,228 --> 02:26:23,360
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

627
02:26:23,561 --> 02:26:27,990
it is absolutely a hell for man.

628
02:26:29,316 --> 02:26:35,237
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

629
02:26:35,438 --> 02:26:41,427
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

630
02:26:41,628 --> 02:26:46,499
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

631
02:26:46,644 --> 02:26:49,985
What pleases the husband?

632
02:26:51,497 --> 02:26:54,884
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

633
02:26:55,085 --> 02:27:00,779
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

634
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:05,843
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

635
02:27:06,044 --> 02:27:09,704
First of all find out what he likes.

636
02:27:11,432 --> 02:27:14,399
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

637
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:17,465
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

638
02:27:17,666 --> 02:27:22,208
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

639
02:27:22,409 --> 02:27:27,904
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

640
02:27:28,105 --> 02:27:33,776
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

641
02:27:33,977 --> 02:27:37,332
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

642
02:27:37,533 --> 02:27:40,961
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

643
02:27:41,162 --> 02:27:48,044
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

644
02:27:48,245 --> 02:27:51,734
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

645
02:27:51,911 --> 02:27:56,022
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

646
02:27:56,223 --> 02:28:00,797
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

647
02:28:00,998 --> 02:28:04,430
because women are responsible
for the society.

648
02:28:04,631 --> 02:28:10,909
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

649
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:15,725
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

650
02:28:15,926 --> 02:28:21,401
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

651
02:28:21,602 --> 02:28:26,021
But your job is to make the society.

652
02:28:26,222 --> 02:28:30,781
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

653
02:28:30,982 --> 02:28:35,365
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

654
02:28:35,566 --> 02:28:40,998
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

655
02:28:41,199 --> 02:28:43,802
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

656
02:28:44,003 --> 02:28:52,862
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

657
02:28:53,719 --> 02:28:59,415
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

658
02:29:01,125 --> 02:29:07,524
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

659
02:29:07,725 --> 02:29:13,312
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

660
02:29:13,513 --> 02:29:16,488
But there was one gentleman, good one,

661
02:29:16,689 --> 02:29:20,659
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

662
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:24,710
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

663
02:29:24,911 --> 02:29:31,806
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

664
02:29:32,580 --> 02:29:35,543
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

665
02:29:35,744 --> 02:29:38,568
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

666
02:29:38,769 --> 02:29:45,596
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

667
02:29:45,797 --> 02:29:49,994
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

668
02:29:50,195 --> 02:29:55,568
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

669
02:29:55,769 --> 02:30:00,275
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

670
02:30:00,476 --> 02:30:05,074
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

671
02:30:05,275 --> 02:30:10,028
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

672
02:30:10,229 --> 02:30:14,154
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

673
02:30:14,355 --> 02:30:18,220
Immediately this competition.

674
02:30:23,655 --> 02:30:26,756
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

675
02:30:26,957 --> 02:30:29,922
even in London he was helping him a lot.

676
02:30:30,123 --> 02:30:36,074
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

677
02:30:36,275 --> 02:30:40,776
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

678
02:30:42,583 --> 02:30:46,479
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

679
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,160
Otherwise for small, small things,

680
02:30:50,361 --> 02:30:54,944
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

681
02:30:55,145 --> 02:31:01,577
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

682
02:31:03,022 --> 02:31:07,799
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

683
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:12,741
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

684
02:31:12,942 --> 02:31:18,482
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

685
02:31:18,683 --> 02:31:24,318
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

686
02:31:24,519 --> 02:31:26,890
 [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

687
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:31,666
she was married to somebody in USA.

688
02:31:31,867 --> 02:31:39,221
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

689
02:31:39,422 --> 02:31:42,899
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

690
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:50,165
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

691
02:31:50,366 --> 02:31:56,697
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

692
02:31:56,898 --> 02:32:02,337
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

693
02:32:02,538 --> 02:32:07,923
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

694
02:32:08,124 --> 02:32:11,835
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

695
02:32:12,036 --> 02:32:17,110
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

696
02:32:17,311 --> 02:32:20,877
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

697
02:32:21,061 --> 02:32:27,595
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

698
02:32:27,796 --> 02:32:31,735
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

699
02:32:32,668 --> 02:32:42,301
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

700
02:32:42,502 --> 02:32:45,430
Why has he married?

701
02:32:45,631 --> 02:32:52,616
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

702
02:32:56,215 --> 02:32:58,607
 It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

703
02:32:58,808 --> 02:33:03,776
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

704
02:33:03,977 --> 02:33:07,227
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

705
02:33:07,428 --> 02:33:12,339
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

706
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:16,831
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

707
02:33:17,313 --> 02:33:22,857
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

708
02:33:23,024 --> 02:33:28,095
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

709
02:33:28,296 --> 02:33:31,440
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

710
02:33:31,641 --> 02:33:35,574
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

711
02:33:35,775 --> 02:33:42,161
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

712
02:33:42,362 --> 02:33:47,785
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

713
02:33:47,986 --> 02:33:52,281
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

714
02:33:53,442 --> 02:33:58,790
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

715
02:33:58,967 --> 02:34:02,950
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

716
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:10,484
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

717
02:34:12,623 --> 02:34:16,613
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

718
02:34:16,814 --> 02:34:19,486
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

719
02:34:19,687 --> 02:34:22,504
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

720
02:34:22,705 --> 02:34:28,041
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

721
02:34:30,220 --> 02:34:36,209
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

722
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:41,270
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

723
02:34:45,481 --> 02:34:48,619
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

724
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:52,567
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

725
02:34:52,768 --> 02:34:57,064
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

726
02:34:57,265 --> 02:35:02,498
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

727
02:35:04,136 --> 02:35:07,529
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

728
02:35:07,730 --> 02:35:11,211
try to understand why she does it.

729
02:35:11,412 --> 02:35:16,216
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

730
02:35:16,417 --> 02:35:22,004
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

731
02:35:22,205 --> 02:35:27,117
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

732
02:35:27,318 --> 02:35:32,798
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

733
02:35:32,999 --> 02:35:38,978
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

734
02:35:39,179 --> 02:35:43,431
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

735
02:35:43,632 --> 02:35:47,590
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

736
02:35:47,791 --> 02:35:52,245
and he is not there and this and that.”

737
02:35:52,561 --> 02:35:55,902
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

738
02:35:56,103 --> 02:36:01,508
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

739
02:36:01,709 --> 02:36:05,737
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

740
02:36:05,938 --> 02:36:08,728
I can’t understand the logic.

741
02:36:08,929 --> 02:36:13,426
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

742
02:36:13,627 --> 02:36:19,138
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

743
02:36:19,804 --> 02:36:28,408
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

744
02:36:28,609 --> 02:36:34,758
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

745
02:36:36,365 --> 02:36:38,951
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

746
02:36:39,152 --> 02:36:43,967
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

747
02:36:44,168 --> 02:36:49,516
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

748
02:36:49,717 --> 02:36:54,261
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

749
02:36:54,462 --> 02:36:59,726
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

750
02:36:59,927 --> 02:37:04,090
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

751
02:37:04,291 --> 02:37:07,546
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

752
02:37:08,197 --> 02:37:14,200
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

753
02:37:14,401 --> 02:37:18,031
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

754
02:37:18,232 --> 02:37:23,301
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

755
02:37:23,486 --> 02:37:27,270
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

756
02:37:27,471 --> 02:37:30,078
So, with such an ignorance of things,

757
02:37:30,279 --> 02:37:35,194
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

758
02:37:36,714 --> 02:37:44,051
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

759
02:37:44,252 --> 02:37:48,832
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

760
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:57,268
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

761
02:37:57,531 --> 02:38:00,380
He buys always very expensive things.

762
02:38:00,581 --> 02:38:04,816
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

763
02:38:05,017 --> 02:38:10,068
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

764
02:38:10,269 --> 02:38:15,651
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

765
02:38:15,852 --> 02:38:20,794
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

766
02:38:20,995 --> 02:38:26,099
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

767
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:32,063
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

768
02:38:32,264 --> 02:38:36,414
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

769
02:38:36,591 --> 02:38:40,233
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

770
02:38:40,434 --> 02:38:44,156
but he likes to give that only – all right.

771
02:38:44,357 --> 02:38:49,012
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

772
02:38:49,213 --> 02:38:53,166
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

773
02:38:53,367 --> 02:38:58,987
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

774
02:38:59,188 --> 02:39:04,020
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

775
02:39:04,221 --> 02:39:10,888
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

776
02:39:11,089 --> 02:39:17,626
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

777
02:39:17,827 --> 02:39:20,760
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

778
02:39:20,961 --> 02:39:25,630
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

779
02:39:25,831 --> 02:39:29,405
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

780
02:39:29,606 --> 02:39:33,515
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

781
02:39:33,716 --> 02:39:36,767
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

782
02:39:36,968 --> 02:39:40,339
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

783
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:46,321
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

784
02:39:46,522 --> 02:39:51,693
[Hindi aside]

785
02:39:51,903 --> 02:39:55,133
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

786
02:39:55,347 --> 02:39:59,269
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

787
02:39:59,470 --> 02:40:03,361
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

788
02:40:03,562 --> 02:40:07,883
I was walking like a giant, you know.

789
02:40:14,112 --> 02:40:18,435
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

790
02:40:18,636 --> 02:40:22,671
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

791
02:40:22,872 --> 02:40:25,948
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

792
02:40:26,149 --> 02:40:30,380
I sat in one place glued down into that.

793
02:40:30,581 --> 02:40:35,840
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

794
02:40:36,041 --> 02:40:41,552
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

795
02:40:41,753 --> 02:40:45,140
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

796
02:40:45,341 --> 02:40:49,274
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

797
02:40:49,475 --> 02:40:55,370
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

798
02:40:56,124 --> 02:40:58,648
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

799
02:40:58,813 --> 02:41:03,694
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

800
02:41:03,895 --> 02:41:06,578
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

801
02:41:06,779 --> 02:41:13,107
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

802
02:41:13,331 --> 02:41:19,860
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

803
02:41:20,061 --> 02:41:24,934
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

804
02:41:25,135 --> 02:41:28,374
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

805
02:41:28,575 --> 02:41:31,672
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

806
02:41:31,872 --> 02:41:37,364
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

807
02:41:37,565 --> 02:41:40,510
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

808
02:41:40,711 --> 02:41:44,198
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

809
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:49,355
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

810
02:41:52,351 --> 02:41:54,543
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

811
02:41:54,744 --> 02:41:57,488
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

812
02:41:57,689 --> 02:42:02,804
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

813
02:42:03,005 --> 02:42:05,704
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

814
02:42:05,905 --> 02:42:11,856
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

815
02:42:12,057 --> 02:42:16,742
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

816
02:42:16,943 --> 02:42:22,580
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

817
02:42:22,766 --> 02:42:24,378
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

818
02:42:24,579 --> 02:42:27,668
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

819
02:42:27,869 --> 02:42:31,639
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

820
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:36,046
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

821
02:42:36,247 --> 02:42:40,824
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

822
02:42:41,025 --> 02:42:45,955
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

823
02:42:48,109 --> 02:42:52,384
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

824
02:42:52,569 --> 02:42:58,517
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

825
02:42:58,718 --> 02:43:02,653
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

826
02:43:02,854 --> 02:43:08,841
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

827
02:43:09,042 --> 02:43:11,427
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

828
02:43:11,628 --> 02:43:16,308
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

829
02:43:16,483 --> 02:43:20,673
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

830
02:43:20,873 --> 02:43:23,778
You are not going to beat (them).

831
02:43:24,856 --> 02:43:30,095
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

832
02:43:30,296 --> 02:43:33,223
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

833
02:43:33,424 --> 02:43:37,197
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

834
02:43:37,398 --> 02:43:41,207
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

835
02:43:41,408 --> 02:43:45,066
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

836
02:43:45,267 --> 02:43:49,990
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

837
02:43:50,191 --> 02:43:57,208
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

838
02:43:57,409 --> 02:44:01,883
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

839
02:44:02,091 --> 02:44:10,333
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

840
02:44:10,534 --> 02:44:15,914
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

841
02:44:16,115 --> 02:44:22,537
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

842
02:44:22,744 --> 02:44:26,227
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

843
02:44:26,428 --> 02:44:28,994
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

844
02:44:29,195 --> 02:44:34,268
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

845
02:44:34,469 --> 02:44:37,012
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

846
02:44:37,213 --> 02:44:42,417
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

847
02:44:42,618 --> 02:44:49,228
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

848
02:44:49,429 --> 02:44:52,250
In India no woman will do that.

849
02:44:52,451 --> 02:44:56,810
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

850
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:08,438
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

851
02:45:08,639 --> 02:45:11,871
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

852
02:45:12,072 --> 02:45:16,261
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

853
02:45:16,462 --> 02:45:19,360
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

854
02:45:19,561 --> 02:45:25,846
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

855
02:45:26,047 --> 02:45:29,438
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

856
02:45:29,639 --> 02:45:32,459
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

857
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:36,520
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

858
02:45:36,721 --> 02:45:40,531
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

859
02:45:40,732 --> 02:45:47,877
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

860
02:45:48,078 --> 02:45:52,131
But this Western women never understand.

861
02:45:52,332 --> 02:45:58,346
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

862
02:45:58,546 --> 02:46:03,997
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

863
02:46:04,198 --> 02:46:07,709
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

864
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:12,021
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

865
02:46:12,222 --> 02:46:16,876
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

866
02:46:17,077 --> 02:46:22,277
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

867
02:46:22,478 --> 02:46:30,858
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

868
02:46:31,059 --> 02:46:38,492
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

869
02:46:38,693 --> 02:46:41,906
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

870
02:46:42,107 --> 02:46:47,914
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

871
02:46:48,115 --> 02:46:50,768
This is very Western, I must say.

872
02:46:50,969 --> 02:46:57,808
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

873
02:46:58,086 --> 02:47:03,705
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

874
02:47:03,906 --> 02:47:07,677
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

875
02:47:07,878 --> 02:47:11,957
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

876
02:47:12,158 --> 02:47:15,690
This is not the way a woman should look.

877
02:47:15,891 --> 02:47:20,601
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

878
02:47:20,802 --> 02:47:27,028
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

879
02:47:27,229 --> 02:47:34,742
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

880
02:47:34,943 --> 02:47:39,572
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

881
02:47:39,773 --> 02:47:43,893
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

882
02:47:44,094 --> 02:47:47,138
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

883
02:47:47,339 --> 02:47:57,542
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

884
02:47:57,743 --> 02:48:05,348
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

885
02:48:09,751 --> 02:48:14,954
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

886
02:48:15,139 --> 02:48:17,566
Who are you to like or not like?

887
02:48:17,767 --> 02:48:22,704
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

888
02:48:22,905 --> 02:48:29,095
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

889
02:48:29,304 --> 02:48:37,099
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

890
02:48:37,300 --> 02:48:41,885
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

891
02:48:42,086 --> 02:48:46,595
and should have very, very large hearts.

892
02:48:50,195 --> 02:48:58,806
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

893
02:48:59,007 --> 02:49:02,211
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

894
02:49:02,412 --> 02:49:08,226
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

895
02:49:10,743 --> 02:49:15,924
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

896
02:49:16,125 --> 02:49:23,138
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

897
02:49:23,339 --> 02:49:28,195
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

898
02:49:28,396 --> 02:49:31,502
very, very good reports about them.

899
02:49:31,703 --> 02:49:36,606
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

900
02:49:36,807 --> 02:49:39,966
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

901
02:49:40,167 --> 02:49:46,138
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

902
02:49:46,339 --> 02:49:53,937
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

903
02:49:54,138 --> 02:49:56,989
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

904
02:49:57,190 --> 02:50:00,755
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

905
02:50:01,323 --> 02:50:04,038
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

906
02:50:04,239 --> 02:50:07,925
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

907
02:50:08,126 --> 02:50:12,917
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

908
02:50:13,118 --> 02:50:16,865
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

909
02:50:17,066 --> 02:50:21,335
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

910
02:50:21,536 --> 02:50:24,766
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

911
02:50:24,967 --> 02:50:29,367
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

912
02:50:29,599 --> 02:50:35,880
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

913
02:50:36,050 --> 02:50:39,194
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

914
02:50:39,395 --> 02:50:44,900
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

915
02:50:45,101 --> 02:50:47,621
thanks to Swiss influence.

916
02:50:47,822 --> 02:50:52,796
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

917
02:50:53,003 --> 02:50:58,480
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

918
02:50:58,681 --> 02:51:03,263
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

919
02:51:08,501 --> 02:51:12,516
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

920
02:51:12,717 --> 02:51:18,042
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

921
02:51:18,243 --> 02:51:25,144
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

922
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:29,622
This is the book. You all should buy it.

923
02:51:29,823 --> 02:51:33,237
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

924
02:51:33,438 --> 02:51:36,756
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

925
02:51:59,176 --> 02:52:02,442
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

926
02:52:02,643 --> 02:52:06,223
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

927
02:52:06,424 --> 02:52:11,273
So, you will understand about Indian music.

928
02:52:11,474 --> 02:52:17,672
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

929
02:52:18,106 --> 02:52:24,987
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

930
02:52:25,188 --> 02:52:31,439
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

931
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:36,376
who were singing western song, was alright.

932
02:52:36,577 --> 02:52:41,711
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

933
02:52:41,912 --> 02:52:45,154
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

934
02:52:45,355 --> 02:52:48,952
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

935
02:52:49,153 --> 02:52:53,221
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

936
02:52:53,422 --> 02:52:56,869
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

937
02:52:57,070 --> 02:53:01,310
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

938
02:53:01,511 --> 02:53:05,620
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

939
02:53:05,797 --> 02:53:11,318
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

940
02:53:11,519 --> 02:53:19,381
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

941
02:53:19,582 --> 02:53:23,218
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

942
02:53:23,419 --> 02:53:29,818
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

943
02:53:30,019 --> 02:53:34,188
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

944
02:53:34,389 --> 02:53:36,947
They are having all this horrible music
there.

945
02:53:37,148 --> 02:53:42,568
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

946
02:53:42,769 --> 02:53:46,954
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

947
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:54,277
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

948
02:53:54,445 --> 02:53:58,784
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

949
02:53:58,985 --> 02:54:02,884
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

950
02:54:03,085 --> 02:54:05,715
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

951
02:54:05,916 --> 02:54:10,873
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

952
02:54:11,073 --> 02:54:15,854
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

953
02:54:16,079 --> 02:54:19,514
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

954
02:54:19,715 --> 02:54:24,209
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

955
02:54:24,410 --> 02:54:34,086
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

956
02:54:34,287 --> 02:54:40,731
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

957
02:54:40,932 --> 02:54:51,760
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

958
02:54:51,961 --> 02:54:56,507
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

959
02:54:56,708 --> 02:55:02,694
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

960
02:55:02,894 --> 02:55:04,835
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

961
02:55:05,036 --> 02:55:08,945
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

962
02:55:09,146 --> 02:55:13,319
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

963
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:16,964
you will see how different it will be.

964
02:55:19,101 --> 02:55:22,685
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

965
02:55:22,886 --> 02:55:25,530
which you should have, and which you should
understand

966
02:55:25,731 --> 02:55:34,966
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

967
02:55:35,167 --> 02:55:41,464
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

968
02:55:41,665 --> 02:55:46,902
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

969
02:55:47,063 --> 02:55:53,106
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

970
02:55:54,555 --> 02:55:58,184
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

971
02:55:58,385 --> 02:56:02,367
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

972
02:56:02,568 --> 02:56:07,962
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

973
02:56:08,163 --> 02:56:10,911
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

974
02:56:11,112 --> 02:56:14,804
Then you can expand it as you like.

975
02:56:15,005 --> 02:56:21,129
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

976
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:25,594
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

977
02:56:25,795 --> 02:56:32,073
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

978
02:56:32,361 --> 02:56:38,925
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

979
02:56:39,457 --> 02:56:41,796
Accha.

980
02:56:41,997 --> 02:56:46,764
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

981
02:56:46,965 --> 02:56:53,338
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

982
02:56:53,539 --> 02:57:03,260
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

983
02:57:03,687 --> 02:57:11,823
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

984
02:57:15,861 --> 02:57:20,764
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

985
02:57:20,965 --> 02:57:28,054
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

986
02:57:28,255 --> 02:57:36,504
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

987
02:57:36,705 --> 02:57:43,441
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

988
02:57:43,642 --> 02:57:51,962
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

989
02:57:52,163 --> 02:58:00,229
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

990
02:58:00,430 --> 02:58:05,337
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

991
02:58:05,512 --> 02:58:09,628
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

992
02:58:09,829 --> 02:58:16,453
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

993
02:58:16,654 --> 02:58:22,010
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

994
02:58:22,383 --> 02:58:29,182
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

995
02:58:29,383 --> 02:58:36,959
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

996
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:43,665
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

997
02:58:43,866 --> 02:58:49,655
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

998
02:58:49,856 --> 02:58:53,162
Because when you try to do something wrong

999
02:58:53,363 --> 02:58:57,459
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

1000
02:59:00,141 --> 02:59:04,428
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

1001
02:59:04,629 --> 02:59:10,513
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

1002
02:59:10,714 --> 02:59:16,578
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

1003
02:59:16,779 --> 02:59:20,435
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

1004
02:59:20,636 --> 02:59:25,497
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

1005
02:59:25,698 --> 02:59:29,882
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

1006
02:59:30,083 --> 02:59:35,021
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

1007
02:59:35,222 --> 02:59:38,662
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

1008
02:59:38,863 --> 02:59:42,350
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

1009
02:59:42,551 --> 02:59:48,116
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

1010
02:59:49,890 --> 02:59:55,964
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

1011
02:59:56,165 --> 03:00:00,509
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

1012
03:00:00,709 --> 03:00:04,416
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

1013
03:00:04,617 --> 03:00:09,700
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

1014
03:00:09,901 --> 03:00:14,484
than father, mother, even Mataji.

1015
03:00:15,785 --> 03:00:20,714
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

1016
03:00:21,654 --> 03:00:23,927
So, thank you very much.
