1
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,843
Sydney, Australia

3
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,837
April 4, 1981

4
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:15,281
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

5
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:22,324
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

6
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,212
This day has never been celebrated before

7
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,968
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

8
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,374
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

9
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:40,849
because this is the New Year’s Day

10
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,852
of the Shalivahan calendar.

11
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:48,345
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

12
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,870
and they are called as Shalivahan

13
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,700
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

14
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,826
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

15
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,799
so many times My shawls around.

16
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:03,305
And they were called as Shalivahan.

17
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:12,221
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

18
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,426
the nine days there are.

19
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:23,916
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

20
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:29,232
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

21
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,894
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

22
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,248
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

23
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:45,177
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

24
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,698
when She incarnated on this Earth.

25
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:53,950
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

26
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:58,971
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

27
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:13,625
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

28
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,021
just starting this week.

29
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,825
What is the day? The day today is …?

30
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,280
[Today’s the fourth.]

31
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,481
 Today ….

32
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,123
[Saturday, Mother.]

33
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,842
[Saturday.]

34
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:32,071
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

35
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:34,477
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

36
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,389
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

37
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,357
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

38
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,692
and when you take My photograph

39
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:44,556
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

40
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,922
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

41
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:50,598
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

42
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,911
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

43
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,347
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

44
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:58,558
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

45
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,915
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

46
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,216
[Hindi]

47
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:19,681
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

48
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:26,356
and then the Goddess started working.

49
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:32,494
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

50
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,339
She started working out on Wednesday.

51
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,418
Wednesday is the action day,

52
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,209
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

53
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,586
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

54
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:50,154
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

55
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:56,966
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

56
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,690
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

57
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:06,295
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

58
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:09,088
Wednesday is the second day.

59
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:14,021
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

60
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:18,673
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

61
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:23,491
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

62
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:30,757
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

63
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:41,769
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

64
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,259
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

65
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,975
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

66
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:54,377
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

67
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,916
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

68
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:01,205
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

69
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,648
Venus.

70
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,213
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

71
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:14,679
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

72
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,815
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

73
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:31,308
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

74
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,965
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

75
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,767
is of realization, of integration.

76
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,135
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

77
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:52,570
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

78
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,977
you cannot understand Christianity.

79
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:58,990
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

80
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,030
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

81
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:06,426
then only you will understand what Christ said.

82
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:11,707
So today is the day of – first day –

83
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,366
of when Ganesha was created,

84
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:21,702
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

85
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:27,505
but according to dates of the moon,

86
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:35,327
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

87
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,063
[Marathi]

88
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:41,138
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

89
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,072
And this is the time when –

90
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:46,753
[Marathi]

91
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,758
Gauri is the Chaitra.

92
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,176
So the establishment of the Gauri

93
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,064
is taken place during these nine days.

94
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:03,199
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

95
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,728
Though first Gauri had to come,

96
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:11,327
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

97
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:15,569
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

98
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:22,118
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

99
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,105
nothing starts;

100
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,471
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

101
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:30,441
all the negativities,

102
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,151
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

103
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:38,094
all the attentions that are here and there.

104
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,830
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

105
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,786
just to ask Him to protect us.

106
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,749
But first the Gauri has to come,

107
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,796
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

108
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:57,929
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

109
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:05,999
negativity, for people to transcend

110
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,797
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

111
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:14,567
the maya, the illusion.

112
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:19,016
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

113
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,901
people used to obstruct

114
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:27,249
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

115
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,791
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

116
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:36,677
and the saints were separate;

117
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,675
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

118
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:43,156
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

119
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:46,539
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

120
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,578
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

121
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,172
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

122
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,588
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

123
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,434
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

124
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:01,256
so we are not absolute saints.

125
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:04,711
 And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

126
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,975
even when you are worshipping Me,

127
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:11,346
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

128
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:14,792
Try to be more on the saintly side.

129
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,272
Because you are saints, no doubt,

130
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:21,216
but these horrible things have somehow or other

131
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,825
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

132
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,735
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

133
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:31,766
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

134
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:37,219
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

135
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,579
kalanka.

136
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,999
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

137
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,110
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

138
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,885
be one with the puja.

139
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:57,214
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

140
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:03,728
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

141
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:07,878
It was to be in Australia.

142
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,872
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

143
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:14,713
celebrated here.

144
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:25,697
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

145
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,215
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

146
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,072
over nine days we have done.

147
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:32,265
But never this Navaratri as such

148
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:36,415
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

149
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:40,425
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

150
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,411
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

151
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:49,969
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

152
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:56,615
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

153
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:03,778
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

154
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:15,556
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

155
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:22,905
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

156
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,756
our heights,

157
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:28,733
in our realization.

158
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,900
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

159
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,170
we are rising high;

160
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,755
so He preserves and He protects.

161
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:44,769
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

162
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,716
to have our ascent in such a way

163
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:55,225
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

164
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:58,241
we have full dignity;

165
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:04,138
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

166
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:07,686
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

167
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:11,112
and do it with our heart genuinely.

168
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:15,055
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

169
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,576
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

170
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,084
that is, the Kundalini.

171
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:25,620
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

172
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,759
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

173
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:35,713
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

174
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,448
because this is the color of Australia.

175
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:43,744
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

176
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:47,738
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

177
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:51,452
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

178
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:57,004
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

179
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,585
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

180
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,772
So this one also is just the other way round,

181
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:06,832
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

182
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:10,927
This is a very traditional combination

183
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:16,378
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

184
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:24,621
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

185
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:27,059
can become absolutely black,

186
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,172
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

187
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:40,822
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

188
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:44,387
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

189
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:49,611
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

190
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:55,572
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

191
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,915
and that’s why the color is green

192
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:01,155
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

193
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:04,610
at least She’s covered with.

194
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,681
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

195
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,555
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

196
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:14,841
element is the Mother Earth.

197
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:21,967
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

198
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:26,736
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

199
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,680
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

200
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:34,966
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

201
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,175
It is said this ….

202
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:40,804
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

203
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,484
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

204
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:44,544
What’s she say?

205
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,638
[They cannot hear.]

206
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,064
 You can’t hear Me?e …]

207
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,265
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

208
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,214
 All right, so I’ll have to shout.

209
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,091
Not at all?

210
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,642
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

211
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:58,560
All right. Should I use this?

212
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,132
 All right. This you can hear.

213
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:11,361
So I’m now going to tell you

214
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,507
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

215
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:19,074
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

216
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:23,419
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

217
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,867
they don’t know what they are talking.

218
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:29,660
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

219
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:32,290
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

220
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:37,701
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

221
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,227
So He’s the first one created.

222
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,608
Now it’s very symbolic:

223
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:49,881
the pure power

224
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:57,582
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

225
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:02,388
The primordial Gauri is that power

226
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,563
which has separated from Her Lord,

227
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,588
we can say.

228
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:14,061
In Her previous lives She was separated,

229
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:17,924
and again She’s born as Parvati.

230
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:23,593
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

231
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,926
So now the marriage has taken place,

232
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:31,860
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

233
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:35,506
The wedding kindling has to start.

234
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,886
But She’s not yet married,

235
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,972
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

236
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:48,417
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

237
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:52,844
Before that She wants to have a bath,

238
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,985
because She has to meet Her Lord.

239
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,734
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

240
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:05,099
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

241
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:09,055
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

242
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:12,177
when She’s having Her bath.

243
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,346
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

244
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:20,256
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

245
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:22,734
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

246
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:26,552
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

247
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,647
So She closes the door,

248
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:35,699
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

249
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:46,948
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

250
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,431
for the bride specially it is the right one,

251
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:53,385
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

252
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:56,795
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

253
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:01,253
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

254
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,789
She puts that – is made of camphor

255
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,961
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

256
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:16,701
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

257
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:22,441
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

258
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:25,673
She’s having Her bath nicely.

259
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:30,971
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

260
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:33,523
She doesn’t hear Him.

261
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:39,606
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

262
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,889
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

263
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,679
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

264
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,640
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

265
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,704
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

266
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:57,774
See now the Immaculate Conception,

267
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,293
try to understand.

268
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:08,440
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

269
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:13,443
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

270
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:18,155
So He cuts His neck in anger,

271
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,958
and He enters into the bathroom.

272
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,039
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

273
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:29,185
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

274
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:34,190
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

275
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:39,119
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

276
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,357
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

277
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,236
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

278
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:49,265
How dare You kill Him?”

279
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,654
She said, “ Now what to do?”

280
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:54,466
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

281
00:25:54,667 --> 00:26:02,231
and find the head of any animal that is available,

282
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:06,583
and we will put that on this trunk

283
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,399
and He’ll be My son again.”

284
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,759
Now it’s all prearranged;

285
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:18,878
because this child was not to grow into

286
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,961
a human ego and superego business.

287
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:26,333
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

288
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:31,869
embodiment of childlike innocence,

289
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,118
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

290
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,880
So they had to get the head of an animal.

291
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:48,006
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

292
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,778
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

293
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,705
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

294
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,823
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

295
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:03,907
was lying down with her back towards her child,

296
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:07,655
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

297
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,999
towards their children, never.

298
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,836
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

299
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:17,329
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

300
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,050
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

301
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:23,819
but she would never put the child at the back.

302
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,715
So the head of that little animal was cut,

303
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:31,934
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

304
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:35,931
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

305
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:45,513
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

306
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,465
So the body is from Mahakali,

307
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:57,166
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

308
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:09,229
Now this Ganesha within us resides

309
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,430
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

310
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,735
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

311
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:24,256
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

312
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:27,067
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

313
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:30,734
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

314
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,513
and that’s how they started all these perversions

315
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,160
and wrong things about Ganesha.

316
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:39,943
But He is embodiment of innocence,

317
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:44,551
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

318
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,759
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

319
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:54,871
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

320
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,846
on this Earth as Kalki.

321
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:00,689
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

322
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,854
such a dynamic personality like Him,

323
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:06,505
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

324
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,425
And it is impossible,

325
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,654
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

326
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:15,840
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

327
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:21,844
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

328
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,199
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

329
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,340
who has no power to kill anyone.

330
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,039
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

331
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:37,806
I don’t know how they manage these things.

332
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,418
They catch hold of one thing,

333
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,892
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

334
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:48,588
now how are they authorized, God knows?

335
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,189
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

336
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,568
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

337
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,813
He said it in such a good way,

338
00:29:58,014 --> 00:30:01,785
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

339
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:05,325
that “Those who are,

340
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:08,316
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

341
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,266
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

342
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:15,150
very clearly. Why did He say so?

343
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:19,364
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

344
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:22,140
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

345
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:25,152
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

346
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:28,351
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

347
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:30,442
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

348
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:33,427
you have a special right.

349
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:36,380
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

350
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:40,864
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

351
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:45,252
because you have spoilt your innocence.

352
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,216
They have not spoilt their innocence.

353
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:51,359
So though you may call yourself Christians,

354
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,465
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

355
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,211
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

356
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,961
which we have ruined.

357
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,919
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

358
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,213
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

359
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:10,759
a conditioning;

360
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:17,216
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

361
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,060
You must re-establish your innocence.

362
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:25,583
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

363
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:29,199
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

364
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,596
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

365
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:37,485
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

366
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:40,435
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

367
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:43,343
we could not fall into anything.

368
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:46,914
India is like, large like an elephant.

369
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,922
 Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

370
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:52,010
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

371
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,739
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

372
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,751
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

373
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,905
we never accepted him.

374
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:03,284
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

375
00:32:03,485 --> 00:32:07,724
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

376
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,084
so nothing got into their heads.

377
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,119
They never spoiled their innocence,

378
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,679
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

379
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,640
to new ideas.

380
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,824
And that’s how they have, despite everything

381
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,899
they are not converted Christians,

382
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,924
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

383
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,280
They have maintained their innocence much more

384
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:32,972
and their sincerity of their heart,

385
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:35,662
because they are not disconnected.

386
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,999
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

387
00:32:38,183 --> 00:32:42,148
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

388
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:45,079
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

389
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,280
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

390
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:51,025
they know in their – that it is wrong.

391
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:53,023
They may try, I mean, like people steal

392
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:57,226
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

393
00:32:57,427 --> 00:33:02,769
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

394
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:09,493
our position as innocent people.

395
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:13,043
But your Mother is very gracious,

396
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:16,848
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

397
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,892
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

398
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:27,339
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

399
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,087
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

400
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:34,038
that you can come so close to Me.

401
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:39,903
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

402
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:48,268
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

403
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,523
but Shri Ganesha.

404
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:58,254
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

405
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,009
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

406
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,640
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

407
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:09,061
you have no idea at all.

408
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:15,301
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

409
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:19,260
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

410
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,913
that is being also established.

411
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:24,604
You’ll get back your innocence.

412
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:28,701
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

413
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,267
one has to learn, that

414
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:34,751
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

415
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:38,905
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

416
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:41,695
He’s so dedicated.

417
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:46,261
There’s a story once when Parvati,

418
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:50,141
His Mother gave –

419
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:55,435
said that “I will give You a big present,

420
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,482
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

421
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:02,647
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

422
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:06,949
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

423
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,049
Is the, all the destructive powers

424
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,998
were combined to create Kartikeya.

425
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,696
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

426
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:21,740
I’ll give You a prize.”

427
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,854
So, the conveyance of

428
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:31,462
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

429
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:36,045
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

430
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:41,525
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

431
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,944
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

432
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:49,090
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

433
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:52,079
She has created all the gods.

434
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,372
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

435
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,225
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

436
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:01,409
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

437
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,767
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

438
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:08,821
only thrice and He got the prize.

439
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:13,279
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

440
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:16,904
He fought even Shiva.

441
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:20,049
He fought everyone.

442
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:23,519
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

443
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,509
that shows complete dedication.

444
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,834
 And for Sahaja yogis

445
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:35,481
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

446
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:41,955
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

447
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:47,833
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

448
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:51,401
that’s important, though I am so close.

449
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:57,322
Even Christ would not say anything;

450
00:36:57,523 --> 00:37:02,671
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

451
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:05,290
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

452
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:10,166
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

453
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,406
But you forget.

454
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:19,293
So it is important to understand that they were great

455
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:24,391
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

456
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,952
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

457
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:30,590
which Raul Bai will teach you,

458
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,603
so that you do not make any mistakes

459
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:37,598
of saying things which are not proper.

460
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,924
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

461
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,065
but consciously if you work it out

462
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:46,461
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

463
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:49,475
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

464
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:53,574
anything, can you believe it?

465
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:58,097
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

466
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:02,290
anything against the Holy Spirit.

467
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,661
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

468
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:11,640
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

469
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,098
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

470
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:18,467
and how far to go, how far to understand

471
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,394
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:27,369
So today we have a great day

473
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:35,140
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

474
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:39,366
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

475
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,836
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

476
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,037
About the times and timings,

477
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:48,073
one should know that Mother knows best,

478
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:51,861
and everything works out with the timing properly.

479
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:57,515
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

480
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:02,388
and all the timings work out in that way.

481
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:06,171
So everything has to work in the way,

482
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,796
actually the timings are of the moon,

483
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:11,572
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

484
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,654
what time this works out, this thing, that.

485
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:16,264
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

486
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:20,911
work out according to My understanding.

487
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:25,800
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

488
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:29,126
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

489
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,495
 Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

490
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:34,491
And if your ego is there or anything,

491
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:38,254
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

492
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,598
All right?

493
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:45,669
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

494
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,538
as Modi will be doing,

495
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:51,899
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

496
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,115
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

497
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,816
[Hindi]

498
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:09,070
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

499
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:13,267
Let all the children come for the puja.
