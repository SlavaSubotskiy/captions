1
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,583
Today we are celebrating in Switzerland

2
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:29,458
the coronation of Shri Rama on Dassera Day.

3
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:34,500
Many things happened on Dassera Day.

4
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,500
The most important was

5
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:42,625
that Shri Rama was “coronated”

6
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,625
as a king on this day.

7
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:58,125
He also killed Ravana on this day.

8
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,875
Many may say that “how can it be He killed Ravana

9
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,583
and He was “coronated” on the same date?”

10
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:13,542
In those days in India, we had supersonic aeroplanes

11
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:19,792
and - is a fact, and the aeroplane’s name was Pushpak,

12
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,208
meaning “the flower”.

13
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:26,583
It was called as Pushpak and it has a tremendous speed.

14
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with His wife

15
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,917
and that was the day He was crowned.

16
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:45,959
On the ninth day, He worshiped the Goddess to get strength,

17
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,500
Shakti, for his weapons,

18
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:53,999
and the tenth day He killed Ravana.

19
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,333
So, you can imagine how much advanced people were there

20
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:02,333
at the time of Shri Rama and His kingdom.

21
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:07,291
The reason was the king was an incarnation;

22
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:14,000
also He was a benevolent king as described by Socrates.

23
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:20,375
Shri Rama’s story is very interesting throughout

24
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:25,417
and we have now a beautiful series about Him

25
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:32,667
done by our television in India, which is sold for a very good price,

26
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:39,250
maybe we might be able to present you all with one, when you come there.

27
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:46,792
But the story of Rama they say was written before He was born.

28
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:55,208
Even before there was any inkling of it.

29
00:06:55,792 --> 00:07:02,041
The seer, Valmiki, wrote the whole story of Shri Rama.

30
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,291
Shri Rama’s birth and all that

31
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:13,458
are brought forth by the Agni, the fire,

32
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:21,667
and He was born in the Dynasty of the Surya, is the sun.

33
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,542
So with all that,

34
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,250
born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire,

35
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:38,458
and also was born in the dynasty of Surya,

36
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:46,166
He was one of the mildest avataras you have ever had.

37
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:51,917
He’s known to be a very

38
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,166
I mean English language

39
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,667
formal person, in the sense

40
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:08,750
sankoch - that He would go to any extent

41
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:16,875
to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something.

42
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,417
We still had many people in India like that.

43
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,667
Like we had one prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri,

44
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,959
and

45
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,250
if he was sitting in the room and there are people sitting

46
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,125
and there’s electricity was on somehow,

47
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
say by light or something, and he wants to put it off,

48
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,917
he would not ask anyone to put it off.

49
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,333
Slowly he’ll get up from his seat,

50
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,083
walk up to the switch and just put it off

51
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,000
so that he shouldn’t ask for anything.

52
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,000
This is one of the greatest quality of Shri Rama

53
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,291
that He would not make anyone do anything for Him

54
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,999
or order anything or would use someone for that purpose.

55
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:14,875
See, He was the blessing of fire

56
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,667
and born in the Surya.

57
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:22,500
But what we find, those people who are born,

58
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,625
maybe in very lowly families,

59
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:30,542
in the negative families, the left-sided as you can call it,

60
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,999
with all kinds of problems,

61
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:39,834
have a terrible Agnya and a terrible Suryada.

62
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:46,542
The person who is born in the Surya has to be extremely humble.

63
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,417
He is the one who shows that nothing can affect him,

64
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:58,500
nothing can make him feel that he is something great.

65
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:03,291
Now, when we see His life further,

66
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,166
He was a very humble man.

67
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:13,000
We've seen now people who try to despise others,

68
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,333
“I don’t like you”, “I don’t like”,

69
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,875
“It’s not good”, “It’s very difficult”,

70
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:26,834
is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character,

71
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,500
has no character at all but is low in character.

72
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,500
Anybody who has any character is shown

73
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,208
by the tolerance he has of other people.

74
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:48,208
Intolerance is a sign of a person who is extremely egoistical

75
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:53,542
and has,  is vain, there’s vanity.

76
00:10:54,041 --> 00:11:01,500
Shri Rama was so much loved by the people where He ruled in that state

77
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,959
and He had the most beautiful wife

78
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:11,750
of the most venerated father, Janaka,

79
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,709
and who was the beloved son of His father.

80
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:21,166
But He was such an humble man, such an humble man,

81
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,333
that in all His character you see the beauty.

82
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:30,625
Like, He was going by a little boat

83
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:35,250
when He went for His exile.

84
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,999
And the one who was taking Him was an ordinary boatman.

85
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,208
And the boatman was feeling very much upset

86
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:49,417
that he’s sitting before the king of Ayodhya

87
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,041
and he doesn’t have proper clothes.

88
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:58,125
So Shri Rama, who was Himself was wearing nothing but

89
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:04,333
valkalas - are the clothes which are worn by the village people

90
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:09,500
or worn by the people who live in the primitive areas,

91
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,000
only kind of leaves that they have.

92
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,709
He had to wear that because His mother, the stepmother,

93
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:22,792
asked for that kind of boon from the father.

94
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:27,333
And then Shri Rama just told him,

95
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,834
“Why are you worried? I am wearing this. I am no more a king.

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,917
I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted.

97
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:40,166
And I really don’t know how to steer the boat

98
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:44,333
while you know how to steer the boat so why should you be worried?”

99
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:49,041
Like that He kept even the people

100
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,875
who we would call as low in society

101
00:12:54,041 --> 00:13:00,875
at a very high pedestal, which shows that He respected human beings.

102
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,709
He Himself is called as Mariada Purushottama,

103
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,083
means He was the one who had to knew

104
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,959
how far to go with someone, Mariadas

105
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,709
How to talk to someone, how to approach someone,

106
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:21,083
while we find people who misbehave,

107
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,083
even with their husbands, with their wives, with their children,

108
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:30,792
with everyone and also outside they are about to jump on others.

109
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,041
That’s absolutely against Rama.  It’s like Ravana.

110
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,458
Even Ravana was not like this.

111
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,999
He was also of not that nature

112
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,792
because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realized soul

113
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:51,625
but he had become a rakshasa because he became arrogant,

114
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,667
but even his arrogance cannot be matched

115
00:13:54,875 --> 00:14:00,333
with many modern people and modern girls and men that I hear and see,

116
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,375
that it is surprising they have really surpassed Ravana.

117
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,166
Ravana only had ten heads but sometimes I feel

118
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:12,166
that the modern men might have, or the women specially,

119
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:17,041
might have hundred and eight heads.

120
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:25,083
The arrogance, the amount of expression of hatred,

121
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:30,709
is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless,

122
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,667
but I see such people very common

123
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,709
and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow.

124
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:48,083
Actually, such people are absolutely despised by God Almighty.

125
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,999
You go further with His life, see He went

126
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:58,625
and into the village where a very old woman

127
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,333
who was belonging to the primitive class of beings,

128
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:08,999
had very few teeth, and she brought some

129
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,875
some fruits, little fruits we call as ber,

130
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,417
and she brought and gave it to Him,

131
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:21,083
that “Shri Ram, you see, I have got these for you.

132
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,250
I don’t have anything else. And these, I’ve tested all of them.”

133
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,583
Actually in India, if you put in the mouth it is utishta,

134
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,875
nobody will touch it.

135
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,792
But she says, “I have tasted all of them by piercing my teeth into it

136
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,667
and I have seen that none of them are sour.”

137
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:42,333
Shri Rama didn’t like sour fruits, she knew,

138
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:46,041
so, “None of them are sour and you can have them.”

139
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,166
I mean, in a way, if it is done to somebody in the west

140
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,083
they will hit you hard.

141
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,041
Immediately Shri Rama rushed forward

142
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:02,834
and took the bers from her hand,

143
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,542
kissed her hand, said, "All right, all right, I’m going to have them.”

144
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,750
With such enthusiasm He ate them.

145
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,999
So Lakshmana was little angry at that lady, “What’s this going on?”

146
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,000
So Sitaji said, “Oh do you like them very much?”

147
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,250
He said, “Yes, but I’m not going to give you anything.”

148
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,917
She said, “No, I am your half body. You have to give me.”

149
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,291
So He gave some to Sitaji. So Sitaji ate,

150
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,166
“Yaah, what a thing! It’s like nectar of heaven I am eating.”

151
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,500
So Lakshmana felt very jealous.

152
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,166
He said, “Sister-in-law, can I not have a little of it?”

153
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,959
She said, “No. I can’t give you. You ask your brother.

154
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,166
I’m not going to give you. I have a very little share.

155
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,500
Why don’t you ask your brother?”

156
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:56,250
So he goes to his brother, he says, “Can I have some more?”

157
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:03,875
So Shri Rama smiled and gave him that ber which was eaten,

158
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:09,125
or touched, or was pierced, by the teeth of a primitive woman,

159
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,959
who is actually an outcast according to the Brahminic laws of India.

160
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,959
The sweetness of Shri Rama,

161
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,999
the way He used to make people feel comfortable,

162
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:34,667
like I would say, an example of a oyster

163
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:41,875
who gets a little stone into the body of the shell,

164
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:48,500
takes out a kind of a shiny liquid

165
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,959
and covers it with that shiny liquid

166
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:56,959
and makes it into a pearl to be comfortable.

167
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,041
Now, He didn’t want His own comfort.

168
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,375
Rama is a little bit different

169
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:12,792
that He wanted to make everyone into a diamond, or a pearl,

170
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,999
so that the other person would shine and would look nice,

171
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,250
and that’s how He felt comforted.

172
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:28,834
His qualities, if you have to imbibe, first of all

173
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:34,875
we have to understand the innate situation of Shri Rama.

174
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:42,375
Shri Rama is placed on the right hand side of your heart,

175
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,999
right hand side, right heart.  He’s placed there.

176
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,166
Now in a human being there is no right heart.

177
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,959
If you tell somebody there's right heart, they’ll say, “What,

178
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,875
there are two hearts, or three hearts?”

179
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:04,417
In our Sahaja Yoga we have three hearts:

180
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:09,709
one is the left, another is the right, and one is the center.

181
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:14,667
Now the right heart is a very important thing.

182
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:22,041
The right heart looks after the whole

183
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,625
lungs, both the lungs,

184
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,542
all the throat,

185
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,750
the trachea, the nose, the inner part.

186
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,125
The outer side is looked after, we can say,

187
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,875
the features are given by Shri Krishna

188
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,834
but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama.

189
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:50,792
They are the same, but one acts as an inner part,

190
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,542
another as the outer part.

191
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,333
It gives you the ears, from the inner part, Shri Rama does.

192
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:04,625
He gives you the eyes, in the inner part of the eyes.

193
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:09,750
Now, it’s so important to have the inner side all right

194
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:14,375
than the outer side. Is an example of Shri Rama,

195
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:21,083
He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person.

196
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,709
Because He came before Shri Krishna,

197
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:29,999
He tried to build up the inner side of a human being.

198
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,083
So we can say, though He is on the right heart,

199
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,083
He acts through your Hamsa Chakra

200
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:41,083
and partly through your Vishuddhi Chakra in the inner side of it.

201
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,583
Because Shri Krishna, in the inner side of it is Shri Rama,

202
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,083
is Shri Vishnu.

203
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:53,166
So, when somebody is,

204
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,834
say, not good looking according to the western standard,

205
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:02,625
according to Me the western standards are rather funny,

206
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,291
because western standards don’t look like

207
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,083
neither like Krishna or Shri Rama.

208
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:19,667
The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy, tall person

209
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,917
with his hands up to the knees,

210
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,875
ajanabav, means the one who has ajanabav,

211
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:34,166
and He was plump, both of them were plump.

212
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,083
They had to be plump people, because they were

213
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,583
though they were born of the Agni, He was born of the Agni,

214
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:48,333
but the water is the main element of Shri Vishnu.

215
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,875
So they were all plump people.

216
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,834
They were not thin like sticks as today’s modern ideas are,

217
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,999
to be thin like sticks and like TB-patients.

218
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:04,041
But it doesn’t mean all plump people are good.

219
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,458
We always logically think that plump people are,

220
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,375
if  Mother says so, then plump people are good. Is not the point.

221
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,166
The inner side of it I am saying.

222
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,417
The inner side of it is just the opposite.

223
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:22,250
Inner side of it is absolutely beautiful

224
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:29,166
and absolutely full of love, affection and warmth.

225
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,959
A person who doesn’t have these things,

226
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:38,125
is a sign of a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, first of all.

227
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,375
A person who is very loud,

228
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:46,750
talks loudly, speaks loudly, laughs at wrong places

229
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,999
must be half mad but cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

230
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:56,875
See this softness of Shri Rama goes to the extremes

231
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,125
where I call the sankocha, the formality, the formal

232
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,959
but it is English language, “formal” is not the word, sankoch.

233
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,667
He was once

234
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,792
when He was fighting Ravana,

235
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:21,834
He was taking out with His arrow his ten heads one after another.

236
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,917
And if He took out one then took out the second,

237
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:30,542
the first one would come back so because he had a kind of a blessing

238
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,583
that nobody can kill him by hitting him on his head.

239
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,375
So Lakshmana says, “You know for definite

240
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:43,500
that this Ravana cannot be killed by hitting on his head,

241
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,834
so why don’t You hit him in his heart?”

242
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,667
So He said, “The reason is this,

243
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:56,750
that just now in his heart is Mahalakshmi, the Sita.

244
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:01,834
Sita is sitting in his heart. And how can I hit him on his heart ?

245
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,333
Because She’s there,  She might be hurt.”

246
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,500
“So what’s the use of hitting on the head?” he said.

247
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,792
He said, “Because, once I start hitting him on the head fast,

248
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,333
his attention will go there.

249
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,125
As soon as his attention will go into his head

250
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,166
then I can hit him on his heart.”

251
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,959
See the sankoch?

252
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,333
See the sankoch, the way He talked.

253
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,375
Now we have - Tina, what is wrong with you?

254
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:39,166
Why are you all the time smiling like this. Can't you keep quiet?

255
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,375
What is there to smile, about certain things,

256
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:46,417
where you don't have to smile?  Keep quiet!

257
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,709
Now, then what happened, that He was

258
00:24:55,667 --> 00:25:00,417
so kind once when a very ugly woman, Shurpanaka,

259
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:05,750
came to entice Him. And she said, she came to entice,

260
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:09,458
she said that, “Rama why don’t You marry me?”

261
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:13,166
I mean, to a person like Rama who is Mariada Purushottama

262
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,291
to ask such a horrible questions.

263
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,625
Somebody would have really beaten her up if not anything else.

264
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:25,417
So, Shri Ram smiled. He said,

265
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,333
“Madam, I’m sorry.

266
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:34,125
I have a wife and I believe in one wife, aika patni vrat.

267
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,417
So I’m sorry I can’t marry you.”

268
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,917
But mischievously He says, “All right, My brother is there.

269
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:44,625
His wife is left in Ayodhya. You can ask.”

270
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:50,625
So he went to her and he asked,

271
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:57,750
She went to him and asked, “Lakshmana why don’t you marry me? ”

272
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,291
She had become very beautiful.

273
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,333
She has transformed herself to a beautiful woman.

274
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:05,291
She must have gone to some beauty parlor or something,

275
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,875
but she made herself like that, and she was there.

276
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:13,917
And he looked at her so angry, he said, “You, the ugly,

277
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:17,667
why do you want to ask such a question?”  He cut her nose.

278
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:20,000
When he cut her nose, that was in Nasik

279
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,500
and that’s why Nasika means the nose,

280
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,500
and that’s why you have been to Nasik,

281
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,999
that’s the place where he cut her nose.

282
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,917
He was very angry.  But Shri Rama did not.

283
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,250
He said in a way that’s very convincing that,

284
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:38,208
“See I have a wife and I am a person who believes in My one wife.”

285
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:42,625
Now the another character about Him was that He was consistent.

286
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,000
He was never inconsistent like Shri Krishna.

287
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:54,750
Shri Krishna was a diplomat and diplomacy is in being inconsistent.

288
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,999
Shri Krishna’s style was different. But ….

289
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:05,375
Why?  What is the matter with you?  Why, what is it?

290
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,583
You come ad sit here. This side come along Tina.

291
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,542
Come and sit on the other side. Why do you talk to her?

292
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,208
Go and sit at the back. Go.

293
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:22,166
She has already given me a very bad time in Pune, and now here she is.

294
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,875
While I am talking, please don't talk to each other.

295
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,709
This is the least you can do to me.

296
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:32,333
Have you seen any Indians behave like this?

297
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:45,917
It's very disturbing.

298
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,875
I am concentrating on you why you are not concentrating on me.

299
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,875
It's alright, when there is a joke, something - you laugh.

300
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:58,083
What's the need to talk to each other, I can`t understand.

301
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:05,458
Alright. Sorry I had to say that.

302
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,208
You see at the time, when I am discussing Shri Rama.

303
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:13,125
Shri Rama would not have said that.

304
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,500
But in Sahaja Yoga, you can’t carry on like Shri Rama.

305
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,999
Sometimes you have to be like Parashurama also,

306
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:25,333
otherwise things don’t work out.

307
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:30,917
Now, when it went ahead with it

308
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,041
in His character, which was so beautiful,

309
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,583
that you find He was such a consistent person.

310
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:44,250
Whatever He said, all the life He carried that. For example, He said,

311
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:49,166
“I am the one who believes in one wife, aika patni vrat.”

312
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:57,291
Now He had a very nice wife, no doubt, very beautiful wife,

313
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,417
but She had gone to Ravana and He was left alone.

314
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,834
When they wanted to start a kind of a yagya

315
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,999
called as Rajasurya yagya

316
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:15,083
which was meant to be  the conquering the whole world.

317
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,083
Then they asked Him,

318
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:21,041
“You have to marry, because you have to have your wife.”

319
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:26,500
He said, “No, I can’t marry, because nobody could be like My wife

320
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:31,583
and I can’t marry. I can forego this kind of a yagya,

321
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,458
but I can’t marry again.”

322
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:38,625
So, then they said, “All right, there’s only one thing you can do

323
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:42,959
is to make a statue of Sita in gold

324
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:50,125
and you have to use Her, that statue, as a wife representing.”

325
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,917
He said, “That I will agree.” He took away all His ornaments,

326
00:29:55,083 --> 00:30:01,417
everything, and made that statue and He did this yagya.

327
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,959
So whatever He said He followed thoroughly.

328
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:08,375
In His dharma He was perfect.

329
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,417
Another incident is that when

330
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:17,250
Sita was lost.

331
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:22,999
He never slept, He never slept on a bed,

332
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,834
always on the Mother Earth.

333
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,417
Never slept on a bed, always on the Mother Earth.

334
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,709
The pain He had of His wife

335
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:36,750
is very well described by all the poets of India.

336
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:41,667
And when Sita left Him ultimately in a very mysterious way,

337
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:44,709
She just disappeared in the Mother Earth

338
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,834
because Mother Earth had given Her birth

339
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,999
so She disappeared into Mother Earth.

340
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:54,458
Then Shri Rama became absolutely lost

341
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,917
and He jumped in the river Sarayu

342
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:03,458
and disappeared in the water element from where He had come.

343
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:08,291
Now this man had to give up His wife.

344
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
In this contrast you can see

345
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:15,667
the wave rising and falling of a personality.

346
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,333
The society in which He lived, the state which He ruled,

347
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:25,834
had an objection for a wife, who had lived with Ravana.

348
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,500
And the public started talking about it.

349
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:33,458
So, as a good king, He just, as a good king,

350
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:40,667
He just decided that His wife should be left forever.

351
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:50,083
And then He sent Her on a beautiful chariot

352
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:55,041
with His prime minister

353
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,500
and His brother, Lakshmana,

354
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,083
who took Her down and left Her, told Her,

355
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:06,834
this is what has happened and that Shri Rama has asked us

356
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:11,792
to take you down to the ashram of Valmiki.

357
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,208
As a result of that She got very upset and She said,

358
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,291
She was Adi Shakti, so She doesn’t have to bother.

359
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,750
She said, “You just leave Me here.”

360
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,917
Very self-respecting person.

361
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,959
She didn’t say, “No, no, no, no, I’ll come to Him”

362
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:36,667
or “I’ll sue Him. I’ll go in the courts, get all His money.

363
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:41,959
How dare He throw me out.”  Nothing of the kind.

364
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:49,083
That’s the grace of a woman. Graciously She said, “All right,

365
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,500
now you have listened to your brother.

366
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,709
I’m your sister-in-law, elder too. Now you obey Me.

367
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:59,250
And I tell you, as your sister-in-law, that you can now go.

368
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:04,917
Leave Me here alone and I don’t want you to go any further with Me

369
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:10,417
to deport Me with somebody. ” And She was pregnant.

370
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,542
Here if it happens, of course horrible things can happen,

371
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,125
but in India if such a thing happens, the wife will kill herself

372
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,333
or she won’t be able to bear it.

373
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,625
I think both things are just the same, an escape.

374
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,583
If there’s no aggression then there is recession.

375
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:33,250
But She said, “No. I have to give birth to these two children.

376
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,417
I can look after Myself, all right. Graciously He’s done it,

377
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:41,083
I am nothing and please tell Him not to worry about Me.”

378
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,166
And She told Shri Rama, Shri Lakshmana that,

379
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:47,208
“All right, you look after Him, that’s all I want.”

380
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:51,125
And She told the chief minister, the mantri,

381
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:55,792
that “You must look after the kingdom.”

382
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,291
See the dignity, see the balance,

383
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,917
see the character, the personality of Shri Rama.

384
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,959
He was called as Mariada Purushottama. And look at His wife.

385
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,709
She was equal to Him in every way.

386
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:20,208
When She was kept by Ravana,

387
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:27,083
Ravana was so frightened of Her Shakti that he would not touch Her.

388
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:31,291
He used to frighten Her, say “I’ll do this to the women of India.

389
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,125
I’ll do this to the women of the world.

390
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,542
I’ll do that kind of a horrible thing.

391
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,667
I’ll take another birth. I’ll misbehave.”

392
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,542
She said, “Do what you like. You cannot touch Me.”

393
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:48,125
He could not touch Her hand, he was so frightened.

394
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:54,875
And when Hanumana brought the ring of Shri Rama

395
00:34:55,041 --> 00:35:02,291
and presented to Her and said that, “This is the ring of Shri Rama.”

396
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,041
She said, “Yes, I know. How is He?” He said, “All right.”

397
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,291
All enquiries She had about Herself. So He said,

398
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,834
“Mother, I can take You on my back.

399
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,542
I can easily take You. You come on My back and I’ll take You.”

400
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,875
She said, “No. I won’t go with You. It's my ..

401
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:28,083
It’s Shri Rama who is a brave king,

402
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:35,333
He should come Himself, fight this Ravana, kill him because he’s evil,

403
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:40,250
and then I will go with Him with all the glory.”

404
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:43,125
She was not frightened of anything.

405
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:47,583
For Her, the important thing was that Ravana should be killed.

406
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:53,417
He’s evil and he should be killed by Rama.

407
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,875
Such a great courage for a woman.

408
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:01,667
Both sides if you see you’ll be surprised that how

409
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:07,542
a woman’s character is such a powerful thing.

410
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,500
It’s not a reactionary thing,

411
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,500
“My husband is like this, that’s why I’m like that.”

412
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,458
or “My husband doesn’t do this for me, that’s why I’m like that.

413
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,667
My husband is gone away so I’m finished.

414
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,125
What am I to do without my husband? ” Nothing of the kind.

415
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,999
She stands on Her feet.

416
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,208
She said “No,” to Hanumana

417
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,458
and She stands on Her feet

418
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:34,917
and She says, “When Rama will come and kill this evil

419
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,625
and remove this evil from this earth,

420
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:43,000
then only He can take Me with Him. I won’t go with You.

421
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,750
I won’t escape. I won’t run away.

422
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,500
Nothing.  I am going to face it Myself here.”

423
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,375
For a woman it is too much to say,

424
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:57,500
to be imprisoned in a horrible person’s jail

425
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,667
or in a place which is so dangerous for Her,

426
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,709
to say that “I won’t go. Whatever you may try,

427
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,834
whatever tricks you may try, whatever you may say.

428
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,458
I won’t go.”

429
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,917
Just imagine.

430
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,125
And Ravana was such a horrid fellow.

431
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:22,667
He did all kinds of things to Her

432
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:28,834
but She kept absolutely calm and quiet,

433
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,625
waiting for Her husband to come back.

434
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:38,291
Can we think of such women in modern times?

435
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,083
So satisfied with themselves, so much in balance,

436
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:54,208
so much full of confidence and strength.

437
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,458
This is the message of Sita’s life.

438
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,500
The benevolence of Shri Rama was shown

439
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:08,083
when He started ruling the people.

440
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:15,041
He was the one who cared for the needs of the people.

441
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:21,959
For Him, it was important that the people whom He ruled

442
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,250
should be happy and joyous.

443
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,959
He looked after them with great love.

444
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:32,291
He had two sons

445
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:37,999
whom He looked after for a short time

446
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:43,375
because they were lost with the mother, Sita,

447
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:48,667
and they are the ones who found Him out in a way

448
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:54,125
that Valmiki taught them how to sing the Ramayana.

449
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:59,125
And they went to Ayodhya and sang the Ramayana.

450
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:02,667
Rama went with them.

451
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:06,333
And one day in one of the yagyas,

452
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:10,166
when they caught the horse of Shri Rama,

453
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:16,041
Hanumana found it impossible to fight those two boys

454
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,250
and He couldn’t understand.

455
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:23,250
Here now, the character of great Hanumana One has to describe.

456
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:27,417
He went and told Shri Rama, “I can’t understand, these two boys,

457
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:32,291
I can’t face them. I don’t know who they are.”

458
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:36,125
So, Shri Rama went there.

459
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,291
And these boys were standing with their arrows.

460
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:44,041
Then Shri Sita appeared before them and She said,

461
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,875
“You cannot fight. He is your father.”

462
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:52,709
This made Hanumana realize it. And He said, “All right,

463
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:57,792
I can fight Shri Rama now. Why did He leave you like this?”

464
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:04,750
See the sweetness of Shri Hanumana who was such a great devotee,

465
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,709
such a great devotee of Shri Rama,

466
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:12,000
could see that, “He has done injustice to My Mother”

467
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,250
and He stood for that.

468
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,625
Is very sweet of Shri Hanumana to do that.

469
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:25,291
Hanumana is, as you know, is the angel Gabriel

470
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,875
who is innocence, simplicity, and dynamism.

471
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:36,709
His dynamism was such that as soon as He was born,

472
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,000
He said, “Better eat this sun

473
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:44,875
because the sun is scorching the people in India.”

474
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,999
So He went and gulped down the sun.

475
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:51,875
People had to say that, “You see, though too the sun is scorching

476
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:56,875
but it’s of great help. Please release the sun. Why did you eat it off?”

477
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,667
So then He released the sun.

478
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:04,917
Hanumana’s whole life was spent in serving Shri Rama.

479
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:11,999
And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Shri Ram.

480
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:17,333
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumana had navadha,

481
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:23,709
navadha siddhis, navadha siddhis, nine siddhis,

482
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,125
anima, ganima, raguma, and all sorts of things,

483
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,166
that He could become small, He could become big, he could ...

484
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,333
so many things He had.

485
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:37,792
Despite all these siddhis and the amount of power He had,

486
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:40,917
that Shri Rama once asked Him that,

487
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:46,625
“My brother, Lakshmana, is being hit

488
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,834
and he’s very sick. I mean, he’s just dying.

489
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,083
So you go and get a particular kind of a sanjeevani,

490
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:59,041
a kind of a herb, which I want to rub on his head.”

491
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:02,750
So He went there and He found and he couldn’t find it

492
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:07,542
so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and gave it to Rama,

493
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,999
"Now You select, I don’t know. I can’t find it.”

494
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,834
That is the Hanumana Shakti.

495
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:18,750
And with all that power, He was such a humble person

496
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:22,125
and such a dedicated person.

497
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,208
This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi.

498
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,999
Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and non-violent.

499
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,333
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that,

500
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:42,000
“What is the non-violence of the weak?”

501
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,750
A weak has to be non-violent, what’s so great?

502
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:52,667
But that’s a policy or a kind of a protection that he has.

503
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:56,792
So a weak person has to be non-violent

504
00:42:56,999 --> 00:43:02,750
because he cannot face, he cannot protest.

505
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:10,999
But non-violence of the powerful is the sign of real non-violence.

506
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:17,208
Those who are powerful, if they are non-violent,

507
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:22,208
that means they are quite confident of their powers.

508
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,917
Those people who are confident of their powers,

509
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,291
why should they aggress others?

510
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,834
They just stand, “All right, come along, what do you want?”

511
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,041
Even saying that, people run away.

512
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:39,458
So those who are violent, angry, hot tempered,

513
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:44,250
jump at everyone, torture everyone, trouble everyone,

514
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,458
are the people who are very weak charactered.

515
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,333
Their character is weak.

516
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,333
If their character was all right

517
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:57,875
then they would not have done all these things.

518
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:04,208
That’s the sign of a person who is either possessed

519
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:08,125
and under the influence of the possession - he’s doing that;

520
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:12,083
or he’s too weak and he’s possessed by his anger

521
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:18,166
because he doesn’t have that much power to bear anything.

522
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,375
The most powerful thing is the Mother Earth

523
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,667
because she has a power to bear.

524
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:28,208
The one who has the power to bear, is the powerful.

525
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,750
The one who does not have any power to bear,

526
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:34,458
“I can’t bear. I don’t like. I this...”

527
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:39,083
Such a person is a useless thing for this earth and sometimes I feel,

528
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:42,375
“Why God created them?”

529
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:45,792
It’s a headache to have a person round you,

530
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:48,583
“I can’t eat this. I don’t like this.”

531
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:52,834
Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either.

532
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,333
No one likes such a person and that’s why that person is always,

533
00:44:57,542 --> 00:45:01,583
“I don’t like this. I don’t like that. I …”

534
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:10,000
So the power of a person lies in bearing things.

535
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:16,792
How much you can bear, how much you can undergo without feeling it?

536
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,458
Like, you are say, in the jungle, you are happy.

537
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:23,041
If you are in a palace you are happy.

538
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,999
If you are with the this color or that color,

539
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,792
if you are with this race or that race,

540
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:35,999
if you are with this kind of life or that kind of life,

541
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,083
you can bear it.

542
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:43,834
And that bearing power gives you the caliber,

543
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:49,500
the caliber to have Sahaja Yoga.

544
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:56,792
It’s not that this is shown, it’s not that is being suffered,

545
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:04,542
don’t have to say, “I suffer being like this.” No, you don’t suffer.

546
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,792
It’s just by the way.

547
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,333
For a person who wants all the comforts,

548
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:18,625
a person who wants to live with all the luxuries,

549
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:25,458
but not with any kind of defects or any deficiencies,

550
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,750
is a person is a beggar, I would say, in every sense of the word.

551
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:38,250
I mean, best things to get rid of problems is

552
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,959
not to have them. In the sense:

553
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:44,917
now I don’t drive so I have no problem of driving.

554
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:50,500
I don’t have - I never telephone, so I don’t have problems of telephones.

555
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:56,125
I don’t go to the banks, so I don’t have problems of the banks.

556
00:46:56,333 --> 00:47:01,709
The best is: I don’t have any income so I have no problem of income tax.

557
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,208
Whatever bothers you, you just don’t have it.

558
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:11,625
Why do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it?

559
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:15,667
It seems very funny that you can get rid of anything

560
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,709
that bothers you very easily in this world.

561
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:22,709
So you need not have that kind of a thing on your head.

562
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:27,625
But when the word ‘problem’, specially in the European community

563
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:30,125
‘problem’ is a very common word,

564
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:34,291
but in English language we never learnt this word ‘problem’.

565
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:41,625
You see only the ‘problem’ was used when we were studying geometry,

566
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,250
geometrical problem, but we never knew there’s a problem in life.

567
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,917
Later on when I came in contact with European community,

568
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:54,417
they’ll say, “There’s no problem." "This is the problem.”

569
00:47:54,709 --> 00:48:00,291
At least in one day hundred times they say ‘problem’ word.

570
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:04,667
So, for a problem the solution is

571
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:08,709
not to have that thing which gives you problem.

572
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:11,125
You can give up anything.

573
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,875
Anything that you want, you can give up if you know

574
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:17,500
how to detach yourself from that.

575
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:21,834
Many people come and tell Me, “Mother we have an ego.

576
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:26,542
That’s the problem.”  I said, “Then give up.”

577
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:30,834
I mean, is simple, why do you have it?

578
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,834
As if, you see, they want to say that, we

579
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:39,375
“We have trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on to it.

580
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,709
Like we are afraid of a crocodile

581
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:48,083
but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile.

582
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:53,625
And we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by the crocodile.”

583
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:57,458
Now give up.  But they will search out a crocodile,

584
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:02,291
open the mouth, and put the foot in it and then come to Me and say,

585
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,583
“Mother we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile.”

586
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:12,959
To get to problems you have to get to it.

587
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:20,999
But without getting to it, how will you get a problem?

588
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:28,250
Say, for example, people have very silly, stupid problems. Now.

589
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,875
The first problem somebody may have,

590
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:35,208
“Oh I have to get my clothes pressed.”

591
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:40,709
What’s the need? No problem. Wear them as they are. Who looks at it?

592
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,250
“You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes.”

593
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:46,792
Doesn’t matter what is there. If it is not pressed, such a, such a ...

594
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:50,875
It’s a problem for them. It’s silly things like that,

595
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,542
you’ll see very silly things.

596
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,083
But the greatest problem I think you have is your watch.

597
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,333
In Switzerland, I shouldn’t say so.

598
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:11,792
You see the problem is like this, that now you have to go the airport.

599
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,250
As soon as you tell somebody we have to go to the airport,

600
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:22,875
now, I have to go, you don’t have to, everybody gets sort of a jumping

601
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:26,375
as if standing on a jumping board. You see all of them jumping like that.

602
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:29,250
“What’s the matter?” “Mother you have to go to the airport.”

603
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:34,667
“So, it’s all right. I have to go. What’s, what's wrong with you?”

604
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:37,166
“Is a problem. ” I say, “What’s the problem?

605
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:41,083
I have to go. You just know that you don’t have to go at all

606
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,458
and don’t have to come to the airport.

607
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:46,959
And the aeroplane, if it comes and doesn’t take Me,

608
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,208
I’m not going to come back on your heads

609
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:52,417
so I’ll stay in a hotel. Don’t you worry.”

610
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,500
But why are you so excited about it?

611
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:58,125
The way people are excited that I must catch the plane,

612
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:02,375
sometimes I feel as if they want to get rid of Me.

613
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:10,417
So, this is a problem for people who are very meticulous.

614
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:15,041
Now, supposing I say, “I know that the plane won’t leave Me.”

615
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:19,125
I know, because I know many things so I have no problems,

616
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:24,291
but supposing even if you think the plane you may not get,

617
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:28,542
so it may not get.  But if it gets you, all right.

618
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,625
If it doesn’t get you, it’s all right. So where is the problem?

619
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:37,999
Either it will take you or it will not take you. What is in between?

620
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:41,750
Where is the problem, I still don’t understand.

621
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,917
Either it will work out or it will not work out.

622
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,709
Keep two possibilities. That’s the only two possibilities.

623
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:53,417
What is the third possibility that gives you the problem? You tell Me.

624
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,417
Say somebody owes Me money, all right,

625
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:00,500
so either he will give Me or he may not give Me.

626
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:06,041
What is the problem?  The problem is that you call it a problem

627
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:11,583
and want to avoid to face the truth.

628
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,999
If you face the truth, you will know one thing

629
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:18,333
that see now this man has to give me money. All right,

630
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:19,999
I’ll go and face it.

631
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:23,125
I’ll tell him, “Sir, you have to give me the money.

632
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:28,583
You have to pay me. This is your duty

633
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:31,500
and if you don’t pay me, you are doing wrong.”

634
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,000
You get at him and face him and tell him.

635
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,500
But you won’t do that. You’ll sit at home, “Oh God, it’s a problem.

636
00:52:38,709 --> 00:52:40,999
I have to, you see, that man is not giving money.

637
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,041
Oh God. That’s a problem.”

638
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,250
Sitting here, hitting your head all the time, how will you get it?

639
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:55,250
If you face it directly then you’ll be amazed,

640
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:58,875
there’s no problem for anything.

641
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,625
Say your car fails. So it fails,

642
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:07,917
get down, enjoy your self nicely till somebody comes along, takes you.

643
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,917
Or, if supposing you don’t get some lift, all right,

644
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:15,792
stay there overnight. What is it? No tiger is going to eat you.

645
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,250
And if the tiger has to eat you, it will eat.

646
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:28,000
Where is the problem?  Still I can’t see.

647
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,834
I can’t see the problem.  If tiger has to eat,

648
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,166
that’s already destined that the tiger has to eat.

649
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:41,875
In any case, nobody dies. You’ll be born again.

650
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:47,625
If you look at it from that angle

651
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:51,333
then you’ll be surprised, most of the problems do not exist.

652
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:55,625
They are like bubbles created by our own thinking,

653
00:53:55,834 --> 00:54:00,750
the waves of our thinking, “This is the problem. That is the problem.”

654
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,709
Like today, they said there is no hall on such and such date.

655
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:06,250
All right. “Where are you having the hall? ” “There.”

656
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:09,709
“If there’s no hall, let us have it in the open.”

657
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:19,125
So to make the best of it is, is the way Shri Rama shows you.

658
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:23,750
Now, what is the way He has helped us, let us see.

659
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Shri Rama by His character, by His balance, His peace

660
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:34,166
and His mildness and His sweetness has shown us

661
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,583
how a king should be a benevolent king

662
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:39,999
and at the same time a very loving husband

663
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,208
and a loving father and a person in dharma,

664
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:48,999
but apart from that, He went down to Maharashtra.

665
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,250
He arranged all these things

666
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:56,458
so that He could walk down to Maharashtra bare feet to vibrate the land

667
00:54:56,667 --> 00:55:00,000
because Sahaja Yogis will be going one day to Maharashtra

668
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:03,458
and the Maharashtra has to be a vibrated land.

669
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:09,208
In Ayodhya, He never took out His shoes because He was the king there.

670
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:12,458
But when He went, and Shri Sita, both of them,

671
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:16,709
when they went to Maharashtra They took out their shoes to vibrate it.

672
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:20,875
On His way, He saw a big stone

673
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:25,959
which was nothing but a lady cursed to be a stone, Ahilya.

674
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:30,750
And He made her, just by touch, she again came back to life.

675
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:36,417
Like that, one after another He was just, by the way, as if was doing,

676
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,583
but that was the purpose of His life to go there.

677
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:48,709
And that has helped a very great achievement within ourselves,

678
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,125
is the Shri Ram.

679
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:54,208
Shri Rama stands for the pranavai,

680
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:59,959
is for the vital air that we take in.

681
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:05,125
For the vital air, and that vital air when it gets heated up,

682
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:09,834
we have to know that we are not any more with Shri Ram.

683
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:14,083
It has to be the cool air to blow through your nose  and your mouth.

684
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:18,333
I don’t know about you people, it happens with Me all the time.

685
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,083
When you are angry the nostrils go up, swell up,

686
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:27,375
and the hot air, the hot words, and everything hot,

687
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:31,041
the heated eyes, and everything goes up like that, curled up,

688
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,333
and you become ferocious Ravana.

689
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:40,875
Because you have forgotten the beauty of the nature of Shri Rama.

690
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:46,375
What has He done to our center heart is the greatest thing,

691
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:51,542
that He has given you a fatherhood within us.

692
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:55,208
Because Shri Rama represents the fatherhood.

693
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,583
Now what sort of a father you are, you have to decide.

694
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:01,583
Those people who are not good fathers

695
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,875
develop problems of the right heart.

696
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:08,875
Also those people who are not good husbands

697
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,375
also develop the right heart.

698
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:16,291
This right heart is so important,

699
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:21,500
because  specially in the west where the climate is so funny,

700
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:24,999
you have to keep inside your rooms and closed all the time

701
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,625
that you get all dried up inside

702
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:32,709
at that time if you don’t have that sweetness, that warmth,

703
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:37,083
that kindness of Shri Rama, you get the trouble of asthma.

704
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:41,166
So many people die of asthma in the west.

705
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:44,166
On top of that, you fight with your wives, ill-treat them,

706
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:48,959
you take away their money, you cheat them in their money

707
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:53,291
and every way you torture them then it becomes even worse.

708
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,500
So it has something to do with money, in the sense,

709
00:57:57,709 --> 00:58:04,333
because Sitaji was Shri Lakshmi and Sitaji was the one

710
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:08,417
who, who was the power of Shri Rama.

711
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:12,375
So the Shri Lakshmi also gets annoyed with you

712
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:15,709
when you are a bad father or a bad husband.

713
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:18,792
That’s why the Gruha Lakshmi is very important.

714
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,917
But the woman has to be the Gruha Lakshmi. She should not be a shrew

715
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,625
and then the husband is supposed to be kind to her.

716
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,041
Then it's spoiling. That's very bad.

717
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,208
The woman has to be a Gruha Lakshmi,

718
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:33,625
a beautiful woman with a very sweet nature

719
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:38,041
and talking to her husband in a very sankoch manner

720
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:43,458
and also looking after the children, looking after the family

721
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:47,041
and looking after the guests who come to their house.

722
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:52,166
But if you encourage and run after such women who are no good,

723
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:55,458
means collectively they should be good;

724
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:58,000
if collectively they do not act well,

725
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,041
collectively if they are aggressive,

726
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,999
collectively if they are tormenting others,

727
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:06,125
then such women should not be encouraged at all,

728
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:10,999
but then, Tulsidas says, they should be beaten up.

729
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:16,750
Is a thing looks very bad in modern times if somebody says like that,

730
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:22,500
that women should be beaten up in case they have all such qualities

731
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:26,083
which disqualify them from being Gruha Lakshmis.

732
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:31,250
Of course there’s no need to beat, but I mean to say that what is it

733
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:35,250
that you have to drive out all these baddhas from your women,

734
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:42,291
very important, otherwise if you fall in this activity

735
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,709
of keeping your wives on right lines,

736
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:50,417
you might also get a right heart and asthma ultimately.

737
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:54,875
Because your wife and you are part of the society.

738
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:59,250
And the society has certain laws which are very important.

739
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,458
There’s something like shri dharma, there’s something like pati dharma,

740
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,291
there’s something like mata dharma,

741
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,999
pita dharma, everything has a dharma.

742
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:12,500
Those men who torture their wives have very bad heart.

743
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,834
In the same way, those who play into the hands of their wives

744
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
also have a very bad right heart.

745
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:24,834
You have to be in the balance. You are the husband and she is your wife

746
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,709
and both are responsible for keeping a very good family relationship.

747
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:33,999
It’s not one-sided. It’s not the husband only or the wife

748
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:37,999
but both of them to be in such a manner

749
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:42,250
that they act according to their nature of woman and man,

750
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,917
and respect each other, love each other,

751
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,917
share everything with each other and exist in a way

752
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:52,542
that people should see that there are two wheels of a chariot,

753
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,917
one on the left, one on the right, there’s no imbalance.

754
01:00:56,083 --> 01:01:00,375
They are equal but not similar as I have told many a time.

755
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,834
Now in the case of Shri Rama, He left His wife.

756
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,834
When it came to Sita, She left Him too.

757
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But She left Him as a woman would leave

758
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:14,583
and He left Her as a man would leave.

759
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,083
She also left Him.

760
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:25,583
But in a way that is suitable for a woman to do.

761
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:30,917
And He did it in a way that is suitable to a king.

762
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,041
In the same way, a woman when she acts, she has to act like a woman.

763
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,083
The same thing she may do as the man does,

764
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:44,166
but she has to be a woman or a man has to be a man.

765
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,917
So that’s the Mariada Purushottama,

766
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:50,500
is the one who is the highest among all the men,

767
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:55,917
which is all the Mariadas, all the boundaries that he observes.

768
01:01:56,166 --> 01:02:00,208
The boundaries are such that you do not try to overpower others

769
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:05,999
or you do not try to take their seats.

770
01:02:06,417 --> 01:02:09,834
For example, I’ve seen those who are aggressive

771
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:15,667
also show up in our programs, they will be the first before Me.

772
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:18,417
They will be, as soon as I open the gates,

773
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,500
they’ll be somewhere there standing.

774
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,125
They, they will be the first in everything.

775
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:29,041
That’s not being Mariada. You should be at the back.

776
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,875
Should be…, there are leaders you have got, they can sit in front.

777
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,291
Try to be on the back. “I want to be first..."

778
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,208
Then I’ve said once “the first of the first.”

779
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,041
You know the story of first of the first.

780
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,750
So you become first of the first and that’s what happens to you

781
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,583
when you try to show off.

782
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:52,999
And I know all of them who are like that.

783
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:57,999
To be in the background

784
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:02,792
is the most respectable thing to do.

785
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,500
To go forward first, to jump forward first,

786
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,375
to stand near the door if Mother is coming, you see.

787
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:14,125
As soon as I see the person, I said, “Oh back again.”

788
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,000
There’s some who do Aartis just because to show off,

789
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:21,291
some throw flowers to show off, they must be the first.

790
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,583
And, somehow or another, they get also the position

791
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:28,208
because of their assertions and askings.

792
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,208
The leaders have to be careful

793
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:34,083
and not to give such eyed duties to people

794
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:39,625
who really upset Me very much because of their arrogance,

795
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:45,166
because of their showing offs.

796
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,375
I have to say one thing today that, under the circumstances,

797
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:54,083
we have to decide that if the leaders don’t have wives

798
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:58,999
who are humble, who are kind, who are compassionate

799
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:03,917
and who are Gruha Lakshmis, who are very sweet with the Collective,

800
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:10,583
we’ll have to cancel the husband as well as the wife from the leadership.

801
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:15,583
We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid.

802
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:22,709
We cannot, because the wife of a leader is like a mother.

803
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:30,583
There are five types of mothers described, one of them is the one

804
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:33,959
who is the wife of the guru or of the leader.

805
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,875
And if the leader has a wife of that kind

806
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,917
it’s better in all sense he should withdraw.

807
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,667
Improve his wife. Do whatever is possible.

808
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,959
Till she’s all right, he should not be the leader.

809
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,125
Is a very important thing because I have seen

810
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:53,583
such women bring down the men, not only that,

811
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:56,125
but bring down the Sahaja Yoga,

812
01:04:56,333 --> 01:05:00,750
Sahaja Yogis and the whole organization of God.

813
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:05,792
So one has to be careful  and the women have to understand

814
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:09,041
that if they are the wives of the leaders

815
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,917
they have to be extremely good, kind,

816
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:18,542
generous, sharing, looking after,

817
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:24,083
absolutely motherly, and should not tolerate nonsense

818
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:28,291
and should correct when people are doing wrong.

819
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:31,583
They should not report anyone to their husbands,

820
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:35,875
should not take over themselves the responsibility of doing things

821
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,667
which they are not supposed to do.

822
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:43,999
If they are not of that level, they are of no use to people

823
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:51,250
and they have no business to be proud of being the wives of the leaders.

824
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:59,125
From Shri Rama’s life we learn a lot and from Sitaji’s life also.

825
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:06,041
Both of them have done so much for us, bring forth such a great life.

826
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,917
All their lives they suffered and suffered and suffered.

827
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:13,500
They lived in the villages. They lived in the forest.

828
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,667
While they were the king and the queen they had never known

829
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:21,500
what is discomfort. They traveled all the way bare feet.

830
01:06:21,709 --> 01:06:24,959
They went through all kinds of tortures of life.

831
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:29,959
Sita was taken away by Ravana, who was a horrid man.

832
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:32,542
She had to live with a rakshasa, can you imagine?

833
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:37,291
She lived with a rakshasa and there She showed her greatness.

834
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:44,750
The characters of different nature, like Sita and Shri Rama,

835
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:51,792
they were showing the complementary attributes

836
01:06:51,999 --> 01:06:55,125
that there are, very complementary, and if that is so

837
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:59,834
then the husband wife’s relations beautiful are in Sahaja Yoga.

838
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:04,834
That’s the way it should be. I find some people are very nice.

839
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:09,542
Some leaders are extremely nice, but wives can be very hard,

840
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,999
can be very stiff,

841
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:22,750
or could be very mischievous, could be troublesome, selfish.

842
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:27,709
You cannot grow in Sahaja Yoga with these qualities.

843
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:32,375
It's such a luck and chance that your husband is the leader,

844
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:37,709
is the highest man in your nation in Sahaja Yoga

845
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:43,500
and where you have to be up to his ability,

846
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:49,125
capability and his name, otherwise you have no authority.

847
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:53,375
That’s why I have to tell you that on this day of Dassera,

848
01:07:53,625 --> 01:08:00,375
let us decide that we are going to have Ramraj in Sahaja Yoga,

849
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:05,291
where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion,

850
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:10,959
security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves.

851
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,375
The whole disciplining is within ourselves.

852
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:16,125
What I say about Shri Rama is that

853
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:21,000
He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of Mariadas.

854
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:24,500
In the same way, we ourselves should put ourselves

855
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:28,166
into the discipline of Mariadas.

856
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:32,709
Is a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland

857
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:37,125
because Switzerland needs it the most,

858
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:40,999
the blessings of Shri Ram.

859
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:45,999
The way it is going on in this country,

860
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:53,500
this very selfish, non-benevolent activities going on,

861
01:08:53,792 --> 01:09:00,291
ruining all the poorer nations by this kind of a selfish attitude,

862
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,417
a very narrow attitude, very low level attitude

863
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:10,667
towards the money of these poorer nations.

864
01:09:11,542 --> 01:09:15,875
Is important, very important for us today

865
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:20,083
to pray for the emancipation of the hearts of those people

866
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,959
who are just butchering.

867
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,959
In these modern times, we don’t have wars

868
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:29,125
but financially they are butchering people,

869
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:34,291
they are killing them by depriving them of their own money

870
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,542
and their own benevolence.

871
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:41,500
So, if Ramraja has to come,

872
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:45,667
then Rama is to be born in the hearts of people

873
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,959
who are at the helm of affairs. And that’s how

874
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:53,667
we have to pray to Shri Ram  that, “Be kind and compassionate

875
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:58,208
so that you could be born into the hearts of these people.”

876
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:03,959
May God bless you all.

877
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:12,083
May I have some water please.

878
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,000
I do not know, how I spoke today, because the vibrations are so much,

879
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,959
it's very difficult.

880
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,500
Can I have some water please. Thank you
