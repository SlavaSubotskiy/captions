1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:10,110
Today somebody came from India and told me
that, “You better change the name Sahaja

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,740
Yoga into some other name.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,240
So I said, “What about Maha Yoga?”

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,160
And he liked it very much.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:26,030
He said, “Now people are taking Sahaj Yoga
as their own and they are using it for their

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,030
own purpose."

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,160
I said, “Very good idea.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,730
If they are using it, is even better!

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:40,460
Because the word itself suggests that this
union has to be spontaneous.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,850
They have to give a spontaneous union.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,090
If they claim it, they have to do it.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,520
If they are not doing it, then it is wrong.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,660
It’s very simple!”

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:01:02,470
But he said, “In any case Sahaj Yoga does
not denote the dimension which it has reached:

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,990
that people are getting en-masse Realisation."

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,899
Moreover he said that people don’t understand
that the time has come for thousands of people

17
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,740
to get their Realisation.

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,350
Perhaps we are not aware [of] what time we
are born.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,939
So many people are seeking God.

20
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:36,880
Never in the history before there was such
a multitude which was seriously seeking God,

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,469
and honestly wanting to get their union.

22
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:50,459
Only in the modern times you find they are
very honest, very sincere; and they are born

23
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,459
seekers.

24
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:56,829
I mean their quality is that they are seekers;
their temperament is that they are seekers.

25
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:04,060
They are not satisfied with anything else
but seeking.

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,319
Why this is happening?

27
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,700
We have to think about it.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,680
Why people are not satisfied with what they
have?

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:23,819
Why are they not seeking now the materialism
or the powers which are other than the Divine

30
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,819
Power?

31
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,569
Why do they want that they should know their
Spirit?

32
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:31,670
What is the reason?

33
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,280
Why such an upsurge?

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,230
And why people, like mad, are following anyone
who comes across?

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,060
To try every method and experiment with everything
to get that bliss and joy.

36
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,340
You know [that], from ancient times, people
have been talking about your rebirth.

37
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:06,329
Even at the time of Rama, one disciple called
as Nachiketa, went to the father-in-law of

38
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:13,480
Rama, whose name was Raja Janaka, and asked
Him that, “Give me Self-knowledge."

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:23,560
And Nachiketa was very, very anxious, very
much wanting to be the Spirit.

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,549
But Janaka put him to many, many tests.

41
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,010
And the conversation between them is very
interesting.

42
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,879
So one individual is mentioned in those days
— I mean that’s a long time back, Rama’s

43
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,079
time — who was seeking.

44
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:54,400
Even at the time of Christ there was, we would
say, John the Baptist who talked of baptism.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:04,200
But as far as seeking is concerned, in the
multitude, there was no such urge, there was

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,989
not that seeking as you find today.

47
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,480
So there must be something in the atmosphere.

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,670
Then another thing is that we are trying to
save time.

49
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,290
We must have watches.

50
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,630
We must see that [watch] after every ten minutes.

51
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,490
Oh, we have to save time.

52
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,490
We cannot waste time.

53
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,310
I mean, supposing somebody has to go to India,
then a date is fixed, and then he must go

54
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,960
by that plane, particular plane.

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,500
If that plane is missed, he thinks he’s
lost the world!

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,840
Time-saving is another urge within us.

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,110
Why do we want to save time?

58
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,390
Why this urge from the unconscious is so strong
that we must save time?

59
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,330
Is there something going wrong or something
is going to happen?

60
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,470
Or is there some urgency or emergency which
you feel in the time itself?

61
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,540
Because, in the olden times, nobody used to
worry so much about time.

62
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,200
So what is the reason for this kind of time-saving
today?

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:13,650
We can see very clearly that there are genuine
seekers.

64
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,471
There are seekers because of the faction around.

65
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:24,260
And there are people who do not seek; who
are quite satisfied with whatever mundane

66
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,380
life they are leading, or whatever ambitions
they have other than seeking.

67
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:39,710
But the genuine seekers are so many in number
that we have to find out why this genuine

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,960
seeking is working so much.

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,770
And you are so restless about it, so anxious
that, without the seeking, you are not satisfied.

70
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,600
You are willing to give up everything that
is on this Earth with you, or whatever is

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,130
your own so-called possessions, but you want
to seek yourself.

72
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,190
That’s a fact; it’s absolutely honest.

73
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,740
There’s no doubt about it.

74
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,270
But why there is seeking?

75
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,290
It is because the Last Judgment has started.

76
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,210
The Last Judgment has started now.

77
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,320
Many great souls are taking birth.

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:29,060
It is very common these days, you talk to
anyone about his child [and] they will tell

79
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:36,350
two things: Either he is a grand old man,
some ancient figure born in the family and

80
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,520
every word he speaks is wisdom.

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,780
Or the other thing they may tell you is that
he’s a monster, he’s good for nothing,

82
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,240
he is useless.

83
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,060
Nothing in between!

84
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,680
Now this happening also was very uncommon.

85
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:02,660
Now we have seen, so many of you, who are
Sahaj Yogis, that so many children are born-realised.

86
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,610
I mean, when I was born, I found very, very
few people.

87
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,160
Except for my father I couldn’t find anyone
who was born-realised.

88
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:19,470
And there were many fakirs and saints, who
came to our house, or we went to see them,

89
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,470
and I found that their Kundalini was all frozen.

90
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,810
They may be calling themselves saints or whatever
it is.

91
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,430
But I was amazed that there was no companionship
with them because you couldn’t talk [to

92
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,430
them].

93
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,500
They were at a very low level of evolution
and they were just trying to make money or

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,630
give some sort of technique or some sort of
a blah, blah, blah.

95
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,150
Even then it was so.

96
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:53,420
But innately in a country like India people
know what to seek, what to find.

97
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:03,840
Now, because of your righteous life in previous
births, I believe, maybe, or whatever it is:

98
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,560
as a blessing of that you are born in these
countries where there is affluence, where

99
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,180
your attention does not go to material things
so much, but to higher things.

100
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,150
And then you start thinking that all this
is a waste, a junk and we are not going to

101
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,200
carry the junk of our parents on our heads.

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Some sort of feeling crawls up and you start
seeking.

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:38,900
In England I don’t know how many children
I have seen who are born-realised, of a very

104
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
high quality.

105
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,460
Such great souls are taking birth on this
Earth.

106
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,570
Why?

107
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,030
It never happened before.

108
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:55,740
And within these ten years’ time, such a
tremendous in-flow of these great souls is

109
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:02,900
felt that one has to realise that there is
a kind of an emergency.

110
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:12,050
This emergency is felt also even in those
people who are not yet seeking.

111
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,580
They are so speedy; they are so anxious; they
get into stress and they get into tensions.

112
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,860
If you ask your forefathers who had gone out
to wars: they never had tensions.

113
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,730
They would kill ten people and sleep off nicely
without thinking about it.

114
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,530
They didn’t even have the sensitivity that
you have, that compassion and that understanding.

115
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:40,030
With this growth within, or we can say, with
this urge within, also there are many things

116
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:47,950
that have happened outside that you can see
very clearly: is that a consciousness has

117
00:09:47,950 --> 00:10:02,670
come, a collective awareness has come, as
to the idea of cruelty, wars and also domination

118
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,400
of other people.

119
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,141
Perhaps none of you could be as old as I am
here.

120
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,360
I have seen this working out.

121
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,150
People are so much changed in their ideas.

122
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,090
There’s such a revolution that you cannot
think [of] a person like Christ, today to

123
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,440
be born and to be crucified.

124
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
Of course you may misunderstand.

125
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,880
You may not like Him because He’s a carpenter’s
son, He’s too simple, He talks of spontaneity;

126
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,460
He doesn’t give you any technique; He doesn’t
take any money from you; He doesn’t organise.

127
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:40,620
You may not like Him, and you may deny Him
also thinking that He’s just useless, but

128
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,610
you cannot crucify [Him].

129
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,360
Under any law you cannot do it.

130
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,750
Imagine what a development of society has
also taken place!

131
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,400
And we understand what is wrong.

132
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,760
For example now, Afghanistan was invaded:
everybody, everyone in the whole world, was

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,940
feeling that it was wrong.

134
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:11,190
When one of the satellites was falling, and
there were some astronauts caught up in that,

135
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,430
the whole world was watching.

136
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,670
I mean, they were not Indians and they were
not Egyptians, but everywhere people were

137
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,980
watching that they should come down safely.

138
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,900
Everybody was praying in their own way that,
“Oh God, they must be safe!”

139
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,740
Because of the development outside we are
so much connected with each other: there’s

140
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,740
such an articulation of our thoughts and our
ideas and our feelings and our sensitivities

141
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,360
that, anything happens in any part of our
country, we do feel, in any part of the world,

142
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,670
we feel; anywhere anything happens to someone,
we feel it.

143
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,680
So our collectivity has also become sharper
and sensitive.

144
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,580
It’s a remarkable time we are born in.

145
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,330
You are very fortunate and lucky people.

146
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:04,080
And your age group specially is specially
blessed because, at this time, you are well-read,

147
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,080
you know all about it and you are just there
to understand and get it.

148
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:19,870
But, as I said, that, in a country like India
where, from ancient times, there has been

149
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:29,250
a big search within, much more known to them
were the truths of life.

150
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,380
They knew what they were seeking, they knew
what they had to seek and what is to expect

151
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,060
in your seeking.

152
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,870
Though I would say India is today sleeping
compared to you people.

153
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,620
You are awake, you are definitely awake.

154
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,010
Those who know what to seek are sleeping;
those who are awake do not know what to seek.

155
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,130
It’s a funny situation!

156
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:05,279
But we can understand it by understanding
one fact, that, when the tree grows outside

157
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,720
too much we must know that the roots must
have grown down deep, otherwise the tree cannot

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,390
be sustained.

159
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:22,550
If, in the West, we have grown very much outside,
in the East maybe one or two roots, maybe,

160
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,290
have gone deep down to find out the source
to sustain this tree.

161
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,870
For me, east and west doesn’t exit.

162
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,630
Nor does it exist for anything that is Divine.

163
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,400
It’s a human conception of east and west
and these countries and all that.

164
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
It’s only one map, a beautiful picture God
has created.

165
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,690
Only human beings think that we are different
and they are different.

166
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,770
Of course He has created varieties just to
create the joy of beauty.

167
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:56,060
But He never created east, west, north, south
and the difference between the people.

168
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,670
That’s our own conception.

169
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,620
[But], whatever it is, definitely in the growth
there are two types of people: one are the

170
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,030
people who are growing outside, extroversion
is much more, people are seeking outside,

171
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,490
and there are people who are seeking inside.

172
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,310
I would say like the Pisces, you see, they
have two fishes: one fish is seeking inside

173
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,960
and one fish is seeking outside.

174
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,370
In the same way the whole universe looks to
me that some are seeking outside and some

175
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,540
are seeking inside.

176
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:43,070
Now those who are seekers of the Divine must
take some guidance from people who have found

177
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,040
out something before.

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,600
For example, I had a big discussion with a
gentleman who said, “This is occidental

179
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,800
and this is that…” and all.

180
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,270
I asked him, “Who was Christ?

181
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,240
Was He born in England or in America?

182
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,710
Why did you accept Him?”

183
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,540
I mean He has to be born somewhere!

184
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,470
After all, either He’ll be born in the East
or in the West.

185
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,160
Supposing He’s born in the West: so the
Eastern people should say that, “Because

186
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,290
He was born in the West, we’ll reject Him."

187
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,150
He is born in the East so Western people should
say, “We will reject Him because He was

188
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,430
born in the East!”

189
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,730
This is absurd!

190
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,190
I mean, a person can be born in one place
only, he cannot be born everywhere.

191
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,330
He has to be born somewhere.

192
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,770
But these kind of localised identifications
have led to lots of problems in the minds

193
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,250
of people.

194
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,459
As scientists we have to keep our mind very,
very open to understand what search people

195
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:53,020
have made in the inner being, to find out
what are we made of, why are we here, why

196
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,720
did we get our evolution from amoeba to this
stage, where have we to reach.

197
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,060
We have to understand the other side of the
picture.

198
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,330
And [it’s] much more necessary for people
who are now seeking that which was found out

199
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,330
in the East.

200
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,660
And Eastern people are seeking that which
you have found out here.

201
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,950
They are getting developed, you see, they
are now getting sophisticated.

202
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:24,270
While you are trying to find out something
which they had found out without much sophistication.

203
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:34,120
In the ancient times, a long, long time back,
we had three types of people working out the

204
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
seeking.

205
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,720
The first type I would say were the people
who were on the left hand side of this Primordial

206
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,910
Being which you see there with a blue line
.

207
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,580
Have you something to show them?

208
00:16:49,580 --> 00:17:01,940
This blue line is the representative of a
channel called Ida Nadi.

209
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:09,110
And this channel was discovered thousands
of years back in India.

210
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:14,880
This channel represents the power of desire
within us.

211
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:23,519
And the desire reached such a subtle form
that there was a desire to meet God, to be

212
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,339
one with your Spirit; that’s the last desire.

213
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:39,489
And this desire became what you call as the
power of devotion or dedication or for asking,

214
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,070
“Oh Lord, when are we going to meet?

215
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,919
You must come, and we are waiting for You,”
and all such things which shows that people

216
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,740
believed that there was some Superior Power
and that we had to receive the help from that

217
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Superior Power.

218
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,919
This was one side or one type of people who
existed.

219
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:08,630
And the other side [that] you see is the yellow
line: this is the power of our action.

220
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,460
The channel is called as Pingala channel.

221
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,559
These are all very subtle channels inside
our spinal cord.

222
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:27,529
This Pingala channel expressed in the people
who went into action.

223
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:36,369
Now the power of action in the West, I think,
is a later manifestation of the way people

224
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,289
acted in India.

225
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:45,159
By this power they try to find out the mysteries
of the matter.

226
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,860
As you know matter is made of five elements.

227
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:55,149
So they wanted to know how to overpower the
matter; how to harness it, how to use it.

228
00:18:55,149 --> 00:19:01,279
And they tried to find out which are the Deities
which are ruling the material side of life.

229
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,389
For example, which is the Deity for the sea,
what is the Deity for water, what is the Deity

230
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,070
for Sun, Moon and other stars, and all those
things.

231
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:16,690
And Greeks, I think, went further with it,
very much further, and they got into a wrong

232
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,840
path and they got lost.

233
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:31,509
But this was the search where people tried
to excite or to master the methods by which

234
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:35,870
you could control all these five elements.

235
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,730
And this method is expressed in our Vedas.

236
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:48,049
‘Vida’ means ‘to know’; and the Vedas
are the expressions of all the mantras which

237
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,499
were used to harness the matter.

238
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:57,369
The result of that is, today, what we feel,
is science: that, through that, now science

239
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,669
is manifested as knowledge to us.

240
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,330
But first they tried to, say, overpower the
fire.

241
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:10,029
Now there is one way of overpowering the fire:
is from outside to use the fire for cooking,

242
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,010
for this, that, all sorts of things.

243
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,470
Or there could be a method by which you find
out the Deity that rules the fire.

244
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,359
If you can excite the Deity that rules the
fire and can control that Deity or you are

245
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:30,929
connected with that Deity, then you can manage
to use the fire the way you like.

246
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,630
So the second type of people who went into
these mantras and yagyas and all these things:

247
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,080
they did the fire ceremonies and tried to
control the Sun, Moon and all sort of things;

248
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,269
they were interested [in that].

249
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:50,239
But now the third type of people, who existed
in the centre, in the central path.

250
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:55,600
This path is called as the Sushumna path,
and this path is responsible for our evolution

251
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,870
from amoeba to this stage.

252
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:04,600
Because of this power within us, to evolve,
we became human beings.

253
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,279
Why did we become human beings?

254
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,279
Nobody asks!

255
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,279
We should ask some questions!

256
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,580
All the scientists must ask questions [such
as]: Why did we become human beings?

257
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,990
Why some animals were discarded, and why we
are supposed to be on top of all the evolutionary

258
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,990
process?

259
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,120
And now what is our goal?

260
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,929
Why are we there?

261
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:25,679
What are we to achieve?

262
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:37,190
This central path is a very, very important
path for us, for Sahaja Yoga, because, by

263
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,269
these different chakras that there are, the
one is the lower one, then the second, the

264
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:50,359
third and the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh:
these seven chakras denote vertically our

265
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,330
evolution — vertically.

266
00:21:52,330 --> 00:22:00,460
And horizontally they express our physical,
mental, emotional being.

267
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,899
The first chakra is very important.

268
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,320
This chakra is the centre of Mooladhara.

269
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,220
‘Mooladhara’ means ‘the support of the
root’.

270
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,120
This centre is the centre of our innocence.

271
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,509
The first thing that was created on this Earth
was innocence.

272
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,029
Innocence is the first power that was created.

273
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,580
And that’s what we had to preserve first
of all.

274
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,559
That was the most important thing to preserve:
is our innocence.

275
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,249
Now you will be surprised that this centre
is placed under the Kundalini, not above the

276
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:41,249
Kundalini.

277
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,330
Kundalini is above that.

278
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,769
Now this Kundalini is the power which is placed
in the sacrum bone, nowhere else.

279
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,950
I mean people can tell you, I have heard the
other day, he was saying, that, “We believe

280
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,230
the Kundalini is here."

281
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,010
I said, “You can believe it, it is here!

282
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,429
I mean, but by believing it is not there!”

283
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:02,080
Because what you see is the pulsation of Kundalini
in this area.

284
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,480
When Sahaja Yoga starts, in many people, with
the naked eyes, you can see the pulsation

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,330
of the Kundalini in this area, on people who
have got some obstruction.

286
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,759
Those who are all right they just get their
Realisation without any difficulties.

287
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,880
But [with] those who have obstruction, many
of you have seen the pulsation in the sacrum

288
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
bone.

289
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,889
And imagine this bone is called ‘sacrum’!

290
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:22,239
‘Sacrum’ means ‘sacred’.

291
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:25,520
So they knew that there was something in it.

292
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,119
Even the Greeks, I think.

293
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,010
Latin is not Greek, but we can say in Latin
language it is called as sacred.

294
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:37,640
So the sacred bone was containing this Sacred
Power within us known as ‘Kundalini’.

295
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,539
This is the primule, is the germinating power
within us.

296
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:50,669
Now this fact has been accepted for thousands
of years in India and elsewhere.

297
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:58,559
In the Bible also it is said that Moses saw
the tree of fire.

298
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,179
That tree of fire is nothing but the whole
Kundalini instrument.

299
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:10,279
They talk of the Tree of Life: that is the
same as this.

300
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,559
In the Bible it is said, “I will appear
before you like tongues of flames,” [this]

301
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,879
is nothing but these centres.

302
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:20,080
And these centres, you can see clearly within
yourself, look like living flames as these

303
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
are.

304
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,960
But these are static, and they are moving
and living.

305
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:31,289
So this is the thing that is being described
in our ancient books, in all the scriptures.

306
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,529
Even in Koran they have described as ‘Ruh’,
R-U-H, ‘Ruh’.

307
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:39,259
‘Ruh’ means the cool breeze, the cool
breeze.

308
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:44,989
The Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost is described
in the Bible also.

309
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,919
You cannot suddenly start a new idea about
something.

310
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,909
If it is an evolutionary process, if it is
a living process, it must have its background,

311
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:59,000
its history and it must culminate into something
fruitful.

312
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,769
Like every fruit has a tree behind it and
roots behind it.

313
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,029
You cannot just come out from somewhere and
say, “See now, I have created a fruit!

314
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:07,890
Now this fruit can become like this."

315
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,590
It has no meaning.

316
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,130
It must be a plastic fruit.

317
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,379
It cannot be a real fruit.

318
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:17,299
If it is a living fruit it has to come out
of the tree.

319
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:22,539
That has existed for thousands and thousands
of years and out of that this tree has to

320
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:23,539
come.

321
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,610
It must have the base.

322
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,320
And this is traditionally called as the Kundalini
awakening process.

323
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,809
Now, this was done, as I told you, there was
only one person at the time of Rama, Nachiketa

324
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:35,840
who tried to find it.

325
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,429
Yoga Vasishtha was a realised-soul, no doubt,
but he did not give Realisation to anyone.

326
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,279
Only Raja Janaka gave Realisation to one fellow
called Nachiketa.

327
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:51,109
Even Zen system in which people were supposed
to get their Realisation: they said that nobody

328
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:55,340
got Realisation except that there were twenty-six
kashyapas.

329
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,740
‘Kashyapas’ means “realised-souls”.

330
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,470
Only twenty-six, because I think it started
about the sixth century.

331
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,109
And for six centuries they had these kashyapas
coming and going, one at a time.

332
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,340
And after that they had none, they had none.

333
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,929
So there are no realised-souls there either.

334
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,509
Christ has said very clearly that, “You
are to be born again."

335
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:25,149
I mean the whole message of Christ’s life
is Realisation.

336
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:34,539
Because Judaism talked of the dharma, of the
sustenance, of maintenance of the balance

337
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,820
in the centre.

338
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,049
That also, like a tree, that was very important.

339
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:47,850
But then Christ came on this Earth to show
that you have to become the Spirit.

340
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,590
By His resurrection He showed that.

341
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,320
And this is the message of Christ.

342
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,019
But in Christianity, I don’t know how many
people are seeking.

343
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,299
They think that by going to church every morning
it’s finished.

344
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:08,210
Same with the Indians where it was said in
every scripture, even about Vedas the first

345
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:14,080
thing is said that, “Through this knowledge
if you cannot seek your Spirit, it’s all

346
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
useless."

347
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,830
Then we had people like Shankaracharya, Adi
Shankaracharya, who was the person who tried

348
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,039
to re-establish Hinduism.

349
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,029
Who has said that, “Without getting Realisation,
what’s this life?”

350
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:26,029
“Na yogye, na sankhye."

351
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,889
(meaning: neither by ‘yoga’ nor ‘sankhya’
it is achieved’) By all this talking, blah,

352
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,542
blah blahs, where are you going to lie?

353
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:35,659
You have to get the grace of the Mother to
get your Realisation.

354
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:42,049
When he talked first of ‘Vivekachudamani’,
a very big book he wrote, on treaties of Indian

355
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,149
philosophy, people were amazed at his knowledge.

356
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:50,159
But later on he just wrote ‘Saundarya Lahari’
which is just the description of the Cool

357
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,519
Breeze of the Holy Ghost and of the Holy Ghost.

358
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,029
And people said, “What are you doing?

359
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:57,070
You are just praising the Holy Ghost and not
writing any philosophy."

360
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,009
He said, “There is no philosophy.

361
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:04,460
It’s a spontaneous thing which should happen
to all of us, and just the praise is the way

362
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
you get it."

363
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,529
Just imagine a person of his calibre.

364
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:13,700
But what are the Hindus doing today is nothing
but the same old-style techniques and ritualism

365
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,379
and all nonsense; they are also lost.

366
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:26,020
I mean there is such a pickle, made out of
every great incarnation, that to me it was

367
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:33,559
a shock to see how they have been able to
spoil every incarnation into zero, and some

368
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:41,919
sort of a nonsensical image of every incarnation
who came on this Earth to emancipate, to give

369
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,509
you a higher life, a higher awareness.

370
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:50,720
So we come to the point where we have to think
what we have to expect.

371
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,470
The first thing is: if it is a living process,
it has to be spontaneous.

372
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:05,580
This is very difficult for people to understand:
that it has to be spontaneous.

373
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:13,140
For example, if this flower has to become
the fruit, what is the technique?

374
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,149
Do you stand before it for hours together
or do you jump before it, or you stand on

375
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:23,529
your heads [so] that it becomes?

376
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:29,229
Anything spontaneous [that] you have seen,
which is living, happens by itself.

377
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,999
There is no technique.

378
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:35,149
When I say there is no technique, people do
not want to believe it, because technique

379
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,149
they want.

380
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,759
But you have taken for granted all these things,
isn’t it?

381
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:47,200
I mean, one day you are sleeping, you find
that the blossom time has come, lots of flowers

382
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,399
are there.

383
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,769
One morning you get up you find most of the
flowers have become fruits, and you take it

384
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:53,769
for granted.

385
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,419
Do you ask for a technique there?

386
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,239
In the same way what technique did you employ
to become human beings from amoeba?

387
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:04,399
Say from monkey’s state to human beings:
did you cut your tails to become human beings?

388
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,741
Didn’t we become spontaneously that?

389
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:08,741
It’s rather difficult to accept.

390
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:13,700
But logically, you tell me, if it is a living
process, what do we have do?

391
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:20,179
It is impossible to explain to people that
there is no technique.

392
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,200
They must have a technique.

393
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,870
Now why do we want to have a technique?Let
us face ourselves.

394
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:33,229
Because we think we must do something about
it: if we are not doing anything about it,

395
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:34,899
then how can we get it?

396
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:40,529
Because we think whatever we have got in this
world is through our effort, by working for

397
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:41,529
it.

398
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:42,529
But what have you got?

399
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:43,529
You’ve got everything dead!

400
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,529
Say for example, something is dead, these
stones are dead and you have made a building

401
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:46,110
out of it.

402
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,159
So what?

403
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,879
Dead from the dead!

404
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:53,129
What have you got living with you?

405
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:55,690
Have you got any living powers?

406
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,599
Can you give life to a fruit or to a tree?

407
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,730
You cannot.

408
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,730
What have you achieved?

409
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,730
Is only dead.

410
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,259
With effort you can only achieve dead.

411
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,179
Have you achieved anything living?

412
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:13,259
If you put such a question to yourself then
you will understand that living processes,

413
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:19,840
we have to accept, are spontaneous: we cannot
put any technique on it.

414
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,659
As soon as we want to have technique, we must
know this is our Mr Ego who wants to get satisfied.

415
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,590
I have seen people doing that.

416
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:37,190
For example I will give you a very concrete
example of a gentleman who came to me and

417
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,190
he said, “No, no.

418
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,190
How can be it that be simple Mother?

419
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,190
How can it be that simple?”

420
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,499
I told him that, “See: your breathing is
so simple.

421
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:47,879
If you have to read books and go into techniques
for your breathing, how many people would

422
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,080
be living?”

423
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,349
But he would not accept me.

424
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,779
He said, “You must give us a technique otherwise
we’ll not be happy."

425
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:59,379
Now there’s a very great realised-soul living
in India but he is a very strict person, he’s

426
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:01,899
not a Mother and he has no tolerance for any
nonsense.

427
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:06,290
So he had once told me, “If somebody troubles
you, send the fellow over to me."

428
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,290
So I told him, “You go and see the guruji,
such and such."

429
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,149
He was very enamoured that, “This gentleman
has called me!”

430
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:16,599
So he had to climb up seven miles up on a
hill where this gentleman was sitting there.

431
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:21,029
He went there, and he started talking, “Blah,
blah, blah,” to him that, “See, Mother

432
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,609
doesn’t give any technique to us and She’s
just giving Realisation to every Dick, Tom

433
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,639
and Harry and this and that!”

434
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,639
He said, “Yah!

435
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:27,950
Really, She’s doing wrong, isn’t it?

436
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,140
All right, you be here and you eat your food
and sleep here!”

437
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,210
After a month I found the gentleman came to
see me with both his legs round his neck,

438
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,450
dangling in the air.

439
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,169
I said, “What’s happened?”

440
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:44,110
I mean, really tears came into my eyes and
I said, “What’s happened?

441
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,169
What this guru has done to him?”

442
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,289
He came and started crying.

443
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:49,739
He said, “Mother, never send me to that
guru."

444
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:54,190
I said, “But you were very anxious to go
to him, because you wanted something to climb

445
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,190
up to see him."

446
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,719
He said, “He made really a mess out of me."

447
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:03,129
In the night because this guru, his limbs
are broken and hands are broken, so he goes

448
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,129
on a tiger.

449
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:06,940
So he said, “And this tiger came and pushed
me into a ghat!

450
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,840
And I was lying there about thirteen, fourteen
feet down below, and this guru after three,

451
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,749
four days lowered down some rotis, some breads
to me, and he said, “Now eat it and stay

452
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,749
there.

453
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,229
And till you promise me that you will not
go and trouble Mataji, I am not going to take

454
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,169
you out of this place!”

455
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:29,919
And then after two days he sent a few people
to pick him up and brought.

456
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,590
He said, “I am not here to take money from
you.

457
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,289
You cannot give me money, anything.

458
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:37,249
But I will only teach you a good lesson!”

459
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,389
He said, “I have had enough of it."

460
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:43,759
He said, “Now you take these legs around
your neck, go dangling to Mataji, and She’s

461
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,929
going to cure you.

462
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,369
I am not going to cure you.

463
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,950
And don’t come and tell me stories!”

464
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,349
“Oh God” I said, “Look at this,” then
of course we tried and worked on him, that’s

465
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:53,349
a different point.

466
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:54,349
But this is what it is.

467
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:57,519
He said he wants technique, so he gave him
a technique.

468
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,080
Another fellow who was like this, a doctor,
he was troubling me, and I didn’t tell him,

469
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,549
but he felt that he should go and see this
guru.

470
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:10,270
And for one month he made this fellow clean
a Shiva’s temple, taking the water seven

471
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,750
miles every day, morning and evening: with
one bucket cleaning in Shiva’s temple!

472
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,810
And doctor came back, he was so thinned down,
absolutely exhausted.

473
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,629
I said, “What’s the matter?”

474
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:23,059
He said, “I was cleaning Shiva’s temple
for a month!”

475
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:26,639
So when I met this guru I asked him, “Why
did you do that to him?”

476
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,990
He said, “For a donkey, you better give
donkey’s job!

477
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,620
It’s no use telling them something of the
higher life.

478
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,070
They don’t want it.

479
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,510
They want donkey’s life.

480
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:39,659
So let them jump and do what they like.

481
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,299
Let them be donkeys.

482
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:45,990
Why should You try to give them [everything]
so simple?”

483
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,990
I was amazed at him.

484
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,560
He said, “Mother, you are a Mother and you
do what you like because this is your whim.

485
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,799
But as far as we are concerned we are not
going to give Realisation to anyone.

486
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,129
I have given it to one, and he’s become
a hopeless man."

487
00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:02,150
So I went to see this gentleman one day, the
one who took twenty-five years to get his

488
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,150
Realisation.

489
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,440
And because somebody, one of my disciples
had to invite him.

490
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,170
Now this fellow was smoking cigarettes like
this, sitting before me and he was talking

491
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,599
quite a lot, and there were girls and women
pressing his feet and doing all kinds of things.

492
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:19,170
Of course he got up, touched my feet.

493
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,240
He sat down, then he started saying that,
“Now why this [Gagangiri] Maharaj is coming

494
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,730
to see you in Bombay?

495
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,240
After all he should not leave his place.

496
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,059
He has been there for a hundred and eight
years,” this, that.

497
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,740
I said, “Who are you to judge him?

498
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,780
Why are you judging him?

499
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
He’s your guru.

500
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Why should you judge him?

501
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
He has given you Realisation."

502
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
“Yes, yes, he’s given me Realisation,
I know.

503
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
But I can also tell him something."

504
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,930
I said, “But what about your smoking?

505
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,160
You are still on with the smoking."

506
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,630
“Oh, I don’t care.

507
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,090
I am beyond everything!”

508
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,560
I said, “All right."

509
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,540
Then I sat down watching him for a while.

510
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,920
I said, “Now I am going home."

511
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I said, “You apply this tika to me."

512
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,630
I said, “All right, first I will apply,”
so I applied [to] him.

513
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:00,240
I said, “Now you apply,” and I sucked
his finger, this is Agnya’s finger of ego.

514
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,060
I sucked his finger on my Agnya, and he went
on “Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!” like that.

515
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
He said, “Mother, Mother, Mother what you
are doing?”

516
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,420
I said, “Nothing, nothing.

517
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,170
You are great, you are a realised-soul.

518
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,710
Why should you shake before me?

519
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,740
Why are you shaking?

520
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,849
Why don’t you get all right?

521
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:14,849
Why are you shaking?”

522
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:16,420
He said, “No, no, no please stop it, stop
it."

523
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,119
I said, “Now, first promise that you are
not going to talk ill of your guru and stop

524
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,299
all this nonsense of having women around and
making money!”

525
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:29,799
But then the person with whom he went, he
swindled them completely, just imagine!

526
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:35,180
And I asked this gentleman who met me at the
airport, “Why did you give money to this

527
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
man?”

528
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,920
They said, “Mother, because he said, ‘See,
I was shaking before Mother because I was

529
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
giving power to Her!’”

530
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
I said, “Such fools!

531
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Why did you give him the money?

532
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,200
Why didn’t you ask me what was happening?”

533
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,819
This is what it is.

534
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:55,010
When you want technique, then in the market
there are thousand and one to give you technique,

535
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,010
anything.

536
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,200
They may tell you that put this [candle] on
your head, light this, and walk on the street.

537
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,779
And you will find thousands of them walking
like this, and the price of this [candle]

538
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:05,650
will go up in the market, and people will
be doing it.

539
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:12,309
Any sort of nonsense they will give you, they
would like to do it!

540
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:18,940
For example, these people at Oxford Street:
they are standing there, [the] Hareramas.

541
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,430
They had cleaned their hair completely and
applied those, what we call them shendis in

542
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,530
India, I don’t know what you call.

543
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,990
And they are sold in the market; do you know?

544
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,920
Like all other wigs, they are sold as wigs
there, and that is to applied there.

545
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
And when they were dancing that was falling
down, you know!

546
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,599
And the dress and sari they were wearing was
also falling down!

547
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,359
And such foolish people.

548
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,980
I said, “What do they think?

549
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,830
By doing this, are they going to get God?”

550
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:52,140
I said, “But why don’t you sit down and
receive the blessings and why to do [this]?”

551
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,380
They said, “But what’s wrong in clothes.

552
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,570
What is the need to have clothes?”

553
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,750
I said, “That’s not the point!

554
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:03,329
What I am saying if by becoming naked, if
you can become God, all the animals must go

555
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,430
to God first, before you!”

556
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,980
You must understand what should happen to
you: is there should be a new dimension which

557
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
must be enlightened within you.

558
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,450
A new dimension must come into you.

559
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,630
What about your own power: have you got you
own powers?

560
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,260
If you are spiritually evolved, you must have
your own powers.

561
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,529
This is like enslavement.

562
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:25,529
I said, “What are our own powers?”

563
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,780
I said, “Can you tell in this person where
is the Kundalini?”

564
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,160
They said, “No, we don’t know.

565
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,569
We have never heard about it."

566
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,599
“Can you tell what are your centres catching?

567
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,200
Can you tell where are his centres rising?”

568
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,980
He said, “No, we cannot."

569
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:41,880
So I called him, I said, “Come along, have
your Realisation."

570
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,710
One of them I got hold of, somehow or other
brought him.

571
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,270
I think he was not interested in Realisation
at all.

572
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,270
He was not at all interested.

573
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,089
He was interested in exhibitionism.

574
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:55,000
He wanted to exhibition himself in that Oxford
Street that’s why he went there.

575
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Absolutely that’s true.

576
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,359
Otherwise, if he was, he would have said,
“All right, if you are saying ‘I am giving

577
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,690
you Realisation,’ let me have it!”

578
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,220
He said, “How can that be so silly?”

579
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
I said, “What silly?

580
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,270
I said, “How can it be silly?”

581
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,859
I said, “The wisest”.

582
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:14,340
But must be somebody else is silly to see
things which are silly.

583
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,180
Like mad people: if you go to a lunatic asylum
they think you all are mad.

584
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:24,920
Once our prime minister went to a lunatic
asylum and one lunatic came and started talking

585
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
to him very nicely.

586
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
He said, “How are you?

587
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,330
When did you come here?

588
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,330
And who are you?”

589
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,900
So he said, “I am Jawaharlal Nehru, I am
the prime minister of India."

590
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,829
He said, “All right, all right, you’ll
be all right also.

591
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:38,170
I used to say the same thing."

592
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,440
(laughter)

593
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,549
But how do you judge whether you are right
or wrong?

594
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:44,950
Where are you?

595
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:50,190
The judgment comes when you have the dimension
to judge.

596
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,260
When you are Realised you can judge.

597
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,589
You can say what chakras are catching.

598
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:59,760
When Self-realisation comes in, you know all
about these centres and you know all about

599
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,880
these channels; about yourself and about others.

600
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,039
The collective consciousness becomes an actualisation;
it becomes part and parcel of you.

601
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,720
Like an egg when it gets transformed, you
really get a bird!

602
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,410
It’s not just “blah, blah, blah."

603
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,930
You just get to see the bird with its wings
and everything.

604
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,359
A transformation takes place.

605
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,089
Your awareness must have that actual dimension
within itself, inside.

606
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:33,430
Not outside by developing your some sort of
a horn or wearing some sort of a bushy hair.

607
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,789
It’s something that happens to you within
where…(break in recording)…comes through

608
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,650
when you start judging yourself.

609
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,740
But God is compassion.

610
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,289
He’s love.

611
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:55,119
He gives you [the] chance, all the powers
to clear yourself and cleanse yourself.

612
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:03,480
But nobody can help a person who is so dump
founded or mesmerised or who is such a, I

613
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,290
would say, unintelligent person; who doesn’t
understand that something has to happen to

614
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,460
your awareness.

615
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,190
Then only you have achieved something.

616
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:21,430
For days in and days out they are going and
going and going and achieving nothing.

617
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,119
Somebody told me, “Oh, they are people who
love each other very much."

618
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,119
“How do you know?”

619
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,890
“They kiss each other quite a lot."

620
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,319
I said, “What is there?”

621
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,869
Any licentious society you find such kissing
going on.

622
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,940
For example if you go to France, I mean, it’s
horrifyingly kissing society, I tell you.

623
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,500
Everybody has a right to kiss everyone they
feel like.

624
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,079
I mean, it’s sometimes so much that you
really get frightened of the whole thing:

625
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,589
anybody can come and kiss you, anybody is
supposed to…

626
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,200
I mean, I don’t know how it works out but
it’s so.

627
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
So I said, “What is, so [great] in kissing?

628
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
There’s no love!”

629
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:57,990
Love is a thing which is not expressed in
that way, but which works, which flows.

630
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:03,200
It’s a power which acts, just like the sun’s
rays.

631
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,619
Sun’s rays come and act on the leaves.

632
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:13,299
In the same way the love flows and acts on
the Kundalini, and it gives Realisation to

633
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:14,299
others.

634
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,519
It transforms your life.

635
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,980
You become a different person altogether.

636
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,529
You become a master of yourself when you overpower
everything.

637
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:29,950
Of course some are, I would call them, lame
people, so they need little more time.

638
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,530
Some are very fast ones and some are so quick
that they once get it, they never lose it.

639
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:41,890
And then the real growth of the new personality
starts in which you start enjoying that bliss

640
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,089
which is promised.

641
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:46,690
All that is said before has to be proved today
— every thing.

642
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:55,410
Now like we went to one of the Protestant
Church meeting.

643
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,880
I mean Catholics and Protestants and all sorts
of things, you know!

644
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,130
I am facing, mullahs and priests and this
and that.

645
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,890
But these people they said, “We believe
in Christ."

646
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,890
I said, “Very good!

647
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,490
That’s a very good thing to do, is to believe
in Christ, thank God.

648
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:13,250
At least there is no anarchist or somebody
who is anti-Christ I am facing here!

649
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,320
But,” I said, “where is Christ?”

650
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
“He’s everywhere."

651
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,390
I said, “All right.

652
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,960
But how do you contact Him?”

653
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,500
Everywhere there is ether, everywhere there
are pictures, everywhere there is music, but

654
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,339
how do you get them in the television?

655
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,539
How do you contact?

656
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:37,450
He is placed in a centre within us and we
can prove it, through the Kundalini awakening,

657
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,230
that Christ is there.

658
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:44,460
Because when Kundalini reaches that centre,
the centre which is on the optic thalamus,

659
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,789
which controls the pituitary and the pineal
body, [that], in that centre, resides Christ

660
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:51,650
can be proved through Kundalini awakening.

661
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,150
Because when Kundalini arrives at that point
and it does not pierce, you have to take the

662
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,700
name of Christ and then Kundalini moves on.

663
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,099
But not the person who is not realised, the
one who is realised can only do it.

664
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:08,480
So there are two types of people you find
in Sahaja Yoga, is the people who are realised

665
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,579
and those who are not realised.

666
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:14,839
Now here the conflict starts that people who
are realised can shock other people because

667
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:16,319
they say some things very positively.

668
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,180
They say that, “See, this is wrong, you
should give up these things.

669
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,550
This is not going to lead you anywhere."

670
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,369
And they look just like as you are but they
know about your chakras.

671
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,280
And when they tell you, you get angry with
them and half of them leave, but that’s

672
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
not the way.

673
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,690
One should know that they are just trying
to help you.

674
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,339
They were just the same as you were.

675
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:41,690
Maybe even worse than you were or maybe much
worse than you were but today they have reached

676
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,980
the place from where they can feel you.

677
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,801
And you are also going to do the same, so
there is nothing to be shocked about or to

678
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:50,870
be angry with.

679
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:58,809
But there’s tremendous difference in any
artificial type of technique and the real

680
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,109
is this that they know what it is.

681
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:07,579
If you tie the eyes of ten people or ten young
people who are realised-souls, two are sitting

682
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,769
here, they all of them will say the same thing.

683
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:13,099
For example, if you ask them, where is this
gentleman catching?

684
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:17,450
They will show the same finger.

685
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:24,849
And this is such a subjective thing, such
a thing as your own, which has no whims, nothing.

686
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:26,539
It’s absolutely definite.

687
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:38,680
Now the last point which I would like to cover
today is that, as a result of Sahaja Yoga:

688
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,680
this is the chocolate on the castor oil, we
can say.

689
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,960
The advantage of Sahaja Yoga is felt immediately,
immediately.

690
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:57,549
First of all physical ailments get cured.

691
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:08,720
Now for your information I may have to say
this that in ten minutes Sahaja Yoga cured

692
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,880
the cancer of our President Sanjeev Reddy
in India; in ten minutes.

693
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,180
Cancer cannot be cured by anything else but
Sahaja Yoga – it’s a fact.

694
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:29,490
For example, now doctors have reached the
stage to say that cancer is caused by some

695
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:36,090
protein matter which attacks us from the areas
which are within us, which are built within

696
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,450
us since the Creation.

697
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:44,660
Now within us what are these areas, let us
see.

698
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:54,150
On the left hand side of this Ida Nadi or
this blue line is the collective subconscious.

699
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:03,609
On the right hand side of this yellow line
which is called as the Pingala Nadi is the

700
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:05,609
collective supra-conscious.

701
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:09,349
Below is the Hell.

702
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:15,480
On top is the super-consciousness which we
call as Self-realisation because this is the

703
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,369
seat of the Spirit, which is manifested in
the heart.

704
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,549
These are the areas, of course doctors don’t
know.

705
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:29,819
But whatever the psychologists start talking
like blind people can be easily seen through

706
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,940
when the lights are on.

707
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,869
For example, from the left side and the right
side I have always said there are entities

708
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:38,869
which attack you.

709
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:44,390
Those who disappeared in the Creation went
out of circulation because they were not good

710
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:47,029
for our evolution, they all exist there.

711
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:52,539
Say, there are some vegetables which form
viruses, there are some birds, some animals

712
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,670
and many human beings who exist on both the
sides.

713
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,559
On the right hand side are the people who
are very ambitious, who dealt with material

714
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,849
things and who try to overpower matter and
tried all kinds of tricks.

715
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:11,950
These are the people who are still there existing
within us.

716
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:18,240
When we try to go to the extremes, either
to the left or to the right, by any one of

717
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,559
these techniques, we get caught up.

718
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:27,140
And when this thing happens, these proteins,
so-called ’58 protein’ and number some

719
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,430
sort of 56, all these are nothing but they
are entities.

720
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,569
They attack us and they trigger the cancer
within us.

721
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:40,539
And once this is triggered there is no way
out because once you are in these areas, you’ll

722
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:47,500
be attacked more and more, and the galloping
state is established.

723
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,349
For example, now let us take the case of blood
cancer: a simple thing like blood cancer.

724
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,430
It’s the most simple thing and is very simple
to treat also.

725
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,259
[Dr.] David Spiro is laughing at it!

726
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:05,099
All right, how you get it?

727
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,080
The spleen is the speedometer within us, spleen
which is placed on the left hand side like

728
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,750
a round ball.

729
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:18,310
(No, on top a little bit.

730
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:25,960
David can you come and show them?

731
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,140
Yes, correct!

732
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,190
We should put it in the Void only, so it’s
better!

733
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,309
Near the Void you can say.)

734
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:43,329
Now spleen is managed by Swadhishthan Chakra,
which moves round and round the Void, you

735
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:44,329
see.

736
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:49,160
And it is the one which really sets our speed
and pace: both things are done by the Swadhishthana

737
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Chakra.

738
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,869
But this poor spleen is creating blood cells
for us.

739
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:01,220
First of all if you think too much then the
Swadhishthana Chakra has to convert the fat

740
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:07,569
cells for the use of the brain and it neglects
the spleen, the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys

741
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:08,569
and the uterus.

742
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:15,210
But when it neglects the spleen, this is the
first cause [of blood cancer], the primal

743
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,579
cause we can call it.

744
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,190
Secondly, those people who are supposed to
be very speedy — those who think too much

745
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,980
are speedy people also.

746
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:31,540
They will eat their food with such a speed,
I can tell you, that I have seen people that

747
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,543
they can polish off things before…I mean,
you see them there, and it’s finished! (laughter)

748
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:43,599
They are so fast, and if I am sitting with
them, I am really starving because I just

749
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,130
can’t keep pace with them!

750
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,190
Just you serve them, and it’s finished,
it’s polished off!

751
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:53,599
Then they will eat with that speed and immediately
finishing that plate there and they run off

752
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,599
for some other work.

753
00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,609
Now this poor spleen has to now create blood
for the digestion, then suddenly the fellow

754
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:05,089
runs out [so] it has to give the blood cells
for it’s running.

755
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:08,690
Then he sits down and he starts thinking.

756
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,500
While running he is thinking.

757
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,109
He is doing many things.

758
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:17,610
We think our body is a multipurpose machine.

759
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:21,640
So with one thing we will be brushing, with
another thing we will be doing something else,

760
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,089
with ears we will be doing something else,
with nose we will be doing something else,

761
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:27,940
with stomach we will be doing something else.

762
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:33,549
Like that, the whole body is poor thing busy
with multipurpose things: poor this body.

763
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,440
And then this spleen becomes really mad!

764
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,339
It goes bizarre, as you call it.

765
00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:42,369
It does not know what is wrong with the fellow.

766
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:48,230
It does not know when it will jump and when
it will go into some sort of a new activity.

767
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:55,769
So it goes really bizarre, and then the cells
that are created by it become malignant cells,

768
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:59,160
and blood cancer is settled.

769
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:06,680
But the third thing that really, that really,
attacks it is one of these entities catching

770
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,450
hold of these blood cells, and blood cancer
is set in.

771
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,190
And blood cancer can be very easily cured.

772
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,230
I have seen now three cases, where doctors
predicted that the patient is going to die

773
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:24,630
within fifteen days, is still surviving after
three years, quite hale and hearty!

774
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:31,420
If you just pull your attention through Kundalini
awakening and pierce it through here, the

775
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,900
attention which is spread out on left and
right and gone to the extreme like this, stretched,

776
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:45,109
can be pushed out onto the super-consciousness,
immediately all your attacks are finished.

777
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:50,340
All of them are left high and dry in their
own places, and you are cured.

778
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:55,299
And that is how blood cancer can be cured
very easily in Sahaja Yoga.

779
00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:00,190
But that doesn’t mean you think of all the
blood cancer patients you have and bring them

780
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,190
along here!

781
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,359
That always happens.

782
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:03,930
I would request you not to do that.

783
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,039
You see, this happened at the time of Christ
and it should not be repeated again.

784
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:13,070
God is interested in curing people who are
seekers, who are seeking God and not curing

785
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,940
people who are not seeking.

786
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,539
You do not look after a lamp which never is
going to be enlightened; you just throw it

787
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:19,640
in the junk!

788
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,270
In the same way those who are seekers get
their Realisation and get their cancer, all

789
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,990
kinds of incurable diseases, diabetes this,
that, lots of things, are cured.

790
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,849
I mean [the list is] endless.

791
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:34,190
So this is the first thing that happens: is
physical.

792
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:39,670
Then mental: you know there are some people
who are here sitting today who were horribly

793
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,420
epileptic.

794
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,359
Some of them used to scream for three hours,
thanks to some great gurus who have managed

795
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,250
to polish off everything that they had.

796
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,829
Who have managed to take away all their money,
mesmerise them completely.

797
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:57,029
And those who became epileptic falling on
the street, even some of the children, who

798
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:02,930
are here now today, who have been absolutely
cured of epilepsy, madness, schizophrenia,

799
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:08,799
all sort of diseases like that, because again
the same thing happens to you that your attention

800
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:13,900
goes into the super-consciousness, which is,
collective consciousness.

801
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,299
Collective consciousness gets enlightened
within you, it becomes actualised.

802
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,529
It gets manifesting itself.

803
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:24,549
It’s such a wonderful instrument you are
— a human being.

804
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:25,549
You have no idea.

805
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:27,790
Only thing is you have to be plugged to the
mains.

806
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:33,589
Like a television set, once it is plugged
to the mains, it starts manifesting, you also

807
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:35,009
start manifesting.

808
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:36,720
Nothing that I do, I do not do anything.

809
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,539
Actually really, it is something like everything
is ready, and one enlightened light can enlighten

810
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:43,880
another light!

811
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
What is there to be done?

812
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,480
You are just ready and you just receive your
own powers.

813
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,650
I don’t do anything.

814
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,660
And why should one feel so hurt if I am doing
it?

815
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,240
It’s something surprising.

816
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,950
Because a gentleman very seriously asked me,
“Why you?”

817
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:55,950
He was a doctor.

818
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,160
I said, “Doctor, I will be thankful you
come in my place.

819
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,150
Here I am, I have to work till two o’clock
in the night.

820
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,369
I have to work so very hard, such a thankless
job.

821
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,369
You better do it!

822
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,369
I’ll be very happy to be your disciple!

823
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:08,960
And whatever you say, I am willing to do.

824
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,200
You awaken the Kundalini of people!”

825
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,299
He said, “But I cannot."

826
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:15,830
So I said, “That’s why I am here!”

827
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,499
Unluckily I know this!

828
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:19,569
Unfortunately I know it!

829
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,960
Now what to do?

830
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,500
That I am supposed to do.

831
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,950
Now you are supposed to do many things which
I cannot do.

832
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,930
For example you can drive a car; I don’t
know anything about it.

833
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,369
I don’t understand your economics, I don’t
understand your laws, I cannot understand

834
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:36,190
anything that is supposed to be understood
by a normal human being.

835
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,990
But I understand Kundalini.

836
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,700
If you ask me to open an ordinary packet of
milk, I cannot!

837
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,880
But I can open Kundalini.

838
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,990
What to do now?

839
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,320
I know that, so why should you feel so hurt
about it?

840
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,400
It’s me who was supposed to do it.

841
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,670
And that’s the only problem, if you can
overcome it.

842
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:58,550
You know so many things and I don’t know
so many things, then there won’t be any

843
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,789
problem of ego coming in between.

844
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:06,880
If I have to, say, do something, fixing up
this, I’ll have to ask Douglas to do it.

845
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,720
I do not know how to fix it.

846
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,440
I may spoil it but I do not know how to use
it.

847
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,579
So this is what it is, as simple as that.

848
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,079
And this has to be done.

849
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,609
It was all promised.

850
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:18,900
I have to do it.

851
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,690
All this time has been promised.

852
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,190
All this happening has been promised.

853
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,960
This is your right to get it.

854
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,460
You’d better get it.

855
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,530
And you cannot pay for it; no question [of
that].

856
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,320
It’s an insult.

857
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,329
It is love.

858
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:34,329
It’s not mercenary.

859
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:35,329
It is love.

860
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,300
You cannot pay for it.

861
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,460
You cannot purchase me.

862
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,950
I am quite an illusion also.

863
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:45,950
I mean, I can be quite tricky so be careful
about me.

864
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:51,910
If you try to avoid me, I’ll avoid you hundred
times, and you’ll go out of circulation.

865
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,299
So be careful, because I am not that simple
as I look.

866
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:57,299
I am telling you beforehand, so be careful
about it.

867
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:04,360
But still you will forget because I look so
simple, but I am not.

868
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:13,099
I know so many things about you that I may
try to just avoid you and I may really get

869
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:16,720
you out of circulation for some time, till
I have really sincere good people in here

870
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:23,349
who get their Realisation, and then later
on we can try these people who have gone out

871
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:24,349
of circulation.

872
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:25,650
It works out that way.

873
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,250
Many of time Sahaja yogis think that we have
very few people coming to Sahaja Yoga.

874
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,599
I said, “That has to be because this is
real work."

875
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,369
This is not that you become an organisation
member of somebody and you are certified,

876
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,799
“All right, you are a Sahaja yogi."

877
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:38,819
There is nothing like that.

878
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:39,940
It has to happen.

879
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,160
The Kundalini has to come.

880
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,519
You have to feel the vibrations.

881
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:44,519
It is a happening.

882
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:45,519
Unless and until it happens you cannot give
false certificate.

883
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:48,210
It’s not like plastic flowers, it is a real
flower.

884
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:53,839
And for the real flower to come in, it takes
time, doesn’t matter.

885
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,930
I mean we cannot give a false certificate.

886
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,420
So the second thing that happens is emotional
thing.

887
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,920
Third thing is spiritual.

888
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,910
We can say that spiritually you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

889
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,040
You understand what mistakes you have committed,
what wrong people you have been to.

890
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,859
Immediately you understand.

891
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:15,280
You find it out.

892
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,380
And also you are told each and every secret:
how to do it, how to raise the Kundalini.

893
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,380
You can raise Kundalini.

894
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,490
Only if the Kundalini has crossed up to Agnya,
you can raise the Kundalini.

895
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:32,700
As soon as you get your Realisation, you can
give Realisation to others because of [the]

896
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:38,490
emergency: we have to give Realisation to
thousands and thousands and millions and millions.

897
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,339
You can give Realisation to people.

898
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:43,670
There are all these people have given Realisation.

899
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,849
Not only that, you can cure people.

900
00:58:46,849 --> 00:58:54,720
And you can know as to how you are progressing:
where you are, what are the chakras, where

901
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,890
they are placed on your fingers, where they
come, every thing you can know.

902
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,529
It’s all inside not outside.

903
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:04,280
And it should happen to all of you.

904
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,440
After all I am here only for that job.

905
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,920
I’ll work very hard, and I have been working
very hard, everyone knows that.

906
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,049
But you have to also understand to co-operate
a little bit.

907
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:17,049
Take your Realisation.

908
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:20,450
After Realisation you will have to work hard
also.

909
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:24,460
But before Realisation just leave it to people
who are realised.

910
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,349
Like, when you don’t know swimming, it’s
better to leave it to people who know swimming.

911
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:30,530
Once you learn swimming, you also teach others.

912
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,250
There’s nothing like inferiority, superiority,
and all that.

913
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,270
It’s not that.

914
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:40,589
So just face it as simple people, not with
all this misidentification with ego.

915
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:44,630
Now somebody was raising the Kundalini like
that, so one gentleman walked off, I said,

916
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:45,630
“Why?”

917
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,630
He said, “Why is he doing like this?”

918
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,630
I said, “But you do not know."

919
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,359
Supposing there is a person who is trying
to help you swimming, he puts his hand under

920
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:55,430
your belly: you can get angry with that person,
“Why are you doing that?”

921
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,630
I mean, he’s making you to float.

922
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,289
But this is what it is.

923
00:59:58,289 --> 01:00:01,180
You do not know the technique which these
people know.

924
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:06,080
You will also know the technique of Kundalini,
which is a living technique, because you are

925
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
not yet living.

926
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,162
When you become realised, you will be knowing
because the power will flow from your hand.

927
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:15,039
You can feel it on your hands, the cool breeze
flowing.

928
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:23,329
But there’s only one warning to all our
western seekers, which I always give: that

929
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:27,980
you are great saints, I know you are seekers,
you are very genuine and you are honest, everything

930
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
is there.

931
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,359
But you have one defect is that you think
about everything.

932
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,109
Even you have organised God, you have organised
about Him.

933
01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:42,839
You have already preconceived ideas about
Him — all this is there.

934
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,249
And anybody who tries to play some tricks
with you, you are very happy with that person

935
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:49,099
and you are going along with that person very
nicely.

936
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:54,559
But here it is you who has to know, it is
you who has to achieve, it is you who has

937
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,559
to judge.

938
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,029
Nobody is going to say that you are all right
unless and until you say you are all right.

939
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:01,510
It is you who have to believe into it.

940
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:06,980
So what happens that after Realisation the
Kundalini rises and She pierces this fontanel

941
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,150
bone area where you get your baptism.

942
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:13,690
You can even feel the cool breeze coming from
your head, actually you can feel it.

943
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,890
But then you forget the experience, you go
home and start thinking about it.

944
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,651
As soon as you start thinking, the whole thing
comes down, because it is beyond thinking.

945
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:25,500
The happening is beyond thinking: without
thinking it has happened.

946
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,359
By thinking Kundalini doesn’t rise.

947
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:30,980
So just allow it to work out.

948
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,039
When it works out, you will be surprised [that]
it’s flowing.

949
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:38,809
Supposing there is electricity coming and
the electricity comes in, you see the light

950
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:39,809
flickering.

951
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:43,910
If you start thinking about it, do you think
you’ll get back the light?

952
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,910
No!

953
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,900
You have to put the connection right.

954
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,680
It’s something like that.

955
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,779
So thinking gives you ramblings, people are
lost [in that].

956
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:53,779
Then they come back.

957
01:01:53,779 --> 01:01:58,300
And once, after Realisation if you lose it,
it takes time, it takes time.

958
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,950
It’s a headache to me and headache to you.

959
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,019
Many people do that way but please don’t
do it.

960
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,039
After all you are seekers of ages.

961
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,630
Why should you waste your energy and time
and mine also.

962
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:13,910
Be sensible and wise, get your Realisation
and get to it.

963
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,849
Give up all your misidentifications.

964
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:17,410
All these are misidentifications.

965
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:22,779
And do not reach that point where you become
helpless and you have to give up these misidentifications.

966
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:28,130
Because I told one person I told that, “Your
guru is not all right,” and he wouldn’t

967
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,069
believe me, because his Void was catching.

968
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:33,099
Then he got epileptic, he got sick, then he
came to me.

969
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:35,489
It took me three months to work on him.

970
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:41,259
So the whole process of emancipation is slowed
down, and that’s how you pull down the forces

971
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,259
of Divinity.

972
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,970
There are so many things one can say.

973
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:49,249
As you know there are lectures and lectures,
and Douglas has so many tapes and in London

974
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:51,109
itself I have done so much.

975
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:57,019
And to understand why London and why England,
you better read “Milton” by William Blake.

976
01:02:57,019 --> 01:03:03,309
He has prophesied all this that is going to
happen.

977
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:06,359
That England is going to be the Jerusalem.

978
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:10,609
That it is going to be the pilgrimage.

979
01:03:10,609 --> 01:03:13,089
It has described everything that is Sahaja
Yoga.

980
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:16,670
It’s a wonderful prophesy, you better read
it to understand.

981
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,160
It is even described where the ashram would
be in Lambeth Vale.

982
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:27,369
It has described that first it will start
in Surrey Hills where I first came and stayed.

983
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:31,934
And he has described in the end how the Virgin
Herself is going to work it out, how the Mother

984
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,180
is going to work it.

985
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,380
It’s all beautifully done.

986
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,259
So you had such a great poet like Blake, who
has already guided you.

987
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:41,150
Better take guidance from them.

988
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,720
Another is Shakespeare who was another great
realised-soul who showed the futility of nonsense

989
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,749
of this so-called romanticism and all this.

990
01:03:49,749 --> 01:03:52,480
So be sensible about it, be wise.

991
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,770
You have a great heritage.

992
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:57,670
Your Stonehenge and all these things, I have
talked about it, what are these.

993
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:01,720
This place has been worked out by many saints
before, and today you are born here.

994
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,059
You are here to achieve your highest.

995
01:04:04,059 --> 01:04:06,599
There is a purpose behind it.

996
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:13,960
As I said that England is the heart of the
universe, no doubt, it is the heart, that’s

997
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
why I am here.

998
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,510
I didn’t come as an immigrant or anything.

999
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,299
I came because my husband got elected to this
post and I came here.

1000
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:21,390
That was all organised.

1001
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,710
And I am just there because of that, and you’ll
be happy to know he has been re-elected again

1002
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:29,829
for five years so I am going to be here five
years more.

1003
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:35,000
And then England being the heart, we have
to be very careful because everything articulates

1004
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,140
through heart, and the Spirit lives in the
heart.

1005
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:44,460
England is the heart, India is the Kundalini
and Europe is the liver.

1006
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:51,530
Now see the contradiction: Kundalini, where
Kundalini is in India people are sleeping.

1007
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:55,819
Kundalini is sleeping; where Europe, where
the liver is, where the attention is, people

1008
01:04:55,819 --> 01:05:00,890
are drunkards, they are drinking, the liver
is gone!

1009
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,940
Where the heart is England, it is lethargic.

1010
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,250
Tell me now: what am I to do?

1011
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:12,279
This is the situation in which we are, so
we have to rise to the occasion and achieve

1012
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,279
our goal.

1013
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:17,829
England is very important, very, very important,
and I am going to work very hard here, no

1014
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:18,829
doubt.

1015
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:26,599
But you all have to help me and understand
that the time has come now to get what you

1016
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:27,910
have been seeking.

1017
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:36,180
All of you should achieve what you have been
seeking, right now.

1018
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:41,720
May God Bless you.

1019
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,849
I would like you to ask me some questions.

1020
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:47,779
But don’t ask controversial questions like:
“I read in this book, that book…”

1021
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:51,849
Then somebody has been to some far-fetched
place, “What do you think of this guru and

1022
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:52,849
that guru?”

1023
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:53,849
I am not going to get into controversies.

1024
01:05:53,849 --> 01:06:03,190
So don’t ask me about any guru, you will
find out yourself.

1025
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,940
Ask some sensible questions about Realisation.

1026
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:23,660
Seeker: If you feel yourself to be completely
blocked, if there’s nothing you can do.

1027
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:28,119
What do you do?

1028
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:36,019
Shri Mataji: You leave it to me.

1029
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:38,380
I am quite a master in this.

1030
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,470
I have had all kinds of blocks: mountains
after mountains.

1031
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,489
You don’t know how much I have gone through.

1032
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:44,930
I have become now an expert.

1033
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:54,609
You are not such a block, at least as far
as you are concerned, so don’t worry.

1034
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:56,819
You see, I have worked hard for years to study
all the permutations, combinations.

1035
01:06:56,819 --> 01:07:03,260
I used to enter into the Kundalini and into
the…to find out what are the blockages.

1036
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,080
And I know how to find the way out.

1037
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,849
You just leave it to me.

1038
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:14,150
But later on when you get it, everything I
will tell you, every secret about it.

1039
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,569
Everything I am going to tell you, and you
are going to become the master yourself.

1040
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:22,309
That’s what it is.

1041
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:26,230
What kind of blockage you are fearing?

1042
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:31,249
Seeker: Some kind of fear.

1043
01:07:31,249 --> 01:07:39,289
Shri Mataji: Fear is very simple to conquer.

1044
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:43,910
You see, it is because of conditionings.

1045
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:49,119
People are … I don’t know why they do
it, this I cannot explain.

1046
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,579
Human beings are very difficult.

1047
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,789
Like in France they said, “Mother, if you
say you are a happy person, they’ll think

1048
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:55,789
you are naïve."

1049
01:07:55,789 --> 01:07:56,789
I said, “Why?”

1050
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:59,220
“Because [they think] you do not know any
problems.

1051
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,880
So you have to be a very unhappy person.

1052
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,190
You have to show you are unhappy.

1053
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:06,720
Your cheeks must go inside like this; you
must look absolutely like a prisoner of Ceylon."

1054
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,720
I said, “Really?”

1055
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,779
They said, “If you go like this, Mother,
in such a happy mood, they will never take

1056
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:13,779
you seriously!”

1057
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:16,720
I said, “But I don’t think."

1058
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,180
They said, “We must suffer.

1059
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,150
That’s what they want."

1060
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:23,100
I said, “But why?

1061
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,310
Christ has suffered for you, now why do you
want to suffer?”

1062
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,310
But they say these things.

1063
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,290
Actually you know, it is with these people
I have seen they say.

1064
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:37,240
I said, “If it is so, you are people having
prostitutes on the streets, lined up together.

1065
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,930
You have pubs on the other side.

1066
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,522
You have gay, this thing and nonsensical things
all over.

1067
01:08:42,522 --> 01:08:43,522
You are unhappy.

1068
01:08:43,522 --> 01:08:47,260
You are making everybody extremely unhappy."

1069
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:51,770
I said, “I am unhappy because I see this
kind of thing going on here, and you are saying

1070
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,770
that you are unhappy.

1071
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:56,250
You are not unhappy at all, you are just escaping
it."

1072
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,650
Also so the fear is another sort of a conditioning
on you.

1073
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:05,380
It comes to you [such] that you think, “I
will have to lose something."

1074
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:08,710
No, you blossom into something.

1075
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,000
Because you are beautiful.

1076
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,590
I see that beauty and I see that Spirit and
you are that.

1077
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:22,010
And the fear that you have is because you
cannot see it.

1078
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,010
It’s just a conditioning.

1079
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,010
You just blossom into it.

1080
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:26,640
Did you read any one of these horrible books
on Kundalini?

1081
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
That’s it!

1082
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,650
That’s very simple to overcome.

1083
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:33,960
I’ll tell you what: a villager comes to
the city, he has never seen electricity and

1084
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,010
he puts his two fingers in the plug!

1085
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,010
[It’s] like that.

1086
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,010
They are absolutely unauthorised.

1087
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,310
You know, they do not know what Kundalini
is.

1088
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,270
I was amazed.

1089
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:46,750
There’s a big book like that, and he says
the Kundalini is in the stomach!

1090
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,990
I said, “Now what to do?”

1091
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,280
And he’s written a big book like that, you
see.

1092
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,600
They are naïve first of all, they are unauthorised,
they are unholy.

1093
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,610
Everybody cannot do Kundalini’s job.

1094
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:02,460
You have to be an authorised person from God
and you have to be holy person.

1095
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,140
Specially a gentleman, I know, who has written
a book, he leads such a horrible private life.

1096
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,890
He’s such a money-minded fellow.

1097
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,170
He talks of Kundalini, I was surprised.

1098
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:18,840
He’s taking money from everyone and he’s
leading such a horrible life and he’s spoiling

1099
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,200
women and doing all kinds of things and raping
them.

1100
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,650
And he is telling that my Kundalini rose and
it troubled me like this, and it will.

1101
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:30,210
Kundalini doesn’t trouble actually [it’s]
this Deity sitting there on the first chakra

1102
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:31,230
– Shri Ganesha.

1103
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:35,960
He is the Deity of innocence, who incarnated
as Jesus Christ.

1104
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,410
He only thrashes such people who try to handle
Kundalini.

1105
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:49,280
Even they try to put your innocence, which
looks after your sex onto the Mother.

1106
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:54,700
Just imagine what a sinful thing it is.

1107
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,720
Innocence is the one that is your special
power.

1108
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,270
That’s why people are not even spontaneous
now in sex.

1109
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,900
They just think about it.

1110
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:17,390
Do you know the latest numbers of people who
are impotent in the West?

1111
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:24,250
And do you know, in Switzerland itself, out
of five families only one family can produce

1112
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,470
children – they are impotent.

1113
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:31,610
If you think about sex, you can become impotent.

1114
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:36,450
All the spontaneity is lost.

1115
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,710
And here people are getting sophisticated
with it.

1116
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:46,050
Either you become a rapist or you become absolutely
an impotent person.

1117
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:51,120
Either you go the right or to the left.

1118
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:59,680
So these people who talk about Kundalini have
no sense of proportion, they have lead a very

1119
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,300
bad life, they are unholy people.

1120
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,980
They have no sense of holiness, righteousness.

1121
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,090
I mean righteousness is the thing.

1122
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:11,020
When I talk of righteousness they think I
am a Victorian, you see.

1123
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:17,430
So I said, “I am not only Victorian, I am
even much earlier – I am ancient."

1124
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,920
But that is what it is.

1125
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,340
But I do not say you become righteous or anything
— nothing out of the kind — because that’s

1126
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,810
a difficult task.

1127
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:28,320
What I say you is you get your Realisation.

1128
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,730
[Then] automatically you will do it, automatically.

1129
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:33,350
Because the religion, what we call is the
religion or the righteousness gets enlightened

1130
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,140
within you, [so] you just cannot do it.

1131
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,650
So I am not going to tell you.

1132
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,890
I said I am tricky.

1133
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,220
I will just raise your Kundalini.

1134
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,890
You yourself will give up.

1135
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,410
I don’t say you give up your drugs, nothing,
but you just give up.

1136
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,860
I don’t say you give up your drinks.

1137
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,330
I do not say you give up your cigarettes.

1138
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:54,550
There are many who have given up completely
because they have found the absolute!

1139
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,690
All right?

1140
01:12:55,690 --> 01:13:00,550
In the same way your fears will also disappear
but do not think of them.

1141
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,040
Just now you are sitting before a very powerful
person.

1142
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,580
Don’t you worry.

1143
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,730
Alright?

1144
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:10,320
Is there any question?

1145
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,710
One more, and then I will do the thing.

1146
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,970
Anyone?

1147
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:30,650
Seeker: Mother, Mother, you mentioned about
emergency, what did you mean?

1148
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:39,770
Shri Mataji: Are you already frightened?

1149
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,600
I said ‘emergency’ because the Last Judgment
has started.

1150
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,300
In the atmosphere it is.

1151
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,740
No earthquakes for you, all right?

1152
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:57,800
Can’t you see [that] there is emergency,
people want to have it, and you can feel the

1153
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,050
emergency, everywhere there’s a talk about
it.

1154
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:05,140
Everyone knows there is some sort of an atmosphere
of emergency.

1155
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,620
Everybody is running fast, nobody knows why.

1156
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:17,020
You don’t worry, you are a realised-soul.

1157
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:27,210
Emergency is that you give more Realisation
to East End (of London) people! (laughing)

1158
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,600
All right?

1159
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,550
So, anymore, no, all right.

1160
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:52,540
Now, why I have asked you to ask questions,
that after this don’t ask any questions,

1161
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:53,930
just have it.

1162
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,670
If you are hungry, you will just get it.

1163
01:14:55,670 --> 01:15:05,540
And I would request you to put out your shoes
and put your feet on the ground.

1164
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,951
I don’t need really but I am just doing
it to please you people.

1165
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:09,951
It’s all right, I can manage.

1166
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:15,760
Because they will say, “Why don’t You
take out your shoes?” you know.

1167
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,480
All right, so, put your hands towards me,
straight like this, and you have to close

1168
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,480
your eyes.

1169
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,410
That’s very important, that you must close
your eyes.

1170
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:27,550
Now, why?

1171
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:32,030
Because the Kundalini when it rises above
the Agnya, if your eyes are not closed, it

1172
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:37,290
does not rise because there is dilatation
of the pupil that takes place, and it stops

1173
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,980
there.

1174
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,590
But maybe your eyes may be flickering possibly,
then you open your eyes and watch me.

1175
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:48,570
In case that they are not flickering, then
it’s all right.

1176
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:53,020
Now some of you may feel a little heat, and
if Sahaja yogis tell you something, you just

1177
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,020
listen to them, don’t get angry with them.

1178
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,020
It’s for your good.

1179
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:03,040
If they tell you to remove something or do
something, it’s better to listen to them.

1180
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:13,280
Just put both your hands towards me.

1181
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,870
Just like that.

1182
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:28,460
Just see if there is flickering in your eyes.

1183
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:43,890
It’s a funny thing today: the centre you
are catching is Left Nabhi.

1184
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:54,030
And you have to decide one thing that you
have to marry sometime because there are great

1185
01:16:54,030 --> 01:17:11,020
souls who are to be born, and we have to give
them parents who are realised-souls.

1186
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:18,220
If you are not yet married just say that,
“Mother, we’ll marry,” that’s all.

1187
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:21,560
It will work out.

1188
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:33,700
Still Left Nabhi is there.

1189
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:39,601
Also the marriage institution has to be put
right because, if these great souls are to

1190
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:44,590
be born, we have to give them a nest, a family
where they are to be born.

1191
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:50,670
Otherwise poor Indians will have to bear all
the children of the world!

1192
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:58,330
Because of this emergency many people are
taking birth, and they would not like to be

1193
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:03,510
born in a place where the parents are killing
the children or where the parents are quarrelling

1194
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:05,690
among themselves and every day they are having
a divorce.

1195
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:10,830
So poor Indians they have to take the load
upon themselves.

1196
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:17,760
Marcus close your eyes.

1197
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:24,700
Close your eyes Linda.

1198
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:29,900
Close your eyes.

1199
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:40,300
It doesn’t go over your Hamsa.

1200
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:45,510
Close your eyes.

1201
01:18:45,510 --> 01:19:22,650
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

1202
01:19:22,650 --> 01:20:35,710
Void is there and Left Nabhi.
