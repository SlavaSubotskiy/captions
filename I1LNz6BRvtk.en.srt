1
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:30,546
Shri Mataji: Be seated.

2
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:57,587
What’s that?
Yogi: Little Ganeshas, Mother.

3
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:03,707
Yogi 2: Little Ganeshas. The gift.
Shri Mataji: Can you lift this? Ah?

4
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,868
Please be seated.

5
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:11,290
What is shaking?
Yogi: I think, it’s the stage.

6
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:16,028
Shri Mataji: What’s shaking here?
Yogi: It's the stage, Shri Mataji, I think.

7
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,663
Shri Mataji: Is the energy?! Yogi: I think,
it’s me moving. Shri Mataji: Eh?

8
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:24,238
Yogi: I think, it’s the stage.
Shri Mataji: Yeah…

9
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:59,714
It was very beautiful of [the] children
to come and receive Me

10
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:04,292
in this beautiful manner.

11
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:11,855
It can take you back to the days of Krishna

12
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:21,452
when, in His childhood, He was very much
respected by His friends

13
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:29,841
and they tried to do all the honour
that was possible.

14
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:34,402
You know the story of His birth.

15
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,780
Also you know the story –

16
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:44,738
[I think if you stop the water then -
otherwise, My speech might be little bit…]

17
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,129
You know the story of His birth.

18
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,163
And here we have the flowing of water,
both the sides.

19
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:07,556
The way He used to play His flute,
along the Yamuna River.

20
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:16,359
The whole thing looks, sometimes, so human,
but it is not.

21
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,610
And, at the right time, whenever He needed,
as a child, He manifested His powers:

22
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:31,212
that He killed a woman who was a devil

23
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:35,257
[and] ultimately He killed Kansa.

24
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:44,950
After that you know that He preached Gita,

25
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,894
but it’s not so fast as that.

26
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:55,911
After killing Kansa, He went down
to Dwarika to rule there.

27
00:09:56,768 --> 00:10:03,165
And there He had to marry five more wives.

28
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:09,085
First He had sixteen thousand wives.
So then many people can ask a question,

29
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:13,360
“Mother, what sort of a husband
He must be?”

30
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:22,954
These sixteen thousand should explain
that He has sixteen petals

31
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:33,219
on His domain of Vishuddhi chakra

32
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:42,884
and theses sixteen petals, multiplied
by the one thousand petals

33
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,853
of the Sahastrara become sixteen thousand.

34
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:54,876
So these are sixteen thousand powers,
which are available to us also.

35
00:10:55,483 --> 00:11:03,099
These sixteen thousand powers are working
in the brain.

36
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:11,187
These powers could not come
as Sahaja Yogis,

37
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:15,258
so they came as women

38
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:20,491
who were entrapped by a king – exactly
sixteen thousand –

39
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:28,737
and He married them because by marriage,
it was all very dharmic.

40
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:36,509
Also He married five wives later, who
represented the five elements.

41
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:47,956
[An] Incarnation cannot be understood
from human angle –

42
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,620
can never be understood, I should say –

43
00:11:53,837 --> 00:12:00,756
because their ways and methods
are different.

44
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:04,900
They have ways and methods of their own

45
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:11,765
and they do not expose them to other
people.

46
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:18,408
Not that they are afraid to expose
or they don’t want to expose,

47
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:25,623
but it will not be intelligible, it cannot
be understood by human beings.

48
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,522
If you ask Me a question, say, “Mother,
how do you manage that?”

49
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,732
I may just change the topic very cleverly.

50
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:51,687
So now, I am going to tell you about
sixteen thousand petals of the Sahastrara

51
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:55,865
and now we can start the translation.

52
00:12:56,872 --> 00:13:00,091
[To the translator: “In gist you can
tell them.”]

53
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:56,550
So now, to understand the sixteen thousand
powers that you have got

54
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:02,147
in your brain, already manifesting:
As soon as you get your Realisation

55
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:08,933
those sixteen thousand powers start
manifesting.

56
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:35,786
Every petal of Sahastrara has got sixteen
powers.

57
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:55,370
And these are – I mean the petals -
are made of the five elements.

58
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:09,996
So these five elements, who create these
one thousand petals,

59
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,702
have got sixteen powers on every petal.

60
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:32,719
Now the five elements is the right side,

61
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:45,711
which is the content or, we can say,
the matter of the brain.

62
00:16:50,861 --> 00:17:01,147
The matter of the brain is created
in such a manner

63
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:05,190
that it has a protective matter also.

64
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,945
So we have grey matter and also

65
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:15,709
the white matter which is outside
to protect the grey matter.

66
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:40,004
Now these sixteen powers which are
expressed in every petal

67
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,607
are coming from the left side.

68
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:54,836
Shri Krishna is an Incarnation of the left
side.

69
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:04,669
So the sixteen powers which are coming
from the left side

70
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:13,938
adorn the petals which are made
of five elements.

71
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:29,320
But these powers already exist
in the brain.

72
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:44,344
By these five, plus sixteen, powers we do
all our nervous system work.

73
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:56,775
For example, if you have to lift your hand
like this,

74
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:05,889
then it is worked, first of all, through
the left side

75
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,417
which desires that it should be lifted.

76
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:26,512
And then is ordered to the five powers
or five elements: they go into the action.

77
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:36,539
Also we have in our system

78
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:47,026
a special type of arrangement where
there is a reflex action,

79
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:58,710
which is built earlier in our evolution.

80
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:12,506
So, in a human consciousness whatever
works is not a reflex action.

81
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:24,451
But now, when your Sahastrara is
enlightened with the Kundalini,

82
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:35,180
all these one thousand powers multiply it
into sixteen thousand.

83
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:45,673
So all the nerves in the body get
enlightenment.

84
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:53,416
Your attention becomes enlightened.

85
00:20:55,232 --> 00:21:03,585
With these one thousand dimensions you
become collectively conscious.

86
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:15,398
We can say like this: if there are sixteen
people staying in five houses

87
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:23,567
and they are working separately

88
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:27,212
and sometimes coordinating.

89
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,360
But [then] a flood comes in.

90
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,507
[Aside to the translator: “Flood, flood.”]

91
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:45,632
As a result of the flood all these houses
are brought together

92
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:53,137
and get enveloped into the energy
of that flood.

93
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:58,777
Then they join hands together.

94
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:04,244
They forget their houses

95
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:12,553
and they start using now a new energy
of collective consciousness.

96
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,593
This is exactly what has happened in you,

97
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:26,999
that as soon as the Kundalini has risen
within you and given you Realisation,

98
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:36,618
the flood has brought these dormant
energies in you into play.

99
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:49,881
You don’t have to think that you have
to hold each others’ hand

100
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:55,107
when there’s a flood, you just hold it
automatically, spontaneously.

101
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:08,822
So all the energies suddenly start getting
into motion.

102
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:21,518
So this power where the one thousand
energies of the brain

103
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:29,240
[are] suddenly awakened, is the power
called as Viratangana.

104
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:42,181
That is - she is the power of the Virat.

105
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:53,376
She is the power which makes Shri Krishna
a Virat.

106
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:06,962
So the sixteen thousand powers which
He achieves in your being

107
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:15,034
is done through the power of Viratangana.

108
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:25,761
And at these modern times you know
who is that.

109
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:33,940
So the Adi Shakti takes the form
of Viratangana.

110
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:46,358
With that enlightenment you achieve
your Realisation.

111
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:54,933
So the Kundalini passing through different
centres,

112
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:59,743
enlightening the different energies,
ultimately comes to the brain

113
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:04,691
and enlightens the Viratangana power.

114
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:21,081
At this point, at the brain point,
the Kundalini starts spreading in the head.

115
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:30,905
She, of course, shoots off from the
Sahastrara but also she trickles down

116
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:38,584
through this plate of the brain (medha)
downwards on the sympathetic.

117
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:52,969
That relaxes you. That’s why you feel
relaxed.

118
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,737
It relaxes the sympathetic.

119
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:02,876
That enlarges the centres.

120
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,807
It brings it back to its normal positions.

121
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:15,065
The enlargement of the parasympathetic,
or Sushumna,

122
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:20,230
makes the Kundalini rise in more quantum.

123
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:34,070
It is all done by a reflex action
of Kundalini.

124
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:40,615
So the Kundalini is already built in such
a manner that, when she rises,

125
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:45,669
she automatically does all these things.

126
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:56,624
So your Kundalini has got the power
to enlighten all your centres,

127
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:04,293
and to enlighten your brain, and
to relax you,

128
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:13,517
to increase the size of the centres, and
make the Kundalini rise again!

129
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:35,214
But the Kundalini has a very special power:

130
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:42,667
that every human being’s Kundalini
knows Me.

131
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:48,839
Many people who have just seen
My photograph

132
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,277
have got their Kundalini awakened.

133
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:03,918
But if your centres are very clouded,
or exhausted,

134
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:10,214
or jammed together, or separated away
from each other,

135
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:14,563
then the Kundalini stops there.

136
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:33,427
That’s why some people get Realisation
very fast and some take time.

137
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:43,509
These conditioned minds are the most
difficult.

138
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,832
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?
Yogi: I don’t know.

139
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:52,184
Shri Mataji: Is it touching each other?

140
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,328
Energy joined together.

141
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,990
Translator: But not in the central way.

142
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:15,719
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?

143
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:21,297
Yogi: OK? No.

144
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:34,100
Now the rising of the Kundalini is achieved
better in a place

145
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:45,995
which is frequented or visited
or lived into by saints,

146
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,781
also for people who are not so complicated.

147
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,669
For example, today only, I discovered

148
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,541
that the Catholic Church has complicated
your lives so much.

149
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:26,578
I did not know that they have been
preaching that sex is a sin.

150
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:41,245
Then, if that is so, that means only Adam
and Eve two would have lived on this Earth.

151
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:52,035
And these people were not with Adam and Eve
to know what they did!

152
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,034
And this absurd idea

153
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:07,655
was very much there also at the time
of Shri Krishna among Indians.

154
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:18,721
And as a result of that, we had ascetics
who were very hot-tempered.

155
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:31,909
They developed one-sided personality,
of say, a sun-like,

156
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:39,299
if they looked at somebody, they could just
burn him off – bhasma (ashes).

157
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:49,724
And such austerity they had that,
if you had to talk to them,

158
00:31:49,925 --> 00:32:01,491
you had to use at least a distant,
some pole, hollow pole -

159
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:08,450
such horrid people.

160
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,069
But Shri Krishna when He was born,

161
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,318
He found out this imbalance is being
created.

162
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:29,829
At the same time His cousin, whose name
was Neminath,

163
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:37,506
who was a Jain Tirthankara, developed
an aversion to meat eating.

164
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,743
(Aside to the translator: “Meat eating”).

165
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:56,092
As a result of that, another extreme nature
started,

166
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:04,263
and people thought that eating meat
is a sin.

167
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:12,191
All kinds of varieties of ‘sins’ started
prospering.

168
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:17,011
And they had brands [of sins]; this brand,
that brand.

169
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,818
As you have brands like Christian Dior,
this, that –

170
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:24,591
like that: this sin, this sin, this sin,
like that.

171
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:38,790
But underneath, they were very much
infatuated by sex.

172
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:52,741
They are the ones who started these
erotic temples in India – Jains.

173
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:04,317
Now the other side of it is that
the horrible Hindu ‘saints’ –

174
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,714
not saints I should say, what should we
call them? – ascetics,

175
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:13,984
and the terrible, these Jain people,
all put together,

176
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:20,785
formed a formidable idea about religion.

177
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:32,798
So Krishna took an Incarnation.

178
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:39,123
It was not only to kill Kansa

179
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:49,691
but to tell people that this kind of stupid
conditioning is not religion.

180
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:59,579
Religion can never be against the natural
laws.

181
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:12,133
But the ascend starts moving from a sex
which has no maryadas –

182
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:16,103
or in the lower animals it is even worse
than that –

183
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:21,196
going up to a point in human beings where
it has to have maryadas:

184
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:28,915
to be devoted to one person, and be
faithful to that person.

185
00:35:52,338 --> 00:36:03,976
And then He brought forth the religion
of natural maryadas.

186
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:18,252
You have to marry the person.

187
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:24,151
Translator: You have to marry. Shri Mataji:
Marry. You had to marry the person.

188
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:27,872
Marriage.

189
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:31,569
He gets nervous with the word!

190
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:44,717
Alright. Yes, people do get nervous!

191
00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:59,549
Now, He had married five wives and sixteen
more, sixteen thousand more.

192
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:06,570
So they challenged (Him), “What do you
say of one marriage with one person?

193
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:10,449
You already have so many wives!”

194
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:20,897
Then, I have told you already a story [of]
how He proved that He was a Yogeshwara.

195
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:30,190
He was beyond all these relationships.

196
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:41,633
And this shows that, for Yogeshwaras, it
does not matter how many times He married

197
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,538
or, for a Yogeshwari like Me, how many
children I have.

198
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:22,273
So the times – or what we call
the samayachar –

199
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:29,168
makes a person behave in a particular
manner which is an Incarnation.

200
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:46,640
There was a murder case for a man who was
following Hare Rama Hare Krishna [cult].

201
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:55,239
Of course, it was not established, but
he felt that, after all, he’s Krishna,

202
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,469
so he can kill people.

203
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,760
Now, Krishna was an Incarnation,

204
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:17,766
He knew whom to kill and how to kill.

205
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:25,229
He said that, “Nobody is living, now I’ve
already killed them.”

206
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:36,200
The discretion of an Incarnation is
perfect.

207
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:43,852
So one should not immediately think that
because an Incarnation has done like this,

208
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:46,885
so we can also do.

209
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:55,657
But human beings always take over.

210
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:04,674
That’s the stupidity part of all the human
beings, I must say.

211
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:13,524
Like the Christians, all of them believe
they must get crucified

212
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,849
and they must suffer.

213
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,509
Are you Christ?

214
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:28,771
By so many crucifixions of so many
stupid Christians

215
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:34,611
what are we going to achieve?

216
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:42,691
All sorts of complicated ideas come out
of all this kind of a nonsensical thing

217
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:49,659
just to say [that] there has to be gloom.

218
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:58,977
Like yesterday as I told you, is
a miserable people.

219
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,170
Christ crucified Himself so that your Agya
could be cleared

220
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:09,784
and that you enjoy life,

221
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:18,627
because Christ Himself was an Incarnation,

222
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:24,560
and whether you crucify Him or do not
crucify Him makes no difference to Him.

223
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:32,604
So the difference between the Incarnation
and a human being

224
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:38,034
is to be understood, first of all,
in Krishna’s life.

225
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:49,105
When it started raining heavily and when
Indra wanted

226
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:54,495
to put down Shri Krishna, the rains
were so strong.

227
00:41:54,696 --> 00:42:02,030
He just lifted one mountain, Govardhan,
on His one finger.

228
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:19,329
So the others, who were His followers,
His Gopas,

229
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:25,175
they also had some sticks with them,
so they also put some sticks, you see.

230
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,234
But they were children!

231
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:45,549
Now, I don’t understand the people who
are so grown up, who look grown up,

232
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:50,627
and behave worse than children!

233
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,516
Nature teaches us all the time.

234
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:06,224
See now, people are understanding that
whatever they have done,

235
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:09,254
as far as the marriage is concerned,
is a wrong thing

236
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:14,261
and now they are coming down to what
Shri Krishna had said.

237
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:30,839
Shri Mataji: What did you say?
Translator: As far as what is concerned.

238
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,114
Shri Mataji: Again marriage.
Translator: Marriage again!

239
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:42,842
It’s like a red rag [to a bull] to him!
And to many!

240
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:48,838
That’s also, I think, is this Catholic
Church.

241
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:57,624
But why did Christ attend a wedding?

242
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:04,163
I mean, this should be understood:
if He was against marriage

243
00:44:04,364 --> 00:44:11,106
why did He attend a wedding and also
made wine for them?

244
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:28,013
But they used that incident just because
they want to drink wine!

245
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:37,695
But even there, Christ was very careful,

246
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:42,376
what He did, He made water into wine,
in a second like that.

247
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:47,296
But to make an alcohol, you must
ferment it.

248
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:59,458
I can also do that, so what?

249
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:05,053
But I can’t make an alcohol, I‘ll have
to put some fungus into it.

250
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:19,981
So, this is what it is: how people have
made God or Incarnations into –

251
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:26,766
according to their small minds and
according to their selfish ends.

252
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:35,761
Because if you say that you are originally
a sinner,

253
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:39,208
then you say, “Now what do we do?”

254
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:47,232
“Now for atonement, you give lots
of money,”

255
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:54,326
and God doesn’t understand money –
what’s the use?

256
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:02,510
Is all wrong, absolutely wrong.

257
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:04,939
You have committed no sins.

258
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:09,987
These are all non-existent things
they are talking about.

259
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:16,555
But I've seen in the West, people would
say, “How can our Kundalini rise?

260
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:19,679
We are sinners."

261
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:29,539
Better give up all these conditionings.

262
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,553
Nobody is a sinner:

263
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:39,178
that’s what Shri Krishna said.

264
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:45,294
Of course, He divided people into three
categories, basically.

265
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:54,042
But He said that anybody can get
Self-realisation

266
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:59,141
and could be enlightened.

267
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:07,357
If He had believed that people are sinners
He would not have said this.

268
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:17,979
This is absolutely anti-God and anti-Christ
and anti-Krishna.

269
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:25,123
Here you are, the Virata has created you,

270
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:29,309
up to a point, brought you to a point.

271
00:47:32,126 --> 00:47:37,039
Now you are just about to flower out

272
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:46,397
and already you are told that, as seeds,
you had some disease in you.

273
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:53,551
So all the great work of evolution,

274
00:47:53,752 --> 00:48:01,469
the great work of taking you to the Kingdom
of God is completely cut out.

275
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,603
So today is the day to be joyous,

276
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,412
to be happy –

277
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:28,895
but not jumping in the sea [but] keeping
to your boat of maryadas –

278
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:41,973
because you have got now your brain
enlightened.

279
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:49,999
This brain is now, such a powerful thing
you have got,

280
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,381
that it pierces through all the five koshas
you have around you,

281
00:48:55,582 --> 00:49:02,543
all the five auras around you, made
by the five elements.

282
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:16,517
This brain touches the subtle of the ether,

283
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,399
the subtle of the Mother Earth,

284
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:30,922
the subtle of all the elements.

285
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:37,214
By this enlightenment you have become
subtle.

286
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:43,378
So we have to forget about the gross
things.

287
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:55,084
Gross things just follow anything that is
subtle just like a magnet attracts.

288
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:10,543
Once in Australia, it was a puja
of Shri Ganesha.

289
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:19,996
And the hibiscus, red flower, is the flower
for Shri Ganesha.

290
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:25,657
And when we were going for the puja,
all around

291
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:29,682
I saw this hibiscus flower coming out.

292
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,406
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “Better stop
the car somewhere,

293
00:50:36,607 --> 00:50:41,902
and get hold of some of these flowers
for the puja."

294
00:50:45,223 --> 00:50:48,509
But then they forgot!

295
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:56,455
You know the mantra, “Ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu bhranti rupena samsthita”.

296
00:50:58,524 --> 00:51:00,529
So the illusion.

297
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:06,827
And then, they suddenly remembered, “Oh
Mother, we’ve forgotten the flowers!”.

298
00:51:11,056 --> 00:51:16,391
I said, “It’s nice you’ve forgotten,
somebody has taken over from you.

299
00:51:18,183 --> 00:51:21,322
That’s why you have forgotten."

300
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:26,795
When we reached the puja thing, the whole
place was filled

301
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:32,396
with baskets and baskets
of those flowers!

302
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:43,190
So when you forget, don’t think that
you have forgotten something,

303
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,967
so something has gone wrong with you.

304
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:57,217
No, it has gone to your subtle
understanding,

305
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:03,992
which works out in a reflex manner,

306
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:10,012
but into sixteen thousand dimensions.

307
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:16,934
Can you imagine an instrument with sixteen
thousand wires

308
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:20,673
connected with another sixteen thousand
wires

309
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:28,955
with another sixteen thousand wires, and
all the time working so efficiently?

310
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,800
This is the work of Virata

311
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:44,973
and this is the work of this enlightened
mind.

312
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:52,331
So you don’t have to worry about the gross
part.

313
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:56,914
You want an ashram, you’ll have it.

314
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:23,213
Anything gross, mundane, will work out.

315
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:28,021
But, at this stage, you must remember

316
00:53:28,222 --> 00:53:34,739
that you have to just put your
attention to it for a minute.

317
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:44,433
Just an attention – what we say is
the bandhan – and it works.

318
00:53:47,749 --> 00:53:49,782
But the main thing one has to remember [is]

319
00:53:49,983 --> 00:53:55,001
that we are Yogis, we are enlightened
souls.

320
00:53:57,263 --> 00:54:02,355
We are specially blessed people with
special powers.

321
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:08,441
And there are very simple ways by which
we can control

322
00:54:08,651 --> 00:54:12,335
all these mundane things.

323
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:21,274
And the whole thing will happen so
beautifully that you’ll be surprised.

324
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:32,238
That is what one has to realise: the powers
of your Sahastrara.

325
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:40,340
I’ve told you that sixteen powers already
were there.

326
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:46,658
So, sixteen powers that were there,
were twelve of the heart

327
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:52,712
and four of Shri Ganesha, were
in your brain already.

328
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:01,253
And that is how you were an emotional
person

329
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:07,160
and you had relationships of emotions
and also relationships

330
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:15,663
with others of innocence as well
as of relationship of marriage.

331
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:29,677
This was all built-in within you.

332
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:38,544
But because of these kind of stupid ideas,
all these natural feelings were suppressed,

333
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:43,839
that nobody was a sister, nobody was
a child, nobody was a brother,

334
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:50,725
and all these stupid ideas have finishes
those beautiful feelings

335
00:55:50,926 --> 00:56:03,192
of flowers, of fragrance – completely
destroyed.

336
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:29,566
The false fears and the false ideas
and the false prohibitions,

337
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:35,345
all have ruined that part of the brain.

338
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:47,071
The ‘gauche’, correct.

339
00:56:48,507 --> 00:56:52,823
Aand the right side started working.

340
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:57,676
Only the right side working.

341
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,931
Then left side doesn’t exist,

342
00:57:02,132 --> 00:57:07,244
all the values of the left side do not
exist.

343
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:14,559
Only the right side and the connection
with the right side,

344
00:57:14,943 --> 00:57:19,390
with the things that we do with the right
side.

345
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:29,775
Also to add it up, so many things came
like industrial revolution

346
00:57:29,976 --> 00:57:36,522
and the war and all that, so the right side
became the dominant part

347
00:57:40,821 --> 00:57:44,284
and this ego developed.

348
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:50,785
Ego makes you feel very important
and you just -

349
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:56,239
love becomes nothing but egocentric.

350
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:07,132
In addition to that, when money became
important,

351
00:58:09,061 --> 00:58:17,238
then it is like somebody who is already
a drunk man, and a scorpion bites him.

352
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:23,078
The situation was very bad.

353
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:31,844
All the ways and methods, permutations
and combinations,

354
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:41,040
of escalating this situation, escalating
this ego was created by the same ego.

355
00:58:50,057 --> 00:58:55,985
This is the most dangerous thing we have
in the West.

356
00:58:57,286 --> 00:59:04,036
For them, even a love for the wife

357
00:59:04,237 --> 00:59:09,580
(Aside: “Thank you. Thank you very much.
It’s alright.”)

358
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:19,057
is a thing to be valued in money.

359
00:59:25,748 --> 00:59:29,376
Everything is business,

360
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:36,235
whether it is church, whether it is mafia,

361
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:39,481
whether it is politics,

362
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:43,591
everything is money.

363
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:47,714
Money becomes the power.

364
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:53,593
Then, if money is everything, why care
for chastity?

365
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:57,702
Why care for innocence?

366
01:00:01,822 --> 01:00:06,076
Why care for art?

367
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:11,391
Whatever can sell is art.

368
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:18,104
Whatever can fetch money is a relationship.

369
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:24,014
So the whole dryness on the left hand side

370
01:00:24,692 --> 01:00:38,038
created a problem again for the left-sided
extremes to be sucked in.

371
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:50,879
So the Collective Subconscious was sucked
into your subconscious mind

372
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,539
and then to your conscious mind.

373
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:09,189
And you can say that the ego reached
such a point into your brain

374
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:15,362
that it started getting into superego,

375
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:27,218
and a very messy personality was created.

376
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,020
So I have to tell you one thing:

377
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:39,572
you are in for your ascent,

378
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:45,887
you are in for getting all your powers,

379
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:57,145
and you are in for your Kingdom of God,

380
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:04,701
but you must work out your left side

381
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:13,083
with understanding of purity,

382
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:18,246
pure relationships,

383
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:23,198
and the right side by facing it,

384
01:02:25,214 --> 01:02:30,037
the facing [of] your plastic ego.

385
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:39,128
When you don’t want to do something,
ask yourself, "Why am I not doing it?"

386
01:02:43,454 --> 01:02:52,696
And when the left side is sucked in,
a lethargy, an inertia sets in.

387
01:02:57,503 --> 01:03:05,121
All the right side gets completely drenched
or completely overpowered

388
01:03:05,322 --> 01:03:11,257
by the left side powerful entities.

389
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:23,999
People feel very tired all the time

390
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:31,134
and they want always to drink or to take
drugs to go to the left side

391
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:36,694
and the inertia sets in.

392
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:41,406
That’s why there’s a problem.

393
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:46,554
But collectively, if we understand this is
the problem,

394
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:54,538
we all can work it out together.

395
01:03:56,366 --> 01:04:00,013
Not despising anyone,

396
01:04:00,489 --> 01:04:04,104
not correcting anyone,

397
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:08,134
but correcting yourself

398
01:04:08,335 --> 01:04:12,137
and not correcting your leaders.

399
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:16,892
It will work out, I'm sure it will
work out.

400
01:04:17,093 --> 01:04:20,036
Today is a great day,

401
01:04:20,237 --> 01:04:24,730
and I remember this France,

402
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,831
such inertia like rock of Gibraltar.

403
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:38,283
I didn’t know how to move their brains;

404
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,099
brains were made of plastic –

405
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,901
what to do with them?

406
01:04:46,102 --> 01:04:50,892
Can you believe, in the first year I came
three times!

407
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:57,425
I went on banging in France and even
English people said,

408
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:01,458
“Mother, why do you go to France so often?”

409
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:13,138
Now, even the English are comparable!

410
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:21,337
I should have been equally dynamic
about them,

411
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:24,810
and I was.

412
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:30,856
It was a work of tremendous patience,
and love,

413
01:05:33,546 --> 01:05:40,738
of understanding that they are deserving
cases

414
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:47,325
lost in the wilderness of ego.

415
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:57,376
But they are the ones who will save Europe,

416
01:05:57,965 --> 01:06:02,002
England and America.

417
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:05,139
May God bless you.

418
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:18,977
You just can - you can remove it
(the microphone).

419
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:30,816
Now. Is Gavin here? Gavin is good. Just…

420
01:06:31,017 --> 01:06:35,858
Yogi: Gavin. Gavin.

421
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:42,612
Shri Mataji: Also Guido has to come...
Yogi: Guido.

422
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:47,141
Shri Mataji: All the leaders must come,
I think, it’s better that they come…

423
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:54,335
What is that?

424
01:06:57,316 --> 01:07:03,184
Who made it? Good, thank you.

425
01:07:17,656 --> 01:07:21,156
Come front to this side, hallo, come along.

426
01:07:39,868 --> 01:07:46,453
Come (Conversation aside with Gavin,
not completely audible)…

427
01:07:47,854 --> 01:07:52,253
Say the Atharva Sheersha, I hope some
people know by heart.

428
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:54,682
Gavin: They’ve got it in their hands now.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

429
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:56,815
Gavin: Everybody has it in their hands.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

430
01:07:57,016 --> 01:07:59,640
Gavin: They’ve got five hundred copies.

431
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:01,564
Shri Mataji: Alright. So you can do Atharva
Sheersha.

432
01:08:01,765 --> 01:08:07,548
And you could get children to wash My feet,
they are quite a lot.

433
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:12,974
Too many! Big problem.

434
01:08:13,175 --> 01:08:18,328
Alright. You can have them. With three
Atharva Sheersha you should finish all…

435
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:23,607
you look after, say, “Now it’s over time”.

436
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:33,751
Then you have – already you have done
the hundred and eight names of Vishnu…

437
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:37,251
Gavin: Yes, we take the names and…
Shri Mataji: Only the twenty-one names

438
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:40,978
which they do before the puja, you know
that? Gavin: Yes.

439
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:45,778
Shri Mataji: And then you can do the Devi’s
names, I think. Gavin: It’s fine.

440
01:08:46,273 --> 01:08:52,579
Shri Mataji: But… while doing the Krishna’s
names

441
01:08:57,095 --> 01:09:03,376
you can wash the hands and the feet.
While doing the Devi’s names,

442
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:12,330
you can dress Me up, it’s possible;

443
01:09:15,074 --> 01:09:19,005
or if you know some songs of Krishna,
instead of taking His names,

444
01:09:19,206 --> 01:09:21,864
you can sing it.
Gavin: No.

445
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:23,453
Gregoire: Radha Krishna Bajile?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

446
01:09:23,654 --> 01:09:25,526
Gregoire: Radha Krishna Bajile?
Shri Mataji: You have?

447
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,531
Gregoire: If people know.
Shri Mataji: Some fews.

448
01:09:27,732 --> 01:09:30,691
Gavin: People are there. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Gavin: The music people are there.

449
01:09:30,892 --> 01:09:34,059
Shri Mataji: All right, is alright.

450
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:43,230
You see, could be better to have it music
a little bit.

451
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,500
Again it becomes very serious, you see.

452
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:03,122
All right. So you can sit next to the
thing. Gavin: Yes.

453
01:10:03,323 --> 01:10:09,126
Shri Mataji: And who else knows the
mantras? I think, Guido can come.

454
01:10:09,723 --> 01:10:12,823
Here, here, this side.

455
01:10:27,443 --> 01:10:31,492
Otherwise, actually let the leaders wash
the feet, it’s better.

456
01:10:31,693 --> 01:10:38,506
Gavin? Let the leaders wash the feet.
It’s better because they’ll cleanse out.

457
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,004
From where did you get this one?
Pujari: I don’t know, we had…

458
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:47,550
Shri Mataji: It’s poisonous!
Yogi: Which one?

459
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:54,311
Shri Mataji: This Datura. This is
for Shankara.

460
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:59,718
[Yogi: Shri Shiva] For Shankara,
it’s all right.

461
01:11:04,472 --> 01:11:08,903
Krishna’s flower is called as Krishna
kamal.

462
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:12,963
That type don’t grows here. It’s
a beautiful flower,

463
01:11:13,164 --> 01:11:19,200
called as Krishna kamal. Is a colour
of that, that sky colour.

464
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:22,266
That’s Shri Krishna colour. (Hindi)

465
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:29,042
Possibly, possibly, I think I saw it
in Switzerland in your house,

466
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:32,145
first house, a Krishna kamal flower.
You had it there?

467
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:36,726
Yogi: Yes…
Shri Mataji: Is a kind of a creeper.

468
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:44,023
But that was not very unique, because you
had all kinds of … (indistinct), isn’t it?

469
01:11:44,224 --> 01:11:47,286
Yogi: Just see if it is hot.
Shri Mataji: Mm? It’s all right.

470
01:11:48,098 --> 01:11:52,695
Now. You can start. Now, one person
should be in charge of water.

471
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:54,951
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And lastly
that person... Accha.

472
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:59,467
Now, they want to keep the water here,
handy, or you may - closer.

473
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:05,065
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: One by one, you
have to come and wash My feet. All right?

474
01:12:09,596 --> 01:12:14,231
Now. You start it. Now. Water - you could
be in charge for the time being.

475
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,183
Have you washed My feet, ah? Start it.

476
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,943
[Yogis recite Ganesha Atharva Sheersha]

477
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:29,448
Shri Mataji: Somebody should… (unclear).

478
01:13:54,156 --> 01:13:57,828
Good. Good. May God bless you.

479
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:49,368
May God bless you.

480
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:09,377
May God bless you. Looking like a gopa!

481
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:02,264
May God bless you.

482
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:20,300
Good.

483
01:18:21,193 --> 01:18:24,057
Good!

484
01:18:41,286 --> 01:18:45,040
Now. It's good. Good.

485
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:05,944
Same water you can you this also. (not clear)

486
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:12,531
Warren, you can use the same water.

487
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:22,961
Rub it hard.

488
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:35,903
With the one hand. Moving.

489
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,326
Good.

490
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:57,281
Good. All right. May God bless you.

491
01:21:03,766 --> 01:21:07,112
All right. All right.

492
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:09,751
May God bless you.

493
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:25,371
May God bless you.

494
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:12,560
May God bless you. Good. Excellent.

495
01:22:34,522 --> 01:22:38,048
All right. Excellent.

496
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:56,594
You can sing the song of Ganesha now,
it’s all right. You can sing the song.

497
01:22:56,795 --> 01:23:00,195
Yogi: Shri Ganesha?
Shri Mataji: It’s good.

498
01:23:00,404 --> 01:23:02,957
They can sing the song
of Shri Ganesha’s song.

499
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:10,076
It is – will be better. Should be more
music in Shri Krishna’s…

500
01:23:29,502 --> 01:23:36,260
Yogi 1: Which song? Yogi 2: Shri Ganesha.
Yogi 3: Shri Ganesha.

501
01:23:46,997 --> 01:23:51,433
[“Om Bhur Bhuvah Swaha” is sung]

502
01:28:10,403 --> 01:28:14,301
Done. Exactly at the right time.

503
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:20,006
All right. Now the second one – I mean,

504
01:28:22,185 --> 01:28:26,395
the hundred and eight names of the Goddess;

505
01:28:26,596 --> 01:28:32,697
but also there’s a better way, is
to sing it, because they have got –

506
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:37,635
Gavin, they have got it in music?

507
01:28:38,035 --> 01:28:42,936
All the songs of – first of all

508
01:28:43,137 --> 01:28:49,436
the Adi Shankaracharya’s song would be
good idea.

509
01:28:49,637 --> 01:28:52,463
It flows the vibrations very well.

510
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:57,904
Now. Christine? Christine?

511
01:28:59,098 --> 01:29:04,307
You get about six ladies from France.

512
01:29:09,133 --> 01:29:11,991
Married ladies.

513
01:29:32,846 --> 01:29:37,127
Yogi: Catherine from Mulhouse, Catherine
from Mulhouse.

514
01:29:42,523 --> 01:29:46,550
Shri Mataji: …here should not be seated
that side, they should be able to see Me.

515
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:50,116
Let’s push a little that side.

516
01:30:17,146 --> 01:30:24,828
[Tere Hi Guna Gate Hai, the song with
the 108 names of Shri Mataji is sung]

517
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:14,983
[Shri Mataji calls the pujari saying that
‘it’s quite hot for Me’]

518
01:34:42,236 --> 01:34:45,195
Pujari: Yogurt or more of this?

519
01:34:54,211 --> 01:34:59,064
Shri Mataji to a yogini: My sari is…

520
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:45,627
Water...

521
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:22,338
My hands...
Pujari: Yogurt?

522
01:39:38,461 --> 01:39:41,080
Shri Mataji: Water.

523
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,429
Good.
Pujari: Yogurt more?

524
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:54,796
Guido: Bolo Jagan Mata Adi Shakti Mataji
Shri Nirmala Devi ki!

525
01:42:54,997 --> 01:42:57,510
Yogis: Jai!

526
01:43:25,402 --> 01:43:28,981
Shri Mataji: And leave the other hand
still…

527
01:43:35,277 --> 01:43:37,880
Then water.

528
01:43:58,627 --> 01:44:03,708
Let's say Adi Shankaracharya’s this thing
is very important.

529
01:44:05,514 --> 01:44:09,356
You can sing Adi Shankaryacharya's...?

530
01:44:09,564 --> 01:44:12,703
Some girls have sung, I don’t know.

531
01:44:16,606 --> 01:44:18,232
Antonio Scialò: More milk, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Ah?

532
01:44:18,433 --> 01:44:21,568
Antonio Scialò: More milk, or sugar?
Shri Mataji: More milk.

533
01:44:21,769 --> 01:44:24,729
Antonio Scialò: Can you put more milk
in this?

534
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,928
Shri Mataji: I feel so cool.
Yogi 1: Yes.

535
01:44:52,129 --> 01:44:54,889
Yogi 2: Yes, Shri Mataji, it's cool.
Shri Mataji: Hm.

536
01:45:03,933 --> 01:45:06,892
Let's put some water...

537
01:45:21,928 --> 01:45:25,604
Shri Mataji: ... (unclear question)?

538
01:45:25,805 --> 01:45:30,840
Pujari: Christian is on the way... He left
immediately after the talk, Shri Mataji.

539
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:51,970
["Ai Giri Nandini" is sung]

540
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,790
Shri Mataji: You were beautiful.

541
01:52:46,991 --> 01:52:51,745
Any other songs that you would like
to sing? Amhi Mataji.

542
01:52:51,946 --> 01:52:54,710
Guido: Amhi Mataji. Yogi: Amhi Mataji.

543
01:53:00,337 --> 01:53:03,297
Shri Mataji: The sugar is best...

544
01:54:24,623 --> 01:54:28,964
["Amhi Mataji" is sung]

545
02:04:07,988 --> 02:04:13,471
Get some more ladies, you see? Get some
more ladies from France.

546
02:04:47,806 --> 02:04:52,575
Yes. It’s all right. Just put the...
on this one.

547
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:56,819
Yeah.

548
02:05:27,912 --> 02:05:30,044
Yeah.

549
02:05:32,051 --> 02:05:37,304
Just - Just put it here - down below.

550
02:05:37,514 --> 02:05:41,508
Still swastika is to be created.

551
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:46,067
Keep it in the center. (Yogini: Yes)
Good.

552
02:05:50,255 --> 02:05:55,206
No, no, you have to put that also.

553
02:05:55,707 --> 02:05:58,057
Put on this one also.

554
02:05:59,513 --> 02:06:03,983
Put some red at the end of it.

555
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:28,899
Put the swastika on it.

556
02:06:29,885 --> 02:06:33,404
Yogi: May we sing Radha Krishna?

557
02:06:40,794 --> 02:06:44,699
Shri Mataji: (Aside to lady) It’s all right.
Yogi: May we sing Radha Krishna?

558
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:48,506
 Shri Mataji: Hm? Yes, let us go on,
some… yes.

559
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:57,511
Guido: Radha Krishna. Radha Krishna Bajare.

560
02:06:58,344 --> 02:07:03,204
Shri Mataji: Or should be sung the hundred
and eight names, would be all right, or…

561
02:07:04,349 --> 02:07:07,812
Or Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu.

562
02:07:09,102 --> 02:07:12,589
Guido: Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu.

563
02:07:14,575 --> 02:07:18,125
Yogi: Sanscrit: Ya Devi Sarwa...

564
02:07:26,112 --> 02:07:28,492
Shri Mataji: (Aside) It’s all right.

565
02:07:37,795 --> 02:07:43,276
Shri Mataji: Yes… it’s all put …
sufficiently?

566
02:08:07,529 --> 02:08:12,912
In the middle of the fingers, those.

567
02:08:13,137 --> 02:08:20,319
(Hindi) In the middle of the fingers.

568
02:08:27,441 --> 02:08:31,615
[“Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu” is sung]

569
02:16:05,392 --> 02:16:08,655
Shri Mataji: Done now, finished.

570
02:16:18,008 --> 02:16:20,778
It’s too tight…

571
02:16:45,331 --> 02:16:48,760
It's been quite long, I think.

572
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:58,891
Now the… beautiful!

573
02:17:12,132 --> 02:17:15,024
This is at the – this is at the back,
you see, thissari.

574
02:17:15,225 --> 02:17:17,040
Yogini: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

575
02:17:17,241 --> 02:17:18,471
Shri Mataji: This is in front.
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

576
02:17:18,672 --> 02:17:21,838
Shri Mataji: All right. Put it the other
way round.

577
02:17:22,039 --> 02:17:25,279
Give Me the mirror. (Hindi)

578
02:17:36,602 --> 02:17:40,620
It's very big head.
Yogini: Put it here, Mother.

579
02:17:50,077 --> 02:17:54,759
Shri Mataji: Still tighter, for a small
head!

580
02:17:57,885 --> 02:18:00,181
Ladies laugh: We are sorry, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Forgotten.

581
02:18:00,422 --> 02:18:03,938
They always take a big head for me.

582
02:18:06,053 --> 02:18:10,620
All right now. It’s still little bit…
all right. This I'll manage.

583
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:14,529
Now, can I have the comb? (Hindi)

584
02:18:21,087 --> 02:18:23,801
It’s beautiful!

585
02:18:28,641 --> 02:18:32,262
Beautiful. All right.

586
02:18:32,883 --> 02:18:37,339
Take out this, put some other cloth.
No, not that…

587
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:42,185
So fragrant. Coloured one, yellow one.

588
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:57,282
All right, what I’ll do, I’ll put this
shawl, My shawl.

589
02:18:57,490 --> 02:19:01,960
It’s better with My shawl. But this won’t
show, you see, the colour.

590
02:19:02,851 --> 02:19:09,000
It’s all right. All right. That’s better.

591
02:19:16,898 --> 02:19:19,900
Now. Put all these flowers.

592
02:19:21,976 --> 02:19:25,930
What you can do is to put the shawl
and put all the flowers around.

593
02:19:26,131 --> 02:19:28,783
You should put all these…

594
02:19:33,261 --> 02:19:35,538
All right?

595
02:19:43,124 --> 02:19:45,664
All right. Now. Put all the flowers.

596
02:19:45,867 --> 02:19:49,986
I think, let the men do it.  You must let
them put the sari on.

597
02:19:50,187 --> 02:19:53,524
And let them garland Me with the sari.

598
02:19:55,106 --> 02:19:58,155
You have to be putting the sari.

599
02:20:02,424 --> 02:20:07,689
Any Krishna’s bhajan or something
you can say? All right.

600
02:20:11,584 --> 02:20:15,609
Take it on top. Now.
Guido: Josè?

601
02:20:19,282 --> 02:20:24,493
Antonio? Radha Krishna.

602
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:52,993

on that.

You can remove a little. You want
to decorate something else?

607
02:29:25,788 --> 02:29:29,177
This side? You can remove that.

608
02:29:39,301 --> 02:29:41,760
Hm, finger.

609
02:31:07,088 --> 02:31:09,577
Take a full (picture).

610
02:31:15,545 --> 02:31:19,563
Just pull this out a little bit. Loosen
it out. Yes.

611
02:31:19,764 --> 02:31:23,106
Little bit, yes. Yes.

612
02:31:31,331 --> 02:31:35,961
Take one full photograph, the full.

613
02:32:11,096 --> 02:32:14,526
Yogi: This is present from the Austrian
sahaja yogis but for all of us.

614
02:32:14,727 --> 02:32:17,735
It’s pure silver, and we want all to become
pure like this.

615
02:32:17,936 --> 02:32:19,675
And hollow like this. Shri Mataji: It’s pure
silver! Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

616
02:32:19,876 --> 02:32:23,029
Shri Mataji: Oh God! So I just don’t know
this one how to play,

617
02:32:23,230 --> 02:32:26,357
you see, I know Indian ones! All right.

618
02:32:30,384 --> 02:32:34,973
It won’t work out with Me. All right,
I’ll have to learn.

619
02:32:42,357 --> 02:32:44,930
May God bless you.

620
02:32:56,589 --> 02:33:01,573
Hm, put like that.

621
02:33:42,397 --> 02:33:47,970
Beautiful. This is a modern one.

All right. Yogi: Vibrated Prasad, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

625

Yogi: Vibrated Prasad?
Shri Mataji: Yes, vibrate.

626
02:34:18,871 --> 02:34:22,817
Good! Ah, that’s a good idea.

627
02:34:24,183 --> 02:34:30,887
No... That’s all, it’s too much for Me
to eat everything.

628
02:34:39,482 --> 02:34:42,474
Krishna never ate cakes.

629
02:34:45,219 --> 02:34:50,544
Hm. I wish Krishna had all this!

630

of Canada (a small elephant).

to all of them? Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful, isn’t it? Made
so beautifully.

635
02:35:19,995 --> 02:35:24,332
How did you make it so well? Yogi:
One of the sahaja yogis did the frame…

636
02:35:24,533 --> 02:35:28,311
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Yogi And they...

637
02:35:33,097 --> 02:35:37,116
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, thank you.
So I’ll keep one.

638

640
02:36:04,938 --> 02:36:08,474
Shri Mataji: Already made it warm.

641

These are endless, I think.
Yogi: Yes.

642

Few will do!...

643
02:36:40,537 --> 02:36:43,066
What’s that?

Yogi: Basilic for all the centers.

645

Yogi: Basilic, basil.

Other yogi: Tulsi.
Yogi: Tulsi, yes.

647
02:37:15,746 --> 02:37:18,309
Shri Mataji: Oh, this is too much.

648
02:37:19,152 --> 02:37:22,050
 All right for the seeds.

649
02:37:23,574 --> 02:37:25,943
All right.
Yogi: This is betel leaves, Shri Mataji.

650
02:37:26,153 --> 02:37:29,653
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogi: Comes from India.
It comes from India.

651
02:37:38,792 --> 02:37:42,444
Shri Mataji: The leaves – one should be
eating all this?

652
02:37:45,259 --> 02:37:49,882
It’s too much. Guido: There are twenty
more, little more.

653
02:37:50,691 --> 02:37:55,888
Shri Mataji: Oh, I think you mix them up,
isn’t it? It’s too much.

654
02:37:59,607 --> 02:38:01,934
It’s all right.

655
02:38:03,079 --> 02:38:05,539
Get up.

656
02:38:26,725 --> 02:38:30,265
Better all of you stay here.
Yogi: All of you come.

657
02:38:34,476 --> 02:38:39,723
Just (Hindi) touch each other is the best.

658
02:38:40,450 --> 02:38:44,215
That you can hold it separately… yes.

659
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:51,642
You know, you do it this way and this way.

660
02:38:51,843 --> 02:38:56,587
And when you take it down, three times.
Start.

661
02:38:58,718 --> 02:39:02,211
[Aarti]

662
02:45:36,298 --> 02:45:39,863
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

663
02:45:40,064 --> 02:45:45,199
Beautiful, everybody's beautiful.

664
02:45:46,376 --> 02:45:52,953
Christine? Take out this. Beautiful
vibrations. Beautiful, beautiful.

665
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:56,419
Yogini: Thank you, Shri Mataji.

666
02:46:09,424 --> 02:46:14,810
Shri Mataji: There’s - Give her a plate,
for Christine also.

667
02:46:16,860 --> 02:46:19,046
Beautiful.

668
02:46:25,761 --> 02:46:30,524
As they count their money, give it
to Gavin, I have to give it to Antonio.

669
02:46:30,725 --> 02:46:33,084
This one also.

670
02:47:06,344 --> 02:47:10,297
I think, better is wash My feet,
is better. Antonio Scialò: Yes.

671
02:47:24,507 --> 02:47:28,142
Shri Mataji: These other sweets I brought
for children.

672
02:47:30,313 --> 02:47:34,003
Put them in a - one big…

673
02:47:36,954 --> 02:47:43,485
Now. Please keep it here, please.
Put it on…

674
02:47:58,756 --> 02:48:04,330
Big and small. Children big and small.

675
02:48:14,734 --> 02:48:19,499
Wah wah, the heat!

676
02:48:21,239 --> 02:48:25,876
When the energy flows too much heat
is always…

677
02:48:29,739 --> 02:48:34,996
It’s all right, in My – it’s in My purse.

678
02:48:40,083 --> 02:48:45,640
You have to use it. Just washing it.

679
02:48:46,936 --> 02:48:49,400
Oh!

680
02:48:50,336 --> 02:48:52,784
I’ve got...
Yogi: There is the true one from Belgium.

681
02:48:52,985 --> 02:48:58,962
Shri Mataji: Oh, you already bought it!
Oh, that’s very sweet.

682
02:48:59,163 --> 02:49:01,359
There is one there. Thank you very much,
thank you.

683
02:49:01,567 --> 02:49:05,369
I have one already in My purse,
but it’s all right.

684
02:49:10,486 --> 02:49:15,554
Very good. It’s tremendous, eh?
Yogi: He is a specialist, Mother.

685
02:49:17,249 --> 02:49:19,884
I must say!

686
02:49:28,177 --> 02:49:33,210
Ah, what a nice one. From Belgium.

687
02:49:36,414 --> 02:49:40,502
See? Thank you.

688
02:49:40,703 --> 02:49:45,762
High timing, high timing, Belgium!

689
02:49:48,038 --> 02:49:51,731
I want to give it to all of you.

690
02:49:57,724 --> 02:50:00,113
This is the cake.

691
02:50:00,757 --> 02:50:04,951
(To Christine) You washed all right,
cleaned out quite a lot.

692
02:50:09,991 --> 02:50:12,539
Thank you. Done? Or not? Still more?

693
02:50:12,745 --> 02:50:15,121
I don’t think. That’s all.

694
02:50:15,322 --> 02:50:20,885
It should be all… just wipe it.
One go the whole lot.

695
02:50:34,136 --> 02:50:38,365
Children have made it? Yogi: Yes, Shri
Mataji, and they have written on the thing,

696
02:50:38,566 --> 02:50:43,072
“May our heart be a cushion for Your Feet”.

697
02:51:03,736 --> 02:51:07,477
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. What an idea!

698
02:51:08,447 --> 02:51:09,957
It’s done? I think it’s all done.

699
02:51:10,158 --> 02:51:11,938
Antonio Scialò: We wonder should we give
water for the centers?

700
02:51:12,139 --> 02:51:14,617
Shri Mataji: Eh? Antonio Scialò: Should we
give water for the centers?

701
02:51:14,818 --> 02:51:17,092
Shri Mataji: Eh? Water? Antonio Scialò:
Should we keep that water for the centers?

702
02:51:17,293 --> 02:51:22,115
Shri Mataji: Yes, some water is to be…
Yogi: This is tulsi leaves, basilic,

703
02:51:22,316 --> 02:51:25,508
and there is one basket per country.
When – one basket.

704
02:51:25,709 --> 02:51:27,878
Shri Mataji: Yes.

705
02:51:47,889 --> 02:51:50,532
Are you going to distribute to everyone?
Yogi: Pardon?

706
02:51:50,733 --> 02:51:53,702
Shri Mataji: They can come this way and
you can pass on when they are going out.

707
02:51:53,903 --> 02:51:56,529
Would be better.

708
02:51:56,730 --> 02:51:59,932
I would suggest that when they are
going out, you can give them one each,

709
02:52:00,133 --> 02:52:01,694
will be easier.
Yogi: We'll do.

710
02:52:01,895 --> 02:52:06,251
Shri Mataji: Otherwise, everybody coming
will be too much time.

711
02:52:13,934 --> 02:52:16,384
What’s that?

712
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:23,190
Yogi: A collective… Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi:… offering for…

713
02:52:23,391 --> 02:52:27,578
Shri Mataji: Collective offering, what is
that?

714
02:52:29,253 --> 02:52:34,067
Collective... like a big Krishna’s flute,
or what?

715
02:52:34,268 --> 02:52:37,644
Yogi (joking): A big sweet, a long sweet.

716
02:52:43,184 --> 02:52:49,187
Shri Mataji: What you’ve given Me? Oh oh.

717
02:52:50,635 --> 02:52:56,199
That’s the limit, I tell you, really!
What a beauty.

718
02:52:56,400 --> 02:53:00,138
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Beautiful.

719
02:53:02,683 --> 02:53:04,758
This is the largest one I've ever had.

720
02:53:04,959 --> 02:53:09,740
Thank you very much, very great.
Beautiful, is such a beauty.

721
02:53:19,366 --> 02:53:22,431
Very beautiful.

722
02:53:22,632 --> 02:53:26,870
It’s Chinese, is it?
Yogi: Chinese style, yes, Shri Mataji.

723
02:53:27,071 --> 02:53:29,904
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful colours.

724
02:53:30,105 --> 02:53:33,813
All Krishna’s colours, beautiful,
beautiful.

725
02:53:34,014 --> 02:53:40,155
Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful.

726
02:53:40,410 --> 02:53:45,234
Yogi: It's for the new house, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: For the new house, all right.

727
02:53:45,435 --> 02:53:48,411
Ah! Who’s made this?

728
02:53:48,612 --> 02:53:51,866
Child: From all the children. Shri Mataji:
Who? Child: From all the children.

729
02:53:52,067 --> 02:53:54,752
Shri Mataji: All the children! Thank you
very much,

730
02:53:54,959 --> 02:53:57,982
and giving Me one child more, all right?
Thank you, thank you very,

731
02:53:58,183 --> 02:54:02,392
beautifully done it with hand. It's done
so well! Beautiful!

732
02:54:02,593 --> 02:54:05,495
Show them, show them.

733
02:54:20,238 --> 02:54:22,986
(Aside to Christine) I think, you should
put it carefully to...

734
02:54:23,187 --> 02:54:27,177
I think, best is to give it to him.

735
02:54:27,378 --> 02:54:30,106
Yogi: Shri Mataji, many times You…

736
02:54:30,307 --> 02:54:34,347
Shri Mataji: I mean, everybody’s giving now
is it, it’s going to be too much!

737
02:54:34,548 --> 02:54:43,074
Yogi: Shri Mataji, many times You told us
that Lakshmi are our Shaktis,

738
02:54:43,291 --> 02:54:49,822
and this present is a collective work
of all the Lakshmi of France.

739
02:54:50,023 --> 02:54:53,478
Shri Mataji: Oh, wah!

740
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:02,112
Thank you very much! What is it?

741
02:55:02,313 --> 02:55:05,918
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

742
02:55:06,119 --> 02:55:08,320
May God bless you all. Thank you.

743
02:55:08,521 --> 02:55:13,785
Yogi: I must say, Shri Mataji, each one of
them did a piece, did one of these works.

744
02:55:13,986 --> 02:55:19,710
Shri Mataji: I see. Yogi: And it was quite
funny when the whole thing was assembled…

745
02:55:19,911 --> 02:55:21,808
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Yogi: … they tried to find their one,

746
02:55:22,009 --> 02:55:30,348
they never found the one they’d done, it
was absolutely mixed into the collective.

747
02:55:37,365 --> 02:55:43,401
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Excellent!
Yogi: And…

748
02:55:43,602 --> 02:55:51,763
Shri Mataji: Remarkable, beautiful. Very
beautiful, like the feathers of a peacock.

749
02:55:51,964 --> 02:55:54,387
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

750
02:55:54,588 --> 02:55:58,625
Thank you very much, thank you.
May God bless you. Thank you.

751
02:55:58,826 --> 02:56:02,775
What a design. What a design, beautiful.

752
02:56:02,997 --> 02:56:08,406
Is a Sahastrara design, in the Sahastrara
ego and superego like that.

753
02:56:10,282 --> 02:56:13,031
Yes.

754
02:56:14,486 --> 02:56:20,085
Beautiful. Thank you very much, thank you.

755
02:56:21,833 --> 02:56:24,599
First class.

756
02:56:32,671 --> 02:56:35,581
How much time they must have taken.
Yogi: They worked collectively.

757
02:56:35,782 --> 02:56:39,104
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: They worked collectively.

758
02:56:42,353 --> 02:56:46,167
Yogi: And ehen they started to work on it,
it was very pleasant to see, Shri Mataji:

759
02:56:46,368 --> 02:56:49,744
some Lakshmi, You know, who had been
fighting in the past, You know, with ego,

760
02:56:49,966 --> 02:56:53,818
and they were just discussing in a sweet way, when they were sewing/flowing?,

761
02:56:54,019 --> 02:56:55,888
It was absolutely wonderful!

762
02:56:56,089 --> 02:57:01,793
Shri Mataji: This is your leader’s trick

763
02:57:12,039 --> 02:57:15,663
to end up the problem.

764
02:57:19,877 --> 02:57:23,782
Should I tell them?
Yogi: Why not?

765
02:57:26,057 --> 02:57:30,893
Shri Mataji: Patrick tells Me that it was
very surprising that all of them

766
02:57:31,094 --> 02:57:35,455
used to quarrel among themselves and
used to be little differences.

767
02:57:35,673 --> 02:57:39,356
But when they started - yes.

768
02:57:43,163 --> 02:57:47,507
Little girl: For you, Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: Thank you!

769
02:57:50,792 --> 02:57:56,540
And when they started working…
From whom is it? From whom is this…?

770
02:57:56,741 --> 02:58:00,569
Yogini: From Alsace. Yogis reply:
From Alsace. From the East of France.

771
02:58:00,792 --> 02:58:03,271
Thank you, thank you.
Yogi: Strasbourg and...

772
02:58:03,472 --> 02:58:10,518
So, then he, he said that they started
working on the pattern

773
02:58:10,719 --> 02:58:14,616
and the making of the quilt,  and they were
very friendly

774
02:58:14,817 --> 02:58:20,008
and were delicately doing it, and very
sweetly talking to each other

775
02:58:20,209 --> 02:58:25,573
and he was amazed. So I said:
“This is their leader’s trick!”

776
02:58:38,482 --> 02:58:41,715
Trick of the leader.

777
02:58:45,114 --> 02:58:50,841
Always a leader should never discuss
the problems of the followers:

778
02:58:51,042 --> 02:58:54,349
but give them problems!

779
02:59:05,109 --> 02:59:08,697
For example, if the children are fighting,
so you tell them,

780
02:59:08,906 --> 02:59:15,883
“We have to go for picnic, next year.
Can you plan it now?”

781
02:59:23,124 --> 02:59:28,300
Yogi: (In French): All right, Michel, will
you do it? I said, "Yes, Michel..."

782
02:59:28,501 --> 02:59:34,490
Yes, that’s it. That’s how it works,
that’s the leadership.

783
02:59:36,111 --> 02:59:39,489
Oh, beautiful.

784
02:59:41,626 --> 02:59:47,839
What a beauty, I tell you. Very beautiful
it is.

785
02:59:50,380 --> 02:59:53,038
Very sweet.

786
02:59:56,440 --> 02:59:58,745
Very beautiful. Thank you very much!

787
02:59:58,946 --> 03:00:02,111
You must put the name here, whosoever has
given. Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

788
03:00:02,312 --> 03:00:06,632
Shri Mataji: Should be the name always
with that, you see, so that I know.

789
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:19,035
This is from?
Yogia: Marseille.

790
03:00:19,236 --> 03:00:22,935
Oh I see, thank you very much, thank you.

791
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:33,271
Marseille.

792
03:00:42,835 --> 03:00:48,955
Have you got Prasad or not? All the leaders
haven’t got any Prasad!

793
03:00:50,672 --> 03:00:53,735
Poor.
Yogi: For getting problems!

794
03:01:13,933 --> 03:01:17,561
Shri Mataji: Beautiful!
Yogi: It is Notre Dame de belle Garde...

795
03:01:17,762 --> 03:01:21,550
Yogi 2 corrects: de la Garde. Yogi: ...de
la Garde - the virgin which is at the top,

796
03:01:21,751 --> 03:01:24,493
which is dominating on Marseille,
the cathedral of Marseille.

797
03:01:24,704 --> 03:01:27,207
Shri Mataji: I see. Yogi: And there is
absolutely nice vibration

798
03:01:27,408 --> 03:01:30,065
when we are in Marseille… Shri Mataji:
Beautiful, this one is such a beautiful one.

799
03:01:30,266 --> 03:01:32,808
Very beautiful.

800
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:37,956
Thank you very much!

801
03:01:46,029 --> 03:01:49,818
Just hand it over to, I think, hm...

802
03:01:50,375 --> 03:01:53,432
Dr. Spiro should keep all these things,
look at these things. Yogi: Yes.

803
03:01:53,665 --> 03:01:57,296
Shri Mataji: Thank you. It’s a wonderful
thing.

804
03:01:57,511 --> 03:02:01,439
Translator: (In French) Any other presents from Provence?

805
03:02:04,941 --> 03:02:08,878
Yogi: Montpellier.
Shri Mataji: (Hindi)

806
03:02:10,986 --> 03:02:19,022
Ah. Shukriya. (Hindi)  Thank you, beautiful.

807
03:02:23,379 --> 03:02:26,792
Yogi: This is a present from Montpellier.
Shri Mataji: From Montpellier.

808
03:02:26,993 --> 03:02:30,593
Oh, beautiful!
Yogi: Table set, table set.

809
03:02:31,332 --> 03:02:34,158
Shri Mataji: Tell them.

810
03:02:35,986 --> 03:02:38,627
Beautiful, see.
Yogi: The texture is from Provence.

811
03:02:38,828 --> 03:02:41,676
Another yogi: It’s a traditional design.
Shri Mataji: Is a traditional design,

812
03:02:41,877 --> 03:02:46,486
 from Montpellier. Beautiful. Oh, very
beautiful.

813
03:02:46,687 --> 03:02:51,908
Thank you very much. You see, all they too
traditionally following our patterns,

814
03:02:52,116 --> 03:02:55,222
isn’t it? Just open it.

815
03:02:55,423 --> 03:02:59,910
(The translator explains that the patterns
of Provence resemble those of Kashmir

816
03:03:00,111 --> 03:03:04,832
and have some small Kundalinis)
Shri Mataji: Same, same designs.

817
03:03:07,114 --> 03:03:11,278
Thank you very much, thank you, beautiful,
thank you.

818
03:03:17,491 --> 03:03:23,004
There’s no - Beautiful. How many centers
you have?

819
03:03:23,205 --> 03:03:25,944
Yogi: Let’s start: in the center of France
there is Paris... Shri Mataji: Ah.

820
03:03:26,145 --> 03:03:31,186
Yogi: ...and all the other centers are
at the border: Rouen, Reims, Nantes,

821
03:03:31,386 --> 03:03:37,921
Montpellier, Marseille, Lyon, Mulhouse,
Strasbourg, and Nîmes.

822
03:03:38,130 --> 03:03:40,296
Shri Mataji: From Strasbourg she’s not
come? Yogini: Yes.

823
03:03:40,497 --> 03:03:44,410
Shri Mataji: She’s here, Ruth? Yogi: Ruth
is no more in Strasbourg. She is in…

824
03:03:44,611 --> 03:03:47,640
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Oh wah!

825
03:03:47,841 --> 03:03:54,574
This is for Germany! Good idea.
Beautiful!

826
03:03:56,762 --> 03:04:03,686
It’s very beautiful. Really, beautiful.
May God bless you.

827
03:04:03,887 --> 03:04:06,895
All right. Such a nice one, just have
a look.

828
03:04:07,096 --> 03:04:12,767
Just show them – it’s quite heavy though –
show them. Is the Mother.

829
03:04:13,859 --> 03:04:17,645
German yogi: And this one is the collective
present for all the nations from Germany.

830
03:04:17,846 --> 03:04:20,005
Shri Mataji: From all the?
German yogi: Sorry?

831
03:04:20,206 --> 03:04:22,955
It’s the present from Germany for all
the different countries.

832
03:04:23,156 --> 03:04:29,219
And we will distribute to every national
leader a poster like this after the puja.

833
03:04:29,420 --> 03:04:33,734
It’s from the Indian tour.
Shri Mataji: Oh!

834
03:04:43,606 --> 03:04:46,955
Yogi (joking): On the bus!

835
03:04:51,001 --> 03:04:53,987
Shri Mataji: This is for Me? German yogi:
Sorry? Shri Mataji: This is for Me?

836
03:04:54,195 --> 03:04:56,917
German yogi: Yes, this is for You.
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much.

837
03:04:57,118 --> 03:05:05,496
Beautiful. Is a very nice one. All of you
there, I can see them at a glance.

838
03:05:09,673 --> 03:05:11,847
Yogi: Embroideries from the children.
Shri Mataji: From where?

839
03:05:12,048 --> 03:05:15,255
Yogi: From the children of the camp, of the
holiday camp. Shri Mataji: Oh, how sweet.

840
03:05:15,456 --> 03:05:19,205
Thank you very much, thank you.

841
03:05:30,927 --> 03:05:33,340
Oh, I’ll have to put them
in the exhibition,

842
03:05:33,541 --> 03:05:37,827
but you must – you have not signed
your names!

843
03:05:38,740 --> 03:05:41,608
Translator: It’s collective, Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you.

844
03:05:41,809 --> 03:05:46,153
In the collective they don’t write names,
that’s true.

845
03:05:47,942 --> 03:05:52,690
Thank you very much. Yogi: They’ve done it
during the camp, Shri Mataji.

846
03:05:52,891 --> 03:05:55,267
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Boy: From Switzerland.

847
03:05:55,468 --> 03:05:58,593
Shri Mataji: From where?
Boy: Switzerland.

848
03:05:58,794 --> 03:06:04,101
Shri Mataji: Oh, thank you. Now, everybody
need not give. See?

849
03:06:04,302 --> 03:06:10,919
First of all French centers, then all the
other centers, it’s going to be too much.

850
03:06:12,736 --> 03:06:18,385
You see, this is what? Gregoire: It comes
from France, Shri Mataji!

851
03:06:18,586 --> 03:06:22,127
Shri Mataji: Comes from France!
Gregoire: Yes!

852
03:06:22,328 --> 03:06:26,664
(A yogi says in French that it is a Swiss
gift bought in France.

853
03:06:26,865 --> 03:06:29,565
Then somebody replies that it is a French
gift bought in Switzerland)

854
03:06:29,765 --> 03:06:33,513
Shri Mataji: No no no, cannot be, this
cannot be, this is Swiss!

855
03:06:33,721 --> 03:06:37,541
Yogi: This is Saint Louis crystal - crystal
from Saint Louis.

856
03:06:37,742 --> 03:06:41,491
And maybe the watch is Swiss.
Shri Mataji: Oh, combination.

857
03:06:41,692 --> 03:06:43,280
Yogi: That’s a good combination,
Shri Mataji!

858
03:06:43,481 --> 03:06:49,966
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, but I mean, every
time Swiss people need not give Me presents.

859
03:06:50,167 --> 03:06:55,001
Thank you very much, it’s beautiful,
I needed one, very much,

860
03:06:55,202 --> 03:06:59,515
I really needed one. What’s that?

861
03:07:01,337 --> 03:07:06,046
For my bed!
Yogi: This is our..., Mother.

862
03:07:06,374 --> 03:07:09,695
Shri Mataji: Ah, now, how is the house
coming up?

863
03:07:09,896 --> 03:07:13,846
Well?
Yogi: This is it, Mother.

864
03:07:14,047 --> 03:07:18,290
Ah ah ah! Beautiful!

865
03:07:19,825 --> 03:07:26,709
Really? So kind of you! That’s the ashram!
Oh beautiful!

866
03:07:29,096 --> 03:07:34,829
Oh! Done so well, everything.
Yogi: Yes!

867
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:40,147
Beautiful, beautiful, what an ashram!

868
03:07:40,363 --> 03:07:44,561
I may settle down in Switzerland!

869
03:07:47,934 --> 03:07:52,158
Yogi: Shri Mataji, may this house stay
in your house,

870
03:07:52,359 --> 03:07:54,870
so that we get the protection of You
all the time.

871
03:07:55,071 --> 03:07:58,634
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you
very much.

872
03:08:09,323 --> 03:08:16,238
Beautiful, eh? How far is it now?
Started?

873
03:08:16,439 --> 03:08:19,634
Yogi: The floor’s basement is done already.
Shri Mataji: Oh oh!

874
03:08:19,835 --> 03:08:21,366
Other yogi: The concrete is put,
Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Good, good.

875
03:08:21,567 --> 03:08:23,614
Yogi: It’s going to be finished this week.

876
03:08:23,815 --> 03:08:26,300
...when You come on the seventh
of September.

877
03:08:26,501 --> 03:08:28,516
Shri Mataji: Oh, I... Yogi: When You come
to Switzerland, Shri Mataji,

878
03:08:28,717 --> 03:08:31,058
we’ll show You already the house half –
half finished.

879
03:08:31,259 --> 03:08:35,046
Shri Mataji: Good. See, what a miracle:

880
03:08:35,247 --> 03:08:39,882
this one we planned in five minutes,
didn’t we? Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

881
03:08:40,298 --> 03:08:45,315
Shri Mataji: Better show Mister Srivastava
to see how I planned it.

882
03:08:45,516 --> 03:08:50,049
They were all struggling with planning,
planning, planning:

883
03:08:51,543 --> 03:08:54,920
and really, in really five minutes.
Yogi: I’m sorry, Mother…

884
03:08:55,121 --> 03:09:01,901
Shri Mataji: Eh? No, no it’s all right,
see, everybody had to learn through that.

885
03:09:06,657 --> 03:09:09,084
What’s that? Now.
Guido: A present from Italy.

886
03:09:09,285 --> 03:09:15,138
Shri Mataji: Why, from Italy? I’ve not been
to Italy so far.

887
03:09:15,339 --> 03:09:19,238
Sso much, you see, it’s too much for Me.

888
03:09:27,349 --> 03:09:31,620
I don’t want to break it, it’s so nicely
done.

889
03:09:48,152 --> 03:09:49,898
That’s too much.
Guido: No, no, no.

890
03:09:50,099 --> 03:09:53,567
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, what, it’s too
much. It’s too much, just see, imagine.

891
03:09:53,775 --> 03:09:58,582
Just imagine, this is too much. How could
you give such a lot to Me?

892
03:09:58,783 --> 03:10:01,663
See this.

893
03:10:02,847 --> 03:10:06,890
It’s too much. Oh God.

894
03:10:07,821 --> 03:10:11,293
Are diamonds? These are diamonds?
Guido: Yes, yes, Shri Mataji.

895
03:10:11,494 --> 03:10:15,282
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I mean, I just
imagine, this is too much.

896
03:10:15,483 --> 03:10:19,077
Can you do that? Oh God.

897
03:10:19,342 --> 03:10:22,842
But you need money for your ashram!

898
03:10:23,043 --> 03:10:29,101
No, it’s too much, I mean, it’s too much
really.

899
03:10:30,734 --> 03:10:35,412
You need, definitely you need, isn’t it?

900
03:10:35,978 --> 03:10:40,363
Guido: We had to pay the great Architect,
who planned the ashram.

901
03:10:40,588 --> 03:10:44,532
Shri Mataji: Ah, this is for architectural
work!

902
03:10:46,570 --> 03:10:50,803
Everybody - everybody asked Me why did
You change the plans.

903
03:10:51,004 --> 03:10:55,624
So then I had to admit, I said:
“I’m the best planner”.

904
03:10:55,825 --> 03:10:58,906
Thank you very much, thank you,
it’s beautiful, it’s too much.

905
03:10:59,107 --> 03:11:03,322
Guido: This is for France.
Shri Mataji: Ah! This is the gratitude.

906
03:11:03,531 --> 03:11:07,987
Guido: This was taken the night You were
talking about the Atma and Jivatma,

907
03:11:08,195 --> 03:11:12,581
and the seven chakras are there, and just
the Void is…

908
03:11:12,782 --> 03:11:14,192
Shri Mataji: Really, from where do they
come in?

909
03:11:14,393 --> 03:11:16,248
Guido: standing in the water element.
From Volterra.

910
03:11:16,449 --> 03:11:22,113
Shri Mataji: Eh God, just imagine! Let Me
have a pair… just… from there.

911
03:11:22,314 --> 03:11:26,083
Guido: You were talking about koshas and -
Atma and Jivatma.

912
03:11:26,284 --> 03:11:30,598
Shri Mataji: Can you imagine such a thing.
Who did that?

913
03:11:30,799 --> 03:11:34,172
Guido: It’s Parvati.

914
03:11:37,433 --> 03:11:42,618
Shri Mataji: I’m surprised, yes!
Just imagine!

915
03:11:42,834 --> 03:11:49,923
Guido: All seven there are, the Gods,
the petals, from Mooladhara.

916
03:11:50,494 --> 03:11:52,028
Shri Mataji: Can you imagine!

917
03:11:52,229 --> 03:11:54,905
Guido: And You were talking about this
glass, saying that we have to become…

918
03:11:55,106 --> 03:11:59,915
Shri Mataji: And this is like a…
Guido: … pure, to reflect the Atma.

919
03:12:01,499 --> 03:12:07,589
Shri Mataji: I didn’t have anything
in My hand! Haven’t. Nothing.

920
03:12:10,279 --> 03:12:16,099
That’s like a Kundalini, is like.
Cannot be My bangles, were here.

921
03:12:16,300 --> 03:12:19,279
Guido: No, no, no, Shri Mataji, just You
were talking about this glass,

922
03:12:19,480 --> 03:12:26,092
and how we have to be like this water
to reflect the Atma.

923
03:12:26,293 --> 03:12:30,045
Shri Mataji: Yes, I tell you. Really!
Can’t believe it!

924
03:12:30,246 --> 03:12:34,896
Show this one, this is a remarkable
photograph, I must say.

925
03:12:35,534 --> 03:12:39,261
No no, just tell them, what you said.

926
03:12:40,269 --> 03:12:43,875
Seven chakras on My hand.

927
03:12:44,464 --> 03:12:50,264
There are seven chakras on My hand,
showing.

928
03:12:50,465 --> 03:12:56,119
Guido: Exactly at that time, Shri Mataji
was talking about Atma and Jivatma.

929
03:12:56,320 --> 03:13:01,395
And She was saying that Sahaja Yogis
have to be pure and transparent

930
03:13:01,596 --> 03:13:04,552
like that glass to reflect the Atma.

931
03:13:04,753 --> 03:13:13,685
And all the seven chakras are showing then,
in this picture, through the glass.

932
03:13:29,930 --> 03:13:34,585
Shri Mataji: What is this? Oh.

933
03:13:34,856 --> 03:13:37,465
Yogi: ...from Sudan.

934
03:13:37,666 --> 03:13:40,511
Shri Mataji: Sudan? Yogi: Yes, I've been
in Sudan for six years.

935
03:13:40,712 --> 03:13:44,491
Shri Mataji: I know. Have you finished with
Sudan? Yogi: Yes, I’ve finished with Sudan,

936
03:13:44,730 --> 03:13:46,709
so now I’m going to Madagascar.

937
03:13:46,910 --> 03:13:49,632
And I need Your blessings Mother,
to go to Madagascar.

938
03:13:49,833 --> 03:13:52,985
Shri Mataji: May God bless you. May God
bless you. I’ll be seeing you in Madras.

939
03:13:53,186 --> 03:13:55,844
Yogi: (unclear)
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

940
03:13:56,147 --> 03:14:01,079
Yogi: (unclear) Shri Mataji: Thank you
very much. Beautiful.

941
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:04,362
May God bless you. Hope to see you
in Madras.

942
03:14:04,563 --> 03:14:09,900
I’m going to Madras for a programme.
Do you know that dress-up Mr. Murthy?

943
03:14:10,101 --> 03:14:12,354
Yogi: I can find out, Mother. Shri Mataji:
Eh? Yogi: I can find out.

944
03:14:12,555 --> 03:14:16,706
Shri Mataji: I’ll find out. (Hindi)

945
03:14:19,293 --> 03:14:22,595
This is from Sudan he brought it for me.
Beautiful piece.

946
03:14:22,810 --> 03:14:25,280
And this is a perfume from his wife.

947
03:14:25,542 --> 03:14:30,139
Yogi: Mother, a little present from Spain.
Shri Mataji: Ah, ah, beautiful!

948
03:14:30,348 --> 03:14:36,761
Very beautiful, very, very. Thank you very
much. From Spain. Beautiful.

949
03:14:36,962 --> 03:14:39,200
Thank you.

950
03:14:53,336 --> 03:14:56,700
Yes. Have you given something
to Mr. Srivastava?

951
03:14:56,908 --> 03:15:00,116
Yogi: Yes, we did.
Shri Mataji: To eat?

952
03:15:05,849 --> 03:15:09,788
Look at these angels. What have you got?

953
03:15:09,989 --> 03:15:13,629
Ah, from all the children?
Girls: Yes.

954
03:15:13,830 --> 03:15:15,958
Shri Mataji: Children from where?
Girls: From Italy.

955
03:15:16,159 --> 03:15:18,826
Shri Mataji: Eh? Girls: From Italy.
Shri Mataji: From Italy!

956
03:15:19,027 --> 03:15:22,765
Thank you very much, thank you.

957
03:15:33,098 --> 03:15:37,646
Ah, look at that! Show them.

958
03:15:37,847 --> 03:15:44,405
This is from the school, look at that,
how beautiful they are!

959
03:15:58,988 --> 03:16:04,115
Yes, keep it carefully. Thank you.
It can go with the English.

960
03:16:04,362 --> 03:16:07,074
What this one is?

961
03:16:21,425 --> 03:16:23,520
Sorry.

962
03:16:31,825 --> 03:16:39,228
Ah, beautiful! The day of Raksha Bandhan,
from children!

963
03:16:56,104 --> 03:16:59,716
You must see this one: “uncle Guido
and uncle Leo

964
03:16:59,917 --> 03:17:04,298
giving the garland to Shri Mataji”.
This is the best part.

965
03:17:15,967 --> 03:17:17,920
Oh, thank you very much.

966
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:21,485
Yogi: Uncle Guido and uncle Leo giving
the garland to Shri Mataji.

967
03:17:21,686 --> 03:17:24,802
It was the legend of the joy/joint? Shri Mataji:
Is beautiful I mean, the idea is good,

968
03:17:25,003 --> 03:17:30,581
they have just put a photo in a line, like
that, this expression is very strong.

969
03:17:33,082 --> 03:17:35,577
 What’s that?
Yogini: Shri Mataji, this is from America.

970
03:17:35,778 --> 03:17:38,815
Shri Mataji: From America. Oh!

971
03:17:43,718 --> 03:17:46,702
What is that?

972
03:17:46,999 --> 03:17:50,149
Yogi: It’s a vase.
Shri Mataji: It’s a vase!

973
03:17:55,246 --> 03:18:02,857
Yogini: It's a white horse. Shri Mataji:
Ah, beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.

974
03:18:03,830 --> 03:18:08,222
It’s a very humble white horse.

975
03:18:10,156 --> 03:18:14,450
Beautiful. Thank you very much, thank you.

976
03:18:18,022 --> 03:18:22,593
Yogi: This is, these are photographs from
the holiday camp of the French children.

977
03:18:22,820 --> 03:18:26,297
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Thank you very
much.

978
03:18:29,152 --> 03:18:33,393
But I can see, I can see, I was trying
to just…

979
03:18:39,981 --> 03:18:44,524
Ah, very nice, it’s beautiful. Where did
they have it?

980
03:18:44,725 --> 03:18:48,807
Yogi: In Nantes. In a farm in Brittany.
Shri Mataji: Aha. Yogi: Nearby Nantes.

981
03:18:49,037 --> 03:18:52,763
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Yes.

982
03:18:53,334 --> 03:18:59,330
Oh, thank you very much, thank you.
Very good idea.

983
03:19:00,177 --> 03:19:03,702
Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is the first issue
of the German ... speaking

984
03:19:03,911 --> 03:19:07,319
Sahaja Yoga magazine, with all Your
puja speeches.

985
03:19:07,549 --> 03:19:11,373
… with Your blessings.
Shri Mataji: Ah. From where?

986
03:19:11,574 --> 03:19:16,865
Yogi: From German-speaking countries,
Germany and Austria, Switzerland.

987
03:19:29,778 --> 03:19:33,083
Shri Mataji: This is in German language.
Yogi: In German language, yes.

988
03:19:33,284 --> 03:19:36,203
Other yogi: But it’s done in Austria.

989
03:19:38,542 --> 03:19:42,171
Shri Mataji: Austrians are Germans,
aren’t they?

990
03:19:43,602 --> 03:19:45,493
You are Austrians. Other yogi
as above: The Germans are Austrians!

991
03:19:45,694 --> 03:19:48,686
Shri Mataji: That’s correct.

992
03:19:56,518 --> 03:20:05,801
Yes, you see, because, you know, you had
a Queen who ruled there,

993
03:20:06,002 --> 03:20:10,959
your Queen ruled in Germany; it was one
country, Prussia, isn’t it? Yes.

994
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:15,528
So it was one country; so we can say
all of them are Prussians.

995
03:20:15,729 --> 03:20:20,382
Pr is good: pr means ‘enlightened’.

996
03:20:20,583 --> 03:20:24,941
Pr-ussians, Prussians is a good idea.

997
03:20:27,610 --> 03:20:30,400
Thank you, thank you very much,
beautiful idea.

998
03:20:30,638 --> 03:20:34,553
I’ll see this. This should be…
is a good idea.

999
03:20:37,426 --> 03:20:42,006
Now, I hope – still? Wah wah wah.

1000
03:20:45,971 --> 03:20:50,609
Yogi: A painting from Vermeer.
Shri Mataji: Painting?

1001
03:20:50,810 --> 03:20:55,686
Yogi: Reproduction of a very famous
painting. Shri Mataji: What’s the name?

1002
03:20:55,887 --> 03:20:57,786
Yogi: Vermeer.
Shri Mataji: Vermeer.

1003
03:20:57,987 --> 03:21:01,183
Yogi: Same painter as we gave to You
in the last Puja. It’s “The Incoronation”.

1004
03:21:01,384 --> 03:21:05,020
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes. Yogi: Together.
Shri Mataji: Ha. That's good.

1005
03:21:05,221 --> 03:21:08,935
Just now everything is in Shoody Camp,
so we’ll see.

1006
03:21:09,136 --> 03:21:12,248
Beautiful. How detailed working,
I must say.

1007
03:21:12,449 --> 03:21:14,785
You see, these days the artists are
all lazy lumps,

1008
03:21:14,986 --> 03:21:22,385
they’ll just put a line and say it is art.
Let them have a look, beautiful.

1009
03:21:23,727 --> 03:21:27,606
Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is the ashram in…
(inaudible).

1010
03:21:27,883 --> 03:21:31,481
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Yogi: This is the ashram in… (inaudible).

1011
03:21:31,682 --> 03:21:34,463
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1012
03:21:36,773 --> 03:21:42,704
Other yogi: Shri Mataji, this is a smaller
present from Swiss for people to France.

1013
03:21:43,092 --> 03:21:45,689
Shri Mataji: Ah.

1014
03:21:49,893 --> 03:21:51,919
You brought the presents I gave you
to show them?

1015
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:56,262
We should have brought the presents, to
show them, that I gave you, both of you.

1016
03:21:56,487 --> 03:21:58,633
Yogi: Oh, yes. Shri Mataji: The leaders.
You have got it? Yogi: No.

1017
03:21:58,834 --> 03:22:01,221
Shri Mataji: No, all right.

1018
03:22:01,882 --> 03:22:05,685
Yes, we could show them later on.

1019
03:22:13,204 --> 03:22:18,571
Gavin, you must be tired now. You can
give it to somebody else.

1020
03:22:24,534 --> 03:22:27,781
Yogi (joking): So hot vibrations…

1021
03:22:32,606 --> 03:22:35,551
Shri Mataji: Could be…

1022
03:22:37,896 --> 03:22:40,707
This is true…

1023
03:22:54,224 --> 03:23:00,689
This is for fanning Me, sir. You have
to fan Me, that’s why.

1024
03:23:05,742 --> 03:23:11,478
Ah, beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you.

1025
03:23:11,733 --> 03:23:16,086
The right time right thing. Right time,
right thing.

1026
03:23:16,444 --> 03:23:23,812
Right time, right thing, very spontaneous.
Yes.

1027
03:23:25,710 --> 03:23:30,769
Beautiful. Because you had no fan,
so they brought one.

1028
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:34,404
(The French yogi mixes up the word “fan”
in French so that that it sounds like:

1029
03:23:34,605 --> 03:23:42,575
“They had no elephant for the puja and
now we have” – everybody laughs)

1030
03:23:45,198 --> 03:23:50,622
Shri Mataji: What’s he telling? Patrick: He
said, “They had no elephant for the puja…”

1031
03:23:50,902 --> 03:23:54,220
Shri Mataji: All right, take it.

1032
03:24:04,735 --> 03:24:09,419
Patrick: As Guido asked: “Do you feel
the cool breeze now, of our Mother?

1033
03:24:09,650 --> 03:24:12,012
Shri Mataji: I know, when I’m perspiring,
you are feeling cool breeze,

1034
03:24:12,213 --> 03:24:15,403
of that I’m very sure.

1035
03:24:20,268 --> 03:24:23,498
Yes, what is that now?

1036
03:24:24,501 --> 03:24:26,733
Yogi: Present from Belgium for the French
people.

1037
03:24:26,934 --> 03:24:31,648
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s beautiful!

1038
03:24:35,459 --> 03:24:38,689
This one is?
Yogi: Easter puja in Rome.

1039
03:24:42,013 --> 03:24:45,347
Shri Mataji: Belgium puja?
Yogi: No, Easter puja in Roma.

1040
03:24:45,548 --> 03:24:48,024
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
Yogi: In Italy.

1041
03:24:48,978 --> 03:24:51,726
Shri Mataji: This side.

1042
03:25:02,716 --> 03:25:05,297
Beautiful.

1043
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:12,912
Very beautiful. Very beautiful it is,
really.

1044
03:25:13,231 --> 03:25:16,250
Really, very beautiful photograph.

1045
03:25:17,300 --> 03:25:21,580
Very symmetrical, beautiful, beautiful.

1046
03:25:21,781 --> 03:25:25,498
This last time when we had puja?
This, in Easter?

1047
03:25:25,699 --> 03:25:28,857
Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Really?

1048
03:25:43,677 --> 03:25:47,566
Beautiful, very beautiful.

1049
03:25:52,915 --> 03:25:56,625
Yogi: This is of the havan of this year
on Sahastrara Day, in Alpe Motta.

1050
03:25:56,826 --> 03:26:00,247
Shri Mataji: In? Yogi: Alpe Motta.
Patrick: In Italy. Shri Mataji: In Italy.

1051
03:26:00,448 --> 03:26:03,754
Patrick: It’s a Havana, yes, during
the Sahastrara Day seminar in Italy.

1052
03:26:03,955 --> 03:26:06,301
Shri Mataji: Ah.

1053
03:26:16,108 --> 03:26:19,394
Beautiful! And what is there?

1054
03:26:23,766 --> 03:26:28,453
Beautiful it is, isn’t it? What dimensions
they have taken.

1055
03:26:28,654 --> 03:26:34,170
All the deities are sitting here, and
blessing them.

1056
03:26:34,849 --> 03:26:38,160
May God bless you. Beautiful.

1057
03:26:40,101 --> 03:26:47,121
Yes. Arneau: Shri Mataji, just would like
to show You the poster we put in Geneva…

1058
03:26:47,322 --> 03:26:53,287
… of Geneva for the exhibition.
And it was very nice.

1059
03:26:55,680 --> 03:27:00,017
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful.
Arneau: It’s huge. It’s bigger than…

1060
03:27:00,218 --> 03:27:03,249
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Arneau It's bigger than...

1061
03:27:03,450 --> 03:27:05,902
Shri Mataji:  But they won't have
an exhibition to Shri Ganesh!

1062
03:27:06,103 --> 03:27:09,143
Arneau: I mean, no Shri Mataji, absolutely
not. On the contrary,

1063
03:27:09,344 --> 03:27:13,713
people at the place of the exhibition, they
congratulated us for the posters.

1064
03:27:13,914 --> 03:27:16,649
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. That’s good that.
Arneau: It’s quite unusual in Geneva,

1065
03:27:16,850 --> 03:27:20,728
I must say that these are a lot
of French, Shri Mataji.

1066
03:27:22,750 --> 03:27:28,659
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. It’s very nice.
Beautiful.

1067
03:27:29,645 --> 03:27:33,870
Very remarkable. Very balanced.

1068
03:27:34,149 --> 03:27:37,229
The French yogi explains: The deities
in the history of spiritual evolution –

1069
03:27:37,430 --> 03:27:40,458
exhibition by Sahaja Yoga.
Shri Mataji: Who has drawn that?

1070
03:27:40,659 --> 03:27:44,447
Arneau: This is Pascal, and Richard and
Christian, there were three of them.

1071
03:27:44,648 --> 03:27:47,981
Shri Mataji: Very nice. It’s beautiful.
Really.

1072
03:27:50,604 --> 03:27:55,979
Now, I hope the list is over, and I…

1073
03:28:08,481 --> 03:28:12,044
Yogi: What would you like to do,
Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: I’ll go home,

1074
03:28:12,245 --> 03:28:15,647
but the food is brought here. Will you,
can you eat it there?

1075
03:28:15,848 --> 03:28:17,991
Yogi: We can eat there. There is a time
to eat for You and Mr C.P.

1076
03:28:18,192 --> 03:28:19,823
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogi: But if You want
we'll go to the hotel.

1077
03:28:20,024 --> 03:28:22,968
Shri Mataji: You would like to have it
there, I know. Yogi: Yes.

1078
03:28:23,169 --> 03:28:26,399
Shri Mataji: So we’ll go back, let us,
so the food can go with us,

1079
03:28:26,614 --> 03:28:30,422
they can heat it and give it to us there.
Yogi: Yes, good.

1080
03:28:31,185 --> 03:28:36,339
Shri Mataji: But I also, you know – puja
means My situation is bad.

1081
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:38,889
May God bless you.

1082
03:28:53,330 --> 03:28:56,561
There’s a sweater also.

1083
03:28:59,161 --> 03:29:02,091
The sari, sort of lots of things.

1084
03:29:24,269 --> 03:29:26,813
May God bless you.

1085
03:29:27,014 --> 03:29:29,240
Don’t go in the sun now.

1086
03:29:29,441 --> 03:29:32,551
Today it’s horrible, I mean, one should not
go in the sun.

1087
03:29:36,647 --> 03:29:41,052
(It was?) good. Very good.

1088
03:29:43,548 --> 03:29:46,478
You see, you’ll have to have...

1089
03:29:47,282 --> 03:29:52,284
I can’t, it’s too much. I’m just shaking.

1090
03:30:06,303 --> 03:30:08,319
All right.

1091
03:30:11,381 --> 03:30:16,603
You need to be very courageous to do
the puja.

1092
03:30:17,632 --> 03:30:20,062
May God bless you.

1093
03:30:23,194 --> 03:30:26,830
Thank you for all the presents.
