00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,446
Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule, India
December 25, 2001

2
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:31,101
Nice to see so many Sahaja yogis coming here

3
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:35,030
during the Christmas Puja.

4
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:42,901
Christianity has spread all over the world,

5
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:48,764
 and there are so many so-called Christians

6
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:53,587
who say they follow Christ –

7
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,653
 I don’t know from which angle.

8
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:09,023
 Christ was the embodiment of Paramchaitanya.

9
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:14,899
He was Omkara. He was Shri Ganesha.

10
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:25,029
And those
who follow Him have to be very different people.

11
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:32,047
But always happens in every religion

12
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:42,016
that they go at random into the opposite direction,

13
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:45,616
completely opposite.

14
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:55,584
The essence of Christ’s life was detachment and sacrifice.

15
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:04,260
 For a person who is detached, there’s nothing like sacrifice.

16
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:09,832
 He sees his life as just a drama.

17
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:14,554
 Such a great personality came on this earth

18
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:19,967
 and created this so-called Christian religion,

19
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:27,837
which has gone into wars, all kinds of hypocritical thing,

20
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:33,297
and now the people are discovering about it.

21
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:43,856
He stood for truth, and Christians don’t know what is the truth is.

22
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:50,652
The truth is that you are the spirit,

23
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:54,786
 and you have to become the spirit.

24
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:03,611
He’s the one who has talked about second birth, of realization.

25
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:11,671
But they have forgotten about what He said,
what they have to achieve.

26
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:19,215
It’s such a funny thing that all these great people came on this Earth

27
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,694
 and created a proper religion for our ascent,

28
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:33,886
 and I don’t know how people have become so stupid

29
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:44,902
with the teachings of the so-called, their masters.

30
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:56,383
 It’s all money-oriented.
Apart from that, it’s not standing on the truth.

31
00:29:57,836 --> 00:30:05,793
 I think this is the second crucifixion of this religion.

32
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:20,098
There’s no religion which is following really
 their principles as been described.

33
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:28,003
 I don’t know how they manage to twist the truth in this manner,

34
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:34,154
 just to make some money or some fuss.

35
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:41,530
Such a ritualistic stuff is going on in the name of Christ.

36
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:53,022
Though they have faltered so many times and they had experience

37
00:30:53,233 --> 00:31:02,790
of such a bad influence on the world, to reaction

38
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:13,307
we don’t know why such a roundabout things come up,

39
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:20,139
 and people accept it, they just accept.

40
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:23,017
You take any religion.

41
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:30,646
These days, Islam is talking, I don’t know of what.

42
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,414
There are two important things in the life of Mohammed Sahib.

43
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:43,094
The first one is called as miraj

44
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:49,052
which is nothing but the awakening of the kundalini, absolutely clearly.

45
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:55,049
And the second one He has talked about is jihad.

46
00:31:55,533 --> 00:32:05,683
 “Jihad” means killing your bad things, killing your bad nature,

47
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:09,404
 killing all the shadripus within you.

48
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:14,348
It doesn’t mean that you become a Muslim and kill yourself.

49
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,705
It’s the stupidest thing to do.

50
00:32:17,864 --> 00:32:26,569
Did you become Mussulman just to kill yourself and commit suicide?

51
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:35,418
 Calling it as a ritual, they are saying

52
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:41,012
that by this you will go to Cennet, into the Heavens.

53
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:48,798
How can you go? As Muslims they are not religious – not at all.

54
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:58,477
 And then by killing, these sinful people, how will you go

55
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:04,666
 to the Heavens where you’d have enjoyment of Cennet?

56
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:14,323
 There’s no reasoning.
But all these maullanas first of all have finished their education –

57
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:29,936
 have finished their education.
 They do not educate themselves at all.

58
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:37,690
 So they have no idea in this world where are they standing,
what is their position.

59
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:44,899
Some few are educated, but they are also lost

60
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:49,725
with the idea of having power on these people.

61
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:59,093
It’s such a shameful thing to do in the name of God
and in the name of spirituality.

62
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:13,119
Now, our duty is to tell them what is the truth.

63
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:20,649
Our duty is, bring them to the proper path of spirituality,

64
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,903
because they are all lost.
Christians are lost, Muslim are lost,

65
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:32,083
Hindus are lost; all of them are lost people.

66
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:37,987
They have no idea as to what their religion professed

67
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:41,713
 and what they are supposed to do.

68
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:47,321
Ultimately Christ was crucified,

69
00:34:47,763 --> 00:34:53,113
so you can see how when there was truth,

70
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:58,498
untruth tried to finish it off; they couldn’t bear it.

71
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:02,537
We have example of Socrates.

72
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:07,335
What was the need to kill him? But they killed him.

73
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:15,201
In this way, so far, we know in the past all

74
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:22,547
the people who are pivotal for the truth are being finished,

75
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:26,659
because they don’t want the truth.

76
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:33,955
 They are following some religion
because they can have power over other people:

77
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:37,653
 religion that they have made.

78
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:50,169
Miraj is a kundalini awakening, and they say that miraj will never take place.

79
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,989
Very good! So many of you have got realization.

80
00:35:56,408 --> 00:36:02,798
You have got your vibrations and cool breeze,

81
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:07,007
 which is described in Koran,

82
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:14,187
 that you should feel the cool breeze.
But who can tell the Muslims?

83
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:18,994
You talk something – they’ll come and cut your throat, that’s all.

84
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:26,046
You will go to jihad.
So it’s such a stupid thing they are doing,

85
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:30,781
 and in these modern times as we see,

86
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:44,228
people have crossed all the maryadas, all the things of a religion.

87
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:54,776
Before I went to America, and I was surprised
how they have forgotten of our morality.

88
00:36:55,054 --> 00:37:03,436
They have no sense of morality.
And they are selling it in the market, making money out of it.

89
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:12,398
On the contrary, these Muslims – specially there is a class called Vahhabis –

90
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:18,369
 these people are saying that women are the one

91
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:27,637
who spoil your morality, and so hide them,
they should be covered.

92
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:33,622
Any woman who was wearing white chappels in Afghanistan,

93
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:38,825
they were beating her. “Kill them.”

94
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:47,665
 And so many people in India,
specially in north, have taken to Islamic culture,

95
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:52,220
 and they really ill-treat women in the north.

96
00:37:52,371 --> 00:38:00,377
 I was married in the north,
and I know how they have been unkind to women.

97
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:05,227
So north of India is already contaminated by this,

98
00:38:05,402 --> 00:38:12,373
 and the south is contaminated by the fanatic Hindus.

99
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:25,286
All kinds of rituals, worst type,
bestowed upon only on women, are followed in the south.

100
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:33,680
 They will shave the head of a woman, make her go round a temple,

101
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:42,708
pour water on her and she is just tumbling around, she is not walking,

102
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:48,507
 and they go on putting water on her – I’ve seen it Myself.

103
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:56,895
We have sati, is of the killing of the women after the death of their husband.

104
00:38:57,264 --> 00:39:01,341
This is something no one can understand.

105
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:08,201
Why put all the dharma on women, and why not on the men?

106
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:16,290
But one thing good, that Hindu religion has now become so much out-of-date

107
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:22,948
 that you can correct all these things.
So many things have been corrected in My own lifetime.

108
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:32,282
 I was surprised, how could they do it?
 But in Muslims and Islamism you cannot correct them.

109
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:42,610
 Such horrible things they do to their women,
and whenever you try to help them, it’s impossible.

110
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:49,819
For example, I started a place for the women who are

111
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:55,680
left out in world alone, who are like orphans, who have children.

112
00:39:55,885 --> 00:40:02,885
 I was surprised, most of them are Muslims,
and they have eight to ten children each.

113
00:40:03,227 --> 00:40:11,618
 So now we have to make an orphanage also.
This is what they are producing out of their religion.

114
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:15,370
You can see this around you.

115
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:21,587
Even Hindus have a funny system of widowhood.

116
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:25,468
If they make a woman widow, it’s terrible,

117
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:32,724
and they are poor things, some of them; and quite a lot of them are living in Vrindavan.

118
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,359
I was told that they get one rupee per day.

119
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:43,949
 And what do they do? They sing bhajans.

120
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:48,786
 In one rupee, how can you live in this country?

121
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:56,526
They are good at creating so many beggars and beggar-women.

122
00:40:57,804 --> 00:41:04,634
If that is the religion, better not have it.
We have had enough of this.

123
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:11,130
All kinds of ritualism through this Brahmanism.

124
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:16,069
These  brahmins are absolutely good-for-nothing people.

125
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:23,336
 Those who try to teach religion have to be something of a great level.

126
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,924
So in Sahaja Yoga you give up everything,

127
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:39,400
 because this is all nothing but mud,
and in the mud you will be finished.

128
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:46,536
You have to tell people about it.
What are they going to do?

129
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:55,390
 They have misused the religion for all kinds of bad thing.

130
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:05,014
Like in England if somebody dies, they must have champagne.

131
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:11,178
When they go for the burial they must have champagne.

132
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:17,863
I was surprised: how is it they are going to have champagne for this?

133
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:25,710
And how is it, out of religion you say, all their priests also drink? – no question.

134
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:32,240
One priest came to Sahaja Yoga, I was very happy.

135
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:37,387
 But he said, “I’ll come to Sahaj, but I will not give up drinking.”

136
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:38,967
I said, “Why?”

137
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:43,279
“Because it’s written in the Bible that you must drink.”
Accha! I didn’t know.

138
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:50,478
How could it be? How could Christ say that you should drink?

139
00:42:50,842 --> 00:42:57,654
He was not only a realized Self, but He was Realization Himself.”

140
00:42:57,852 --> 00:43:03,514
He said, “He has said it. Whatever You may say, He has said it.”

141
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:05,370
“Where?”

142
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:09,247
He said, “He went to one wedding. All right.

143
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:16,083
In that wedding, He made wine for the people.”
But He did not.

144
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:24,322
He went there, and in such a short time
He just put His hand in the water

145
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:31,487
and it started tasting like grape juice.

146
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:35,845
And grape juice has the same word “wine” in Hebrew language.

147
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:41,914
 I said, “I can do that. That doesn’t mean I like people to drink.”

148
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:47,547
I mean, who can say such a nonsense?

149
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:57,100
It is awareness which is important, chetana is important.

150
00:43:57,473 --> 00:44:04,832
And if you spoil your awareness, how can you be Sahaja yogis?

151
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:12,256
 It was impossible to tell them that you cannot drink.

152
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,206
But drinking even in India has become very common.

153
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:26,915
 It is all against Christianity, it’s against Hinduism, against Islam.

154
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:35,407
 And though it is written down in Koran
 “Don’t drink,” they drink, they all drink.

155
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:41,960
 And instead of following the religion,
they have become the greatest sinner.

156
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:47,458
Is that what Christ wanted them to do?

157
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:57,192
You have to be pure people. Nirmala tattwam you must have.

158
00:44:57,472 --> 00:45:04,588
That’s what it is. Also I told you a story about Shalivahana,

159
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:09,926
who met Christ in Kashmir.

160
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:15,493
And he asked Christ about His name
and His country. He says,

161
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:19,789
 “I come from a country where people are malecch.”

162
00:45:20,003 --> 00:45:28,699
 “Malecch” means those who have a desire for mala, for filth.

163
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:37,064
So he told Him, “Why don’t You go
and teach them Nirmala tattwam?” Shalivahana said.

164
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:41,145
That is what Nirmal tattwam you have got,

165
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:54,180
 which purifies you, which cleanses you,
which gives you joy, happiness and the truth.

166
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:58,669
 This is what you should ask for.

167
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:04,748
Otherwise it’s all darkness, you don’t see the light.

168
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:10,816
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

169
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:18,204
you cannot see light of truth; and you have to take the light of truth.

170
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:24,872
But after that, what you have to do?

171
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:30,186
You have to give it to others, you have to transform others.

172
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:36,559
You have worked very hard for it. And sometimes I am surprised

173
00:46:36,651 --> 00:46:45,828
how people who are doing such a good work are so humble and so good.

174
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:51,858
How have they achieved it, I can’t understand.

175
00:46:52,551 --> 00:47:00,569
 Of course there are some who are money-oriented,
who are power-oriented,

176
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:04,133
but these things do not give joy.

177
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:15,425
 What gives joy is your inner light of truth

178
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:19,541
which you have, all of you have, as you know.

179
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:28,057
 You all have experienced.
But I would say this experience has to be given to others –

180
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,946
 it’s not only for you – given to as many people possible.

181
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:40,855
But how many do that? How many people do that?

182
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:47,870
We have also Sikh community. They came to Sahaj,

183
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:53,188
but they said, “We cannot worship Goddess.”
I said, “Why?”

184
00:47:53,366 --> 00:48:04,992
 Surprised at it,
because Shri Guru Nanak has talked about the Goddess, the Devi.

185
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:15,885
The first sentence of His book is “Adya.”
“Adya” is the Adi Shakti.

186
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:26,413
And for this if the Sikhs stupidly say,
then why do they have a Chandigarh?

187
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:34,747
 They’re so stupid also, nothing to really compare.

188
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,809
Now, you have to understand, have you given up all that nonsense or not in your lives,

189
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:48,809
or are you all sticking onto the same? That is very important.

190
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:56,254
As long as you are sticking onto the same, there will be a problem.

191
00:48:56,492 --> 00:49:01,077
Sahaja Yoga does so much. I was surprised,

192
00:49:01,264 --> 00:49:06,978
 in America there are three hundred Sahaja yogis,
nothing happened to them.

193
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:18,420
Some were on the tower, some were on the street,
all of them were there and nothing has happened to them.

194
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:22,497
Some of them said that “Somebody told us inside,

195
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:31,289
told us inside that ‘run away’ and we started running in the other direction.

196
00:49:31,618 --> 00:49:36,844
” Some were delayed; I don’t know how, all these three hundreds.

197
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:52,206
But such a devil of these people who are thinking of destroying
 the whole world are coming round.

198
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:58,893
This is the reason I went to America, and I told them that this war will be over

199
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:06,178
before Diwali, and it ended; before Diwali this war will be over, and it ended.

200
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:13,432
What a stupid thing to think they can destroy the creation of God like this.

201
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:21,190
Who are they? How have they got the right to destroy the world?

202
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:27,920
 But that is what is a human nonsense.

203
00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:34,016
Christ came on this Earth, He worked for a long time

204
00:50:34,183 --> 00:50:38,863
and He was to be crucified, so He got crucified.

205
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:45,321
But crucifixion is not our glory. Our glory is His resurrection.

206
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:51,702
That  was resurrected, no doubt.

207
00:50:51,909 --> 00:50:57,906
To say that it’s not possible and all that – who are you to say that?

208
00:50:58,136 --> 00:51:04,413
 What do you know about spirituality?
What do you know what can happen to a person

209
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:11,509
who is spiritual, spiritually equipped, what can work out in Him?

210
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:18,728
Whatever we know about human beings,
we try to draw conclusions which are all wrong.

211
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,397
See in your life.

212
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:27,945
There are so many miracles in the lives of Sahaja yogis,

213
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:32,603
  and they – I told somebody that “You’d better compile them.”

214
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:40,119
So he said, “Within one month all those letters have come up to my head.”
 In one month!

215
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:43,354
I said, “Forget it, don’t write.”

216
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:49,181
 It’s not one or two; from all over the world people are writing.

217
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:56,981
But those who are intellectuals are very difficult.

218
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:04,059
It’s impossible to put this into their heads.

219
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:09,198
So whatever is possible, we have to do our maximum,

220
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:12,794
put our attention to people who want it.

221
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:21,817
 Now in India it has gone to into jails,
 it has gone into schools and everywhere.

222
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:26,542
 And somebody told Me the other day that even in a Catholic church

223
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,856
they have started taking to Sahaja Yoga;

224
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,088
I don’t know what’s wrong in their heads and how they have managed.

225
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:42,201
But that’s how Sahaja Yoga is spreading. But it has to spread much more.

226
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:48,260
You have to, all of you individually should go round and work it out,

227
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:53,281
and talk about it. But Sahaja yogis are little shy.

228
00:52:54,556 --> 00:53:01,452
Once I was going by plane, and one lady was very, very hot.

229
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:07,393
 So I asked her what guru she follows, she told Me the name.

230
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:13,729
I was surprised that she didn’t know anything about spirituality.

231
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:21,522
And these people have huge houses and big temples, everything,

232
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:28,152
and she was telling Me the praise of her guru.
I thought, “She is very shameless.

233
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:34,532
She hasn’t got anything in her, she’s so very hot,
 and she’s talking about it.”

234
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:40,206
But Sahaja yogis won’t. I was surprised,
why Sahaja yogis don’t talk about it?

235
00:53:40,768 --> 00:53:45,662
But the other day I had gone with somebody in the market

236
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:49,501
 and I had a Sahaja yogi with him, and I was surprised,

237
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:56,078
he started telling them about Me, and he started giving them realization.

238
00:53:56,244 --> 00:54:02,555
 And they were very happy about it. Everywhere you go you have neighbors,

239
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:09,698
you go to markets, everywhere you should go and talk about it.

240
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:16,519
 Like they sing these carols – we should also have bhajans and things

241
00:54:16,658 --> 00:54:20,549
 to tell other people, we have to tell them.

242
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:27,008
Why are you so shy? This shyness is not going to help Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:33,221
So please see that you try to give realizations to others.

244
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:38,766
 You have powers; have faith in yourself.
I think they lack in faith

245
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:44,533
 or whatever it is, there are very few people who come out and do it.

246
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:51,003
 Italy I have seen, and also Austria, Australia;

247
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:57,016
Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot because of their conviction

248
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:03,285
 that we have to give others what we have. We have to share it.

249
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:10,014
From the life of Christ one has to understand His sacrifice.

250
00:55:11,002 --> 00:55:18,949
It’s such a lot of sacrifice – to be crucified like that, with the thieves.

251
00:55:19,298 --> 00:55:25,023
 But He did it. In the same way when you all people

252
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:32,237
 want to do Sahaja Yoga work, you shouldn’t think, “What will happen to my grandfather,

253
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:39,793
what will happen to my grandmother?” I mean, whatever letters I get are all about this.

254
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:44,733
It’s very funny. They are only worried about some relations,

255
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:48,802
they are not worried about the relations all over the world even.

256
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:54,495
Worried about the wife or children: I get only letters like this.

257
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:59,045
 Nobody writes to Me that you have given realizations to so many.

258
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:09,775
 They never write how they have been able to achieve
spreading of Sahaja Yoga. o one writes – very surprising.

259
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:12,864
You have to tell Me.

260
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:21,053
I hope you all people understand the importance of spreading Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:26,391
 If you don’t do that, you are absolutely useless.

262
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:31,617
The greatest thing for Me, as you have so many lights here,

263
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,400
we should have many more Sahaja yogis all over the world.

264
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:42,485
If you want to change this world and if you want to avoid all the

265
00:56:42,621 --> 00:56:50,222
 trials and tribulations of the useless life they are leading,
 you have to save them.

266
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:54,966
You have to salvage them. That’s your job,

267
00:56:55,078 --> 00:57:02,078
that’s what you have to pay for Sahaja Yoga –
not for yourself, not for yourself.

268
00:57:02,388 --> 00:57:11,020
 Don’t get worried about yourself. If you read the letters I get, you’ll get disgusted.

269
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:33,946
Now, some other kind of letters I get, that they want to marry – all right.

270
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:41,074
There are many girls who claim that
“We have been applying for four years, we couldn’t get married.”

271
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:47,031
 Firstly you must know, out of proportion women are there.
They are very good.

272
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,467
Say, if there are forty boys,

273
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:55,400
there would be at least a hundred-and-twenty,
or maybe even a hundred -and-fifty girls.

274
00:57:55,607 --> 00:58:00,733
 So now, whom should we marry those girls? Just think of it.

275
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:06,329
 But they write letters of complaint that
“We have applied four times.”

276
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:12,444
We can’t, we can’t help it.
So you go outside, marry anywhere you feel like.

277
00:58:12,566 --> 00:58:18,214
Or else you wait and see, and dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga.

278
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:22,672
It’s a very difficult thing when they go on complaining

279
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:28,120
that “I should be married, and I haven’t got married as yet.”

280
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:31,712
Marriage was never our idea.

281
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,551
But then we had to allow marriages.

282
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,992
And now it has become the main issue with everyone.

283
00:58:40,223 --> 00:58:47,157
Either they are not married;
if they are married, they are not happy;

284
00:58:47,498 --> 00:58:51,375
 if they are divorced, they must be married again.

285
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:57,162
All sorts of things and complications, for which I am not prepared.

286
00:58:57,337 --> 00:59:00,055
Sahaja Yoga is not for that.

287
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,939
If your marriage is not successful, it’s not My job.

288
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:11,397
And if goes on, we’ll have to stop marriages.

289
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:16,714
I don’t want you to write all these things to Me.

290
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:23,008
It shows how poor you are in Sahaja Yoga.

291
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:29,592
Why not write to Me how many people you have given realization?

292
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:33,868
That will make Me happy;

293
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:40,876
instead of complaining about your wife and – that’s not My concern.

294
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:47,643
And as it came, we have married you; if you cannot carry on, it’s your duty.

295
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:56,767
And this is what is the snag of Sahaja Yoga.

296
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:04,709
 In every religious movement there have been so many wrong things,

297
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:12,217
while in Sahaja Yoga I think marriages is a very big hurdle.

298
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:18,487
 Moreover, boys don’t come;
because in India, very easy to marry boys,

299
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:26,438
you can also get money, this, that.
But girls, there are five times more than the boys.

300
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:32,657
Boys don’t want to marry. They’ll have their own marriages,
though they are Sahaja yogis.

301
01:00:33,836 --> 01:00:41,123
So I can’t understand why, in Sahaja Yoga also after coming to realization,

302
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:46,511
 to them marriage is a very important issue.

303
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:53,710
What is most important is that how many people you give realization.

304
01:00:55,326 --> 01:00:58,376
That is your life.

305
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:05,981
 If a lotus is there it will open, but it must give fragrance.

306
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:11,114
 Even the lotus has a responsibility.

307
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:17,803
Then what about you people? I’m not saying you get crucified like Christ – no.

308
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:26,121
 I said you enjoy your life, you have peace and stability, balance.

309
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:33,502
But at the same time you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

310
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:39,969
 This is what is your job now. Your job is not important;

311
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:46,143
only this is important, how many people you give realization.

312
01:01:46,389 --> 01:01:52,134
It’s very, very difficult, because they have made

313
01:01:52,348 --> 01:02:00,133
 a mess of all the great incarnations, all those great Sufis and saints.

314
01:02:00,252 --> 01:02:04,370
 But at least you people don’t do that.

315
01:02:04,478 --> 01:02:12,171
So please try to think whom can you give realization,
to whom you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

316
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:14,659
You have to spread out.

317
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:20,666
And next time I hope, I hear from you how
many people you have given realization.

318
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:28,940
That is the greatest justification for the crucifixion of Christ,

319
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:33,806
 for His birth, for His coming on this earth, His Agnya.

320
01:02:34,076 --> 01:02:37,959
And if you have given realization, they have crossed the Agnya,

321
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:44,089
 they have gone beyond, and they are in Sahasrara.

322
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:50,602
So in Sahaja Yoga you understand everything. It’s very easy to understand.

323
01:02:50,785 --> 01:02:56,732
 Sahaja Yoga is the simplest thing to understand – but after realization.

324
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:04,549
So you have to go round and see
how many people you can give realization.

325
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:14,092
 Everything is all right, all your worshipping is all right,
your puja is all right;

326
01:03:14,513 --> 01:03:22,028
but what is most important is
how many people you have given realization.

327
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:27,272
 I would like to know how many people have given.

328
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:34,788
And specially with ladies. Ladies are rather weak in giving realization.

329
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:39,152
They can do a lot, I know, they can.

330
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:47,058
After all, I am also a woman. But somehow I find the ladies in Sahaja Yoga

331
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:54,524
 are not of a level. They can do a lot, a lot,

332
01:03:54,692 --> 01:03:59,881
but somehow they don’t understand the importance of their life.

333
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:03,309
 You are very important.

334
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:08,239
How many people there are who have got realizations?

335
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:17,221
There were so many Sufis who got realization, they write poetry – finished.

336
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:23,895
There were so many saints who did so much, wrote so many things.

337
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:32,437
 In India we had so many saints; they wrote all these things, people will read them,

338
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:40,605
but nothing happens. You have, you have the art of giving realization.

339
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:44,658
You know about kundalini, you know all about it.

340
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:48,670
Go ahead and talk to people.

341
01:04:48,794 --> 01:04:57,565
I was alone when I started Sahaja Yoga, and I am a woman.

342
01:04:57,746 --> 01:05:02,766
So what about you? There’s a now challenge for all of you.

343
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,832
How many people have you made Sahaja yogis?

344
01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:12,242
Even in your family people are not Sahaja yogis,
 your daughter is not, your son is not.

345
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:18,074
 So what’s the use of singing glory to Christ?

346
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:26,171
 If you are singing glory to Him,
you must make people cross their Agnya.

347
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:32,764
 He’s so highly placed within us, but you have never respected Him,

348
01:05:33,124 --> 01:05:40,325
that such a highly placed personality you have crossed over,
so why not others?

349
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:48,226
Let us see from today’s Puja

350
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,750
how much determination you have.

351
01:05:53,350 --> 01:06:01,175
You should know that a Goddess doesn’t come with your own demands,

352
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:06,695
She comes on Her own. She has Her own timing.

353
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:12,394
But if you are people in majority

354
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:19,550
who have really become saints and making others saintly, then I am for you.

355
01:06:19,716 --> 01:06:22,087
 Otherwise I am available to you:

356
01:06:22,238 --> 01:06:26,312
you can have My vibrations, you can have My pujas,

357
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:29,626
 all these things are permitted, no doubt.

358
01:06:29,746 --> 01:06:37,409
But for that you are only capable,

359
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:43,115
you are only entitled for that if you are doing Sahaja Yoga,

360
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:48,382
if you are spreading Sahaja Yoga,
if you are giving to others;

361
01:06:48,865 --> 01:06:54,857
 then only you will be considered really

362
01:06:55,134 --> 01:07:01,446
capable of receiving the vibrations of the Goddess.

363
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:07,611
In some countries if it is so much powerful,

364
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:12,196
why not with your country, with your neighborhood,

365
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:17,556
with your friends, with your relations is possible?

366
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:22,875
So tonight you have to decide

367
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:29,395
that you are going to dedicate yourself in giving it to others –

368
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:34,749
 it’s very joy-giving – and talking about Sahaja Yoga.

369
01:07:35,254 --> 01:07:37,455
May God bless you.
