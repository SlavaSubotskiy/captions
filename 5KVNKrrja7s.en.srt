00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:31,469
Sahastrara Puja
Cabella Ligure 7.5.2000

2
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:20,169
Thirty years back, when Sahastrara was opened,

3
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:24,955
 I found darkness all over.

4
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:29,220
People were so ignorant.

5
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:36,264
They had no awareness  what they have to find.

6
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:45,717
Of course, I found they wanted to find something that was unknown,

7
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:52,311
but they did not know what was unknown, what they have to find.

8
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:59,647
And they were extremely ignorant people, about themselves,

9
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:07,032
and about their surroundings, and about the aim of their life.

10
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:16,201
I didn’t know how to start the topic with them.

11
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:28,538
When the Sahastrara was opened, I thought of trying

12
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:38,877
Self-realisation only on one lady: she was an old lady.

13
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:45,107
And there was another lady who also started to come up.

14
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:56,114
This old lady got her Realisation, and then the another lady who was much younger

15
00:11:56,941 --> 00:12:03,592
she told me that she gets fits and she gets possessed.

16
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,691
“Oh my God!” I said, “how will I give her Realisation?”

17
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:17,499
But somehow she got cured very fast and she also got her Realisation.

18
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,482
It’s a very unknown knowledge.

19
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:27,305
Also, human beings, in their ego, do not want to accept

20
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:35,098
that they are not yet complete, that they have to have their Realisation.

21
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:45,685
Also their style of life was such that they had no time for themselves.

22
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:56,212
I found it very difficult to convince people that you must take your Self-realisation,

23
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,954
because they thought it is something imaginary,

24
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:07,415
it is very far-fetched, and they only believed in ‘gurus’

25
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:14,526
who would say alright, “Do this much of rituals, karmakand."

26
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:16,323
That’s all!

27
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:20,035
And they were doing all kinds of rituals

28
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:24,130
with the ‘kind’ guidance of their gurus,

29
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:29,283
without knowing that you have to first know yourself,

30
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:37,210
which is said by all the great incarnations, all the saints – clearly!

31
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:45,908
It is not that it was only my idea that people should get their Self-realisation

32
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:50,258
 but it was the idea of all those people.

33
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:56,510
They said, one after another, for centuries, that “Seek yourself."

34
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,268
Even Christ said “Know thyself”.

35
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:03,811
Mohammed Saheb said the same, Nanak Saheb said the same.

36
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:09,451
But nobody tried to know that these rituals are not

37
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:14,073
the end of life, they will not serve the purpose,

38
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,699
 and that you have to have Realisation.

39
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,645
So those two ladies, only, got Self-realisation,

40
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:30,747
and with that I thought, “Let’s go to the seashore."

41
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:36,338
And about thirty people came with me.

42
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:44,171
And they were talking in a very funny manner as to:

43
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:50,020
How they can get Self-realisation?
They don’t deserve it.

44
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:55,416
They have not been very good people.

45
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:58,479
All kinds of things: condemning themselves!

46
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:04,584
And in that lot I got about twelve people, altogether,

47
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,968
 inclusive of these two ladies who got Realisation [before].

48
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:28,412
This is a sign that the movement of knowing yourself is very, very slow,

49
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:36,426
 and people don’t understand why they should know themselves.

50
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:43,234
I was quite disappointed, because nobody understood me.

51
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:49,441
But one day it so happened that, in one of the programmes,

52
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:54,512
one lady came: she was possessed,

53
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:59,597
and she started talking in Sanskrit language.

54
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:05,980
She was just a maid-servant, and everybody was surprised

55
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:10,412
and she said, “You don’t know who she is!”

56
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:18,414
And then she started describing me from the Saundarya Lahari.

57
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,287
I was wondering, “What’s the matter with this lady?”

58
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:26,426
Like a man she spoke. Her voice was like a man.

59
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:29,807
People may believe it or not. But she was very possessed.

60
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,778
And then they started asking her.

61
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:39,317
And then they came and asked me, “Mother, what she is saying – is it true?”

62
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,382
I said, “You should find out yourself."

63
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:48,580
Because  those days people were such that if you tell them anything like that,

64
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:51,175
 they would turn their faces.

65
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:57,455
Only the kind of false gurus who would say “Alright, you give me five rupees."

66
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,389
They would be very happy that, “You can purchase the guru!

67
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,098
Now you don’t have to bother about anything.

68
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:07,800
You don’t have to do anything."

69
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:16,168
So, with that, gradually, it started working out.

70
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:21,168
And I remember that these people who got their Realisation

71
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:26,261
 asked me, “Mother you allow us to do Durga puja."

72
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:31,724
Durga puja was regarded as something, a very difficult thing.

73
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:38,862
And Brahmins were normally not ready to do it,
because they were not Realised-souls,

74
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:46,747
so they used to get into fits and into all kinds of problems.

75
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,054
So they called the Brahmins, seven of them,

76
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:53,126
 and told them, “You just don’t worry.

77
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:58,194
Nothing will happen to you, because now you are facing the Reality.

78
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:01,939
It’s not some sort of a...

79
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,827
murti  puja or anything. It’s a human being."

80
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,526
They were quite frightened. They came down.

81
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:13,680
But something happened to them: with a great

82
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:17,852
confidence they started all the mantras, everything,

83
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,988
and the vibrations started flowing everywhere.

84
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:29,052
Even, we were very close to the sea, I found  the sea was roaring.

85
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:33,860
But people didn’t understand.

86
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,531
Except for these seven people, they said, “Nothing happened to us,

87
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,829
we dideverything so well!”

88
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,728
I think that was the first miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

89
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,957
You see, the trouble with human mind at this level,

90
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:55,794
 or at this time, is that they have too much of self-importance,

91
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,038
 and they think no end of themselves.

92
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,194
So already they think, “We are great!

93
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:07,598
What is there to know ourselves?
We know ourselves very well."

94
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:16,192
So the basic seeking power is humility.

95
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:24,289
If you think you know everything, you cannot humble down, and you cannot seek.

96
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:30,218
Even if you seek, they don’t want to follow anybody’s path.

97
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,776
They say, “We have our own path.

98
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,808
We will follow our own path.

99
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,438
We’ll do whatever we want to do!”

100
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:42,621
And, like this, I faced many people, in different countries,

101
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:46,926
who just came to listen to my lecture, that’s all,

102
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,323
but they wouldn’t take Realisation.

103
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:57,612
And some of them did take their Realisation, they got it, but they got it lost.

104
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:05,207
Somehow this was such a funny story for me

105
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:08,548
that: I am giving them Realisation,

106
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:11,185
 I am taking no money for it, nothing.

107
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,971
I used to travel on my own.

108
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:18,875
But despite that, why is it, that the people

109
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:22,970
don’t realise the value of Self-realisation?

110
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:29,988
Then a gentle man who got Realisation, in the first lot,

111
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:37,693
he told me, “Today, is a consumer society, as they call it, whatever it is."

112
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:43,379
That, “Unless and until you take money from them, they will never value it.

113
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:48,441
Let them feel that we have paid for it, for our Realisation.

114
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,240
So at the gate only, you should keep somebody to take money,

115
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:54,054
 otherwise they don’t take to it."

116
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:58,135
I said, “But you cannot sell it – it’s falsehood.

117
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,530
You cannot sell Self-realisation to people."

118
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:07,122
He said, “Then, you see, you won’t be successful."

119
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:13,597
With other gurus this is main thing is that they just accept

120
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:17,045
the money and even they tell people, “Bring so much money!

121
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,839
Do this much. There is a fees.

122
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:27,462
And that’s how only the ego is satisfied and people take to false people.

123
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:34,265
This falsehood, they may realise later on,

124
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:40,243
because they suffer a lot, with all kinds of physical,  mental problems,

125
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:44,601
 but by that time they are gone cases.

126
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:52,479
Now the Sahastrara has not been yet described in any one of the books.

127
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:57,357
Though they have talked about it, in our ancient books, in India also.

128
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,855
They have talked about Sahastrara

129
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,754
but nobody has described it except that it has one thousand petals.

130
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:10,961
At least if they had mentioned something about it,

131
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:15,798
it would have been easier for me to show that, “See, this is written in the book."

132
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,239
Because people are like that!

133
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:23,822
It has to be written in some book and that only they accept.

134
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,943
It’s a very difficult situation!

135
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:30,946
Because nobody had given a collective Realisation,

136
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:34,690
so nobody had written to that extent, except for

137
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,476
one or two people who wrote clearly about Kundalini.

138
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,936
But I wouldn’t say it was so clear, because it was all in poetry.

139
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:48,807
So people would sing the songs, but they would not understand.

140
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:55,570
But I was thinking, “How these people who were lost,

141
00:22:56,018 --> 00:23:02,288
here and there under some sort of a seeking, what will happen to them?

142
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:08,799
And how will I be able to give them Self-realisation?”

143
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:19,719
Experiences were so horrid, but doesn’t matter.

144
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:26,835
I went on and on and on, and I worked it out.

145
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:35,200
Of course, we met some people who were also very cruel and nasty,

146
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:40,528
 who troubled me and troubled Sahaja Yogis.

147
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:52,403
All these things should have really dampened my enthusiasm.

148
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,826
But on the contrary I started thinking, “Why?
Why people are like this?”

149
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:09,458
Then I realised one thing: that we cannot have the whole world to get Self-realisation.

150
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:14,280
This is the Last Judgment.

151
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:21,677
At this time people have to decide what is the most important thing.

152
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:30,002
They have to know themselves and understand what they have got.

153
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:42,888
It’s not just having a big number that will help us, but really solid Sahaja Yogis.

154
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:53,179
Then I found there were people who got cured of many diseases

155
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:57,197
but most of them got lost.

156
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,052
Some of them, who were drug addicts, gave up drug-addiction.

157
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,494
Drinking, they gave up.
Smoking they gave up.

158
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,140
I never said a word, that, “You give up this or give up that."

159
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:15,732
I knew, once the Kundalini rises, they will automatically give up.

160
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:18,142
And it happened.

161
00:25:18,254 --> 00:25:26,089
And that’s how people became so clean, so beautiful, and started enjoying their life.

162
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:29,116
But nobody would believe them.

163
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:35,597
When they went round and talked to people, they said, “Oh, you have gone mad!”

164
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:40,768
They couldn’t believe how they have stopped drinking, how they are not smoking.

165
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,080
They said, “We want to drink! And what is this?”

166
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:52,560
So, the identification, I found, of these people were mostly

167
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:58,632
with the very loose type of enjoyment.

168
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:06,399
They enjoyed very loose type of things, which had nothing to do with the Spirit.

169
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,989
Gradually, of course, it started working out.

170
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:23,187
But still, I must say, that we can’t expect, in this Kali Yuga,

171
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:30,193
to have billions and billions of people in Sahaja Yoga.

172
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:37,161
Though it’s my desire, it’s your desire, and you want them to get their Self-realisation,

173
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,770
by which so many good things can happen.

174
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:47,966
Firstly, your physical self improves.

175
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,256
Many people have been cured.

176
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,300
Christ cured only twenty one people.

177
00:26:56,267 --> 00:27:03,349
But I don’t know how many thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:13,252
Also there’s another very big problem with human beings:

179
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:22,635
 that they read all kinds of books,

180
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:28,389
and they have no clear-cut idea as to what they should find,

181
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:31,685
what is their seeking.

182
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,065
It’s a very big problem.

183
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:39,746
And whatever is in one book, they’ll try to follow that.

184
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,364
I mean they are  shifting type of people.

185
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:47,163
They shift from one to another

186
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:55,169
 and then progress in Sahaja Yoga is much more difficult, very difficult,

187
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:58,253
 because if you are going on one path

188
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:03,734
and you start shifting from one to another, you may go back.

189
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:07,613
But in that they find it is their ‘freedom’.

190
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:13,126
Actually without Realisation you don’t have your freedom, of anything.

191
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:23,290
Freedom is that in which you know what you are,
you know what you are capable of.

192
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:28,977
In the freedom you are the one who should receive all the blessings.

193
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:33,566
If these blessings are not there then you are not free.

194
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:42,052
There’s something wrong, somewhere, in your own life.

195
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:48,795
Because once you get your Realisation you become absolutely free people.

196
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:55,502
‘Free’ means, your own Spirit guides you.

197
00:28:55,872 --> 00:29:04,155
The Spirit, as you know, is the reflection of the Divine, the God Almighty.

198
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:10,155
If everybody has the same reflection and He’s awakened,

199
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:17,542
 then in the awareness it works.
As if they know what is right and what is wrong,

200
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:21,524
 what is constructive and what is destructive.

201
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,142
It is not some sort of a false satisfaction that you have,

202
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,255
but in reality, you feel the Reality.

203
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,020
And that is what it has to happen.

204
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:40,546
The first thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get the experience,

205
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:47,383
experience of feeling the spanda, the cool breeze, on your finger tips.

206
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:51,265
Without the experience you should not believe anything.

207
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:59,093
That means a new dimension has come now, in your nerves,

208
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:08,110
that you can feel the system

209
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:14,061
which has been not known to you.

210
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:22,627
Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working.

211
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:27,285
The knowledge about yourself was so poor.

212
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:32,886
But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened.

213
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:38,710
Suddenly you started feeling it, the newness, among yourselves.

214
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:42,652
Still sometimes you haveto fight your ego,

215
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,500
you have to get over your ignorance of things.

216
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:50,770
Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge,

217
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:55,367
Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged.

218
00:30:56,978 --> 00:31:02,265
It’s single: as they call it – ‘Ekameva Satya’, (the only Truth).

219
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:09,963
And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also.

220
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:14,754
You can find out if it is correct or not.

221
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:20,621
This is something that has happened to all of you,

222
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:27,624
 and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it.

223
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:35,991
For example, there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:44,628
But you can find out, on vibrations, who are these people and what are they doing.

225
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:52,991
On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached
that state of Reality or not.

226
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:59,132
You can make out if these people, who are

227
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:05,951
trying to oppose you, or trying to tell you something else –
 “How far are they?”

228
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:09,741
On your fingertips you know.

229
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:15,820
This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.

230
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:20,972
The other day I must tell you, an experience we had: There was one fellow

231
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:27,619
  who came from the television  known as ‘Star’.

232
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:34,644
And he started asking me very funny questions, which had no relevance.

233
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,474
His name was ‘Abbas’, so I said, “Abbas bhaiya,

234
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,340
you are wasting your time and my time.
Will you come to the right questions!”

235
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:48,745
So he said, “I am against all fundamentalism."

236
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,719
“But I am not fundamentalist.

237
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:55,101
How do you know I am that or not?”

238
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,092
So he said, “I am trying to find out!”

239
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,579
“Alright,” I said, “you put your hands towards me.

240
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:07,800
Mohammed Saheb has said that ‘At the time of, Qiyamah your hands will speak’."

241
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:13,039
And, you will be amazed, immediately he started feeling cool breeze on his hands.

242
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:16,651
He said, “What’s happening to me?”
I said, “That’s what it is!”

243
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,121
 No use arguing, no use talking about it,

244
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,089
no use enquiring.

245
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:30,639
Just see yourself the experience of it.

246
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:39,155
He just got so stunned and after that whatever he talked to me, he never published it.

247
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:44,820
So what I am saying  that if the people reach the Truth

248
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:50,319
and they know this is the Truth, nothing can change them.

249
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:53,226
If they have reached the Truth, I am saying.

250
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:59,399
You can see in the life of all the great people that they think “This is the Truth”.

251
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:08,012
Not by just reading, not by just believing but as an experience,

252
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:13,303
 that, on their central nervous system they can feel the Truth.

253
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,864
Then it is impossible to change them.

254
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:26,054
Like you can see a seed becomes a tree, then you cannot make the tree into a seed.

255
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:31,902
Seed is a seed, but when the seed changes into the tree

256
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,193
then you cannot bring it back to the seed.

257
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,401
It may create more seeds, that’s different.

258
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:43,162
so, in the same way, once you have got your Realisation,

259
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:46,408
and once you have become one with the Divine,

260
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:51,621
 then there is no question of you going down, unless and until you,

261
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,764
yourself, want to go down.

262
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,666
It’s very very remarkable, how you get this property,

263
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:05,526
how you get this ability and this capability,

264
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:09,171
 and after that you don’t lose it!

265
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:15,017
Of course, first you must grow, and for that you have to meditate.

266
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:21,553
But this meditation, once you do it, the whole

267
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:28,718
being itself gets so enlightened and so beautiful that you don’t want to change it.

268
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:32,524
You want to be there and enjoy it forever.

269
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,782
But of course you want to give it to others

270
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,776
because you see  you are enjoying so much.

271
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:41,781
Like, on the street, you find somebody

272
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,131
starving and you are very full, then you feel like giving food to that person.

273
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,462
In the same way, you see in this world, people are madly seeking, running up and down,

274
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:54,552
doing all kinds of things, so you want to tell them.

275
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,832
They may or may not believe.

276
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:06,978
They may try to absolutely deny you, defy you.

277
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,972
They can do anything.

278
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:14,511
But you know for definite that you are on the right path, you are on the

279
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:20,564
right state of mind which is a Sahaja state.

280
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:26,039
In Sanskrit it is called ‘sahaja avastha’, ‘sahajavastha’.

281
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:31,749
In sahajavastha you do not react, you do not react.

282
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,724
You just see and appreciate.

283
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:38,778
Now see: I came, I saw this beautiful, such an idea of Sahastrara,

284
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:44,487
all the chakras, they have crossed over, gone up there and from there they have.

285
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:46,891
Very good expression.

286
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:54,987
But any other person would say, “Oh, this colour combination is not good!”

287
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,709
“Why did they use this?

288
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:00,982
Why don’t they use something else?”

289
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:04,923
Like that, you see, finding faults with others!

290
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:13,335
And this finding faults actually comes from your brain which is not yet enlightened.

291
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:17,189
You cannot enjoy anything because you react.

292
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:19,198
All the time you go on reacting.

293
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:23,242
If somebody says something nice, still you are reacting.

294
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:27,778
If someone says something bad, of course you are reacting!

295
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,583
No question!

296
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:39,082
So for us to understand that
we are not free to react, we are not that cheap to react.

297
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,758
We are on a very high pedestal.

298
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:48,180
What is our job Is to enjoy?

299
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:50,770
Enjoy everything.

300
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:58,263
And that enjoyment is the blessing of the Divine.

301
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:04,818
Even you can enjoy the turmoil and the torture.

302
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:09,238
Everything you can enjoy if you see the point that:

303
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:14,426
nothing can happen to your Spirit, which is the real light.

304
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:21,821
Whatever you may suffer, whatever you may think is troubling you –

305
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,466
actually this silent light of the Spirit

306
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:35,651
makes you absolutely, perfectly joyous and you give joy to others.

307
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:39,634
You don’t design it, you don’t plan it,

308
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:43,568
how to give joy, but you just automatically give joy.

309
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:52,782
And this giving joy is also effortless, sahaj, because you are in the sahaja state.

310
00:38:53,112 --> 00:39:01,692
In the sahaja state you just see things.

311
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:05,130
It’s a drama, you feel.

312
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:11,508
It’s a different styles, different types and you just see and watch,

313
00:39:11,963 --> 00:39:16,341
 and get the joy out of it.

314
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:22,233
It is not important to say, “I like this, I like that." No!

315
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:28,172
That ‘I’, which likes, is nothing but ego,

316
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:36,836
and keeps you out of the enjoyment which is reality, which is real.

317
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:44,157
Every thing in this world, that you find is troublesome,

318
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,470
 if you see  from another angle, from a sahajasthiti,
you won’t feel the troubles.

319
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:56,827
But that higher life should be there.

320
00:39:57,032 --> 00:40:01,567
That higher standard should be built-in within you.

321
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:07,059
The other day I had a meeting with the bureaucrats

322
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,591
and I told them, “I know that the pay is less.

323
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:16,804
You may think that the others get much more pay, they are having much more facilities.

324
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:21,727
But there is one way you can really enjoy your work:

325
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:25,655
if you have patriotism, deshabhakti."

326
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:32,759
If you have patriotism for your country, no amount of sacrifice

327
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:37,053
 will satisfy you. You’ll want to give everything.

328
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:44,217
And you can go through all kinds of so-called dearth and depressive states

329
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:47,453
without even feeling anything about it.

330
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:53,536
And, at the same time, your feelings become very deep.

331
00:40:54,409 --> 00:41:02,360
For example, you are travelling and suddenly you find somebody who is sick:

332
00:41:02,612 --> 00:41:07,344
you can feel it on your vibrations that this person is sick;

333
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:12,856
and immediately your sympathy and your love flows to that person.

334
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:14,658
You will try to help that person.

335
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:18,555
If possible you will try to even cure that person.

336
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:23,824
Just like that, your whole being becomes like an ocean

337
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:28,326
which absorbs all the rivers and

338
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:36,532
all kinds of watery things, whatever it is, within its abdomen, I should say.

339
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:43,369
It just takes all that is there,

340
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,665
but it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t trouble him.

341
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:53,590
He is like over-powering person, with his love.

342
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,864
He doesn’t show his power.

343
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:59,073
He does not bother about his self-importance.

344
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:04,433
If somebody tries to insult you, “Alright."

345
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:08,131
What is there there, the insult part of it?

346
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,296
And such people who have reached that sahajavastha

347
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:17,066
 are the greatest creators of art, of music,

348
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:22,859
of great thoughts and that’s why these survive.

349
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:27,689
So many people write, but it goes out.

350
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:31,735
So many people create, but nobody bothers.

351
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:37,113
But those who are Realised-souls, whatever they create, is of eternal nature.

352
00:42:37,406 --> 00:42:42,031
Because they are now in the Ocean of Eternity.

353
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:47,224
They are in the ocean of purity,

354
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:54,801
where there is no idea at all, of hurting anyone or troubling anyone.

355
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:58,415
Such a protection is there for them.

356
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:01,705
They cannot be harmed!

357
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:06,234
Because after all you have entered into the kingdom of God,

358
00:43:06,552 --> 00:43:10,660
so who can dare harm you or trouble you?

359
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:20,969
Such a prosperity I have seen among Sahaja Yogis,
and such a generosity that they have,

360
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:24,761
and such understanding about things.

361
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:29,849
I don’t have to give lectures, “Now don’t do this and don’t do that!”

362
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:31,624
No, no more.

363
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:44,138
And those who are not yet already matured in Sahaja Yoga should try to mature.

364
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:50,446
And those who are not matured and troubling, don’t worry about them.

365
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:52,671
You should have pity.

366
00:43:52,782 --> 00:43:57,636
You should really have pity for such people that they are so immature.

367
00:43:58,255 --> 00:44:03,340
Today it is something great, I feel, because thirty years I have been

368
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:10,180
running up and down everywhere and I have been able to gather so many people.

369
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:16,408
There are so many Sahaja Yogis, you see, and also, all over the world.

370
00:44:16,805 --> 00:44:19,199
This is just a wee-bit of that.

371
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:25,760
So this is something  was to happen, has been already described,

372
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:31,101
has been prophesised by people that such and such thing will be happen,

373
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:35,619
 that so many people will get their Self-realisation.

374
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:40,786
Unbelievable it was, of course, but, as now you see,

375
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:46,556
 how sweet is the feeling that we are all one.

376
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:53,884
There’s no quarrel, no fight, no bad ideas, and nobody likes cheap things.

377
00:44:54,489 --> 00:45:03,615
They want to have something that is pleasing and has a quality of understanding.

378
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:10,015
And I have seen people becoming poets, writing beautiful poetry.

379
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:13,224
I have seen people becoming orators.

380
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:20,486
Also I have seen people becoming very good organisers.

381
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:27,119
But one thing is very important, is the humility.

382
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,024
I said in the beginning and again I would say: what will appeal to people is your humility.

383
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:40,572
You should be a humble person, not think that you are something special,

384
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:53,327
or not think that you are some sort of a self-important person.

385
00:45:53,966 --> 00:46:00,336
Once you think that you are important then you are not part and parcel of the whole.

386
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:06,526
If my one hand starts thinking, “I am important,” it’s stupid.

387
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,855
How can one hand be important?

388
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:11,095
All hands are needed.

389
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:13,057
Everything is needed.

390
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:14,615
Legs are needed.

391
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:17,512
How can one part be so important?

392
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:23,798
If you start thinking like that anywhere in your journey of Sahaja Yoga,

393
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:27,003
then I must say, you are not in the sahajavastha.

394
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:36,231
So my own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja,

395
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:41,916
 where you will be absolutely one with your Self,

396
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:46,379
 one with the nature, one with all the people

397
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,652
who are around you, with your own country, and countries.

398
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:57,500
Everywhere, the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmanda (universe)

399
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:03,059
becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.

400
00:47:03,249 --> 00:47:13,750
Then the echoes – they call ‘ninaad’

401
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:20,223
 the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen.

402
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:26,715
Not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing

403
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:32,410
but in the spiritual area, which is the highest.

404
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:38,783
Everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality

405
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,531
and, till today, they are all remembered.

406
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:51,056
In the same way you all will be representing a very great knowledge

407
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:58,305
about Reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working.

408
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:03,495
In every way you can do anything.

409
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:08,102
Now, only thing that, now, we have to do is to decide:

410
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:11,343
how many people we are going to give Realisation?

411
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,570
What we can do for Realisation?

412
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,777
What should we do?

413
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:21,965
This is the only thing, if you go on with your

414
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:34,547
complete emancipation, you will be surprised, it’s like climbing up a big mountain.

415
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:39,502
But when you have reached to the peak, you can see everything very well,

416
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:42,981
and you feel so satisfied that you are at the peak.

417
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:48,750
So, that climbing part, even  some of you have to do it,

418
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:52,720
 it is alright, there’s no problem, you can do it.

419
00:48:52,828 --> 00:48:56,455
You must have respect for yourself, love yourself,

420
00:48:56,521 --> 00:49:01,480
and  understanding that you have to reach the peak, peak of the mountain.

421
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:05,465
And once you have reached the peak of the mountain you will know you are there.

422
00:49:05,748 --> 00:49:09,868
And then you start showering all your love,

423
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:14,484
 affection, and everything, that flows down the mountain.

424
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:16,568
That is the life for you.

425
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:19,446
It’s the greatest type of life.

426
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:25,914
Forget all other people: politicians and all other people who were supposed to be great.

427
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,226
Forget them!

428
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,730
You are much higher than that,

429
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:40,007
 because you are already chiselled like a diamond with the Sahaj style of life;

430
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:48,638
which is very satisfying and also which is very much absolutely peace giving.

431
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:52,334
It gives you joy, it gives you peace,

432
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:57,609
it gives you capabilities, it gives you so many things that you cannot count,

433
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:02,623
 like the thousand petals of your Sahastrara which are enlightened.

434
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:06,651
God knows what all you can have with this!

435
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:12,990
This is such a tremendous area you are in – the thousand petals.

436
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:17,679
And from there, people have gained all the knowledge about science,

437
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:21,855
knowledge about all the great discoveries are from there.

438
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:27,601
So this is what one has to realise one’s own esteem.

439
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:33,725
Self-esteem is different form self-importance.

440
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,200
You should have self-esteem.

441
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:38,729
With that you will become humble.

442
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:44,944
You will become very loving because you are capable of love.

443
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:47,986
And it is not forced on you.

444
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,749
I agree that from the ocean the clouds rise

445
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:57,101
and then they give rain and all that,

446
00:50:57,203 --> 00:51:01,218
but it is in the cycle of life  they are doing it.

447
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:04,967
They are not conscious of it.

448
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:10,170
They don’t think that they are doing something great because they are in the cycle.

449
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:13,994
You are out of the cycle and still you are doing

450
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,126
work without any feeling of self-importance.

451
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,629
You are doing because you have to do it!

452
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:30,342
Another cycle, not the natural cycle, but another cycle of awareness,

453
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:33,432
 where you are aware as to what you are doing.

454
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:39,836
At the same time you are very humble, you are very loving, you are very kind.

455
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:43,917
You don’t shout, you don’t beat anyone.

456
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,280
You don’t say anything harsh to anyone.

457
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,815
And you can manage the most difficult person.

458
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:56,077
If someone tries to be funny, you can always raise the Kundalini

459
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:58,464
and be satisfied with it.

460
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:03,977
If you secretly raise the Kundalini, the other person is finished!

461
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,119
If you cannot raise it, then forget it!

462
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:10,910
Forget it! He is a difficult person, you know, it’s a stone.

463
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,318
Now in the stone, what can you do?

464
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:23,588
You cannot make it flow, the love and the dignity, all these qualities.

465
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:29,237
It is not possible from a stone-hearted person, so forget it, that’s not your job.

466
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:31,455
That’s not your job at all.

467
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:38,389
So, I would request that, first of all, you should see that: how much humble we are.

468
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:45,892
You have to be very humble and that is your decoration, that is your beauty.

469
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:53,588
So you have your love, which is pure, without any lust or greed.

470
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:59,902
You love others only because you are in love.

471
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:05,691
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

472
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:09,921
 you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

473
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,864
And you will be amazed – with peace, wisdom will come to you.

474
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:18,687
You will be regarded as the wisest man, wisest woman,

475
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:21,492
because you are at peace with yourself.

476
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:26,332
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

477
00:53:26,475 --> 00:53:30,769
you can discover every solution that you want to.

478
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:39,492
You become  very wise and sensible person – outstandingly great than others.

479
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:42,846
You are not like common, general, people.

480
00:53:43,383 --> 00:53:47,050
Then you have joy.

481
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:53,024
Joy is something I cannot express in words but still

482
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:57,366
joy, as I have told you many a times, it is singular.

483
00:53:57,532 --> 00:54:01,645
It is not happiness or unhappiness, it is just joy.

484
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:03,633
Just you enjoy.

485
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:10,910
You enjoy everything, enjoy every company, every incident,

486
00:54:11,021 --> 00:54:15,382
every scene, every happening in your life.

487
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:17,963
You know how to enjoy everything.

488
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:22,119
You see, just joy has a great capacity.

489
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,040
Once, I remember I had gone with my son-in-law and daughter

490
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:31,333
to see some historical place and we had to climb a lot.

491
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:36,706
We were climbing for about three hours, so, naturally, we all got tired

492
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:41,419
 and there was a little resting place, made of marble,

493
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,245
so we said, “Let us spread out ourselves here!”

494
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,950
So when I spread it out, they were so much

495
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:54,350
saying, “Why should we have come here, of all the things"
All that they were grudging.

496
00:54:54,508 --> 00:55:01,904
Then suddenly, you know – this is the joy point –
suddenly I saw the carvings of elephants.

497
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:04,886
So I said, “Can you see these elephants?

498
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,986
Everybody’s tail is differently made!”

499
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:15,079
They said, “Mummy, how could you see the elephants’ tails?

500
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:17,511
We are so tired!”

501
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,172
 I said, “You also see! Just see that."

502
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:27,372
Because this joy, it shifts, shifts your mind from nonsense.

503
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:30,272
You just say, “It’s all nonsense."

504
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,130
You just shift your mind.

505
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:33,989
This is the way you get joy!

506
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,785
And goes to the thing that will  joy giving.

507
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:40,792
Supposing there is a person who is quite boring,

508
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:45,095
you know, then what happens, you just see the

509
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:50,738
 humour behind boring: how a person bores you!

510
00:55:52,870 --> 00:56:02,290
And what you learn out of it is – never bore anyone.

511
00:56:04,488 --> 00:56:14,665
So this joy has a speciality, that it teaches you the essence of joy of everything.

512
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:23,325
If it is a bad film, still you enjoy because you see how bad it is.

513
00:56:23,892 --> 00:56:28,627
Supposing, of course if it is a good film, then you can always see them!

514
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:35,116
But you do not go with a mind, how to criticise.

515
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:38,933
This criticism business goes out of your mind.

516
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:43,144
So what happens  your mind shifts immediately

517
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:48,716
from something that is ridiculous to something interesting in the same thing.

518
00:56:49,048 --> 00:56:54,027
So you don’t criticise and you don’t feel bad about it.

519
00:56:54,411 --> 00:57:02,591
Sometimes it so happens that people are amazed that how I tolerate such people.

520
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:08,040
But I don’t tolerate, I am not paying any attention, whatever the person may be doing.

521
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:15,272
If you are of that nature, that we can call as a condition

522
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:21,470
where you are absolutely in the Turya state:

523
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:25,185
 so Kabira has said, “Jab mast hue, fir kya bole?”

524
00:57:25,312 --> 00:57:30,230
When I have gone into that state of joy, why should I say anything?

525
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:37,967
It is like that: a temperament which you have to understand, and respect it.

526
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:40,336
That is within you, but respect it.

527
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:44,857
Do not compare it with others, others are not at your level.

528
00:57:44,966 --> 00:57:49,195
So you are at a different level and you just try to enjoy.

529
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,787
Never feel that you are something higher or greater – no, never feel .

530
00:57:53,968 --> 00:58:01,288
What you should feel  that thankfulness that you are not mixed up with

531
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:07,303
 all those funny ideas and funny style of life

532
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:10,218
where you go on criticising – “This is not good!
I don’t like it!

533
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:11,730
I don’t like it!”

534
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:15,747
 Who are you?You don’t know yourself.

535
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:18,998
When you say, “I don’t like it,” you are not knowing yourself.

536
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:22,595
How do you know what you don’t like?

537
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:28,375
I have seen people with very poor knowledge,

538
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:35,610
who are just knowing  little bit here and there, are very critical of others.

539
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:38,470
I don’t know the reason, why it is so.

540
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:41,733
But maybe that they think no end of themselves!

541
00:58:42,544 --> 00:58:45,033
But this is what is very common.

542
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:51,191
But if you know the Absolute Knowledge, then you become really humble;

543
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,648
absolutely humble and sweet, gentle and kind.

544
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:03,846
So today is a great day otherwise, for me also: I didn’t know

545
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:08,382
 that I will survive so many years to see this beautiful day.

546
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:15,349
Because after all, it was very hard life, according to others’ standards.

547
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:23,432
But what is most joy giving to me was creating Sahaja Yogis,

548
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:28,040
 and listening to them and talking to them,

549
00:59:28,326 --> 00:59:34,551
the way they were so sweet and so kind and so respectful!

550
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:39,834
All this has helped me so much and I must thank you for that.

551
00:59:40,064 --> 00:59:47,103
With your support, with your help, with your understanding, I could achieve it.

552
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:54,501
If I could have achieve it on my own, I would never have asked for this help of yours.

553
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:59,383
But you are just like my hands, you are just like my eyes.

554
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:03,394
And I need you very much because, without you I cannot do it.

555
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:07,090
It’s like channelising: unless and until you have channels,

556
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:10,396
what’s the use of being Adi Shakti or anything?

557
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:12,126
How will you channelise it?

558
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:21,171
If there is electrical movement, you need channels, otherwise its a static thing.

559
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:27,227
In the same way I felt, always, that I needed more and more channels,

560
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:33,058
and when it worked out, I was really, really in a very great Spirit.

561
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:38,785
So I thank you very much, again, for this day that has come.

562
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:44,187
And I bless you from my heart that – now you take over responsibility.

563
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:49,029
You are a Sahaja Yogi, so you have a responsibility, also,

564
01:00:49,108 --> 01:00:52,538
 to give Realisation to others. Don’t keep to yourself.

565
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:54,906
This has to be given to others.

566
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:58,261
And you can explain, you can talk to them,

567
01:00:58,373 --> 01:01:01,063
you can really, very well, understand them.

568
01:01:01,263 --> 01:01:05,883
Try to understand them and talk to them.

569
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,725
And you must give Realisation to others, otherwise you won’t feel complete.

570
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:14,702
To feel complete, you have to do that.

571
01:01:14,948 --> 01:01:16,824
May God bless you all.
