1
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,800
It’s such a great thing to meet your children 
after such a long time.

2
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:43,050
And 
this country was really pestered with cold

3
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,890
so I had to come here I think, just to make 
you feel warmer with love.

4
00:10:47,890 --> 00:11:02,210
It’s a very heartening thing to see so many 
people who are in England, who are Sahaj Yogis.

5
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:16,850
As you know England has to do tremendous effort 
to keep Sahaja Yoga afloat; not only that,

6
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:23,040
but you have to set in examples for others.

7
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,320
As England is the heart of the universe it 
circulates.

8
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,840
Whatever example you set in, circulates.

9
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,290
People try to follow you.

10
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,490
As I have told you before also, that English 
people should not try to follow other people

11
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,600
but establish their own proper character.

12
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:54,640
But not to be insular by which you don’t 
appreciate anybody else or you cannot understand

13
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,620
international relationships.

14
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:13,010
We are one world and it’s only one great 
Viraat in Whose being we circulate.

15
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:22,340
Moreover for the people who are from the heart, 
[they] have to be much more open and moving

16
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,340
and giving because that’s the job of the 
cell of blood that passes through [the] heart;

17
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:51,190
and that’s how you are made specially for 
this.

18
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:59,120
I have been speaking after you finished your 
tour on a subject in India.

19
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,640
But I think it is more related to us here 
in the West than to Indians.

20
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:14,790
And that is something we have to understand: 
that we are in the midst of terrible conditions,

21
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:23,150
horrible conditions which are taking us to 
hell.

22
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:41,220
And we realise how important it is for us 
to get together and save this area which we

23
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,680
called as ‘the Western world’.

24
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,600
So I have already given a little talk which 
you may hear when you have this seminar or

25
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,560
this Shiv puja.

26
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:06,700
But I would like to tell you about it: that 
Shri Krishna, a long time back, told that

27
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,310
the roots of the awareness are in the brain, 
but the human awareness grows downward.

28
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:20,960
That’s how we have grown downward.

29
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:35,010
We have grown towards things which, if allowed 
to grow that way, may take us away completely

30
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,230
from the roots.

31
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:46,530
Now if you start the movement, as I said, 
from Bhavasagara, from the evolutionary process,

32
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,560
of going downward.

33
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:59,880
Now in the Bhavasagara that is in the viscera 
of the stomach and all these places, we have

34
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,160
a capacity, what we call as of consumption.

35
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,850
We can even consume the poison.

36
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,490
The liver can consume the poison; it has the 
capacity to consume the poison as heat and

37
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:26,290
then it delivers the heat to the water of 
the bloodstream.

38
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:35,620
So the capacity we have to consume all those 
things makes us, what we call ‘swahaa’:

39
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,910
‘swahaa’ means ‘consumption’.

40
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:46,450
And from this consumption, when we consume 
all these things: we consume our ego, we consume

41
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:52,080
our conditioning, we consume all those things 
which are detrimental to our growth [then]

42
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,090
we become ‘swadhaa’.

43
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,730
‘Swa‘ is the Spirit and ‘dha’ is the 
dharma.

44
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,060
We get the dharma of the Spirit.

45
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,370
And you know what is the dharma of the Spirit 
is – is Sahaj, Sahaja.

46
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:18,050
But when we start going downward only with 
our awareness, from the Nabhi Chakra we start

47
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:25,590
moving downward, what happens to us [is] that 
we move to the second position of Swadhishthana

48
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:31,850
and the Swadhishthana has got the essence, 
I mean, has got the capacity to be ‘bhurvah’.

49
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,440
‘Bhurvah’ means the whole Creation, the 
universe that is created.

50
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,550
That’s how we get creativity through Swadhishthana.

51
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,940
So when we start moving downward, what happens 
to us [is] we go to all the stars and the

52
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,040
planets and all that are created, that’s 
what we are doing, wasting our energy for

53
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,520
nothing at all.

54
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,330
But apart from that in the wrong way when 
we move, our attention goes to creativity

55
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:12,990
which is destructive, which is negative, which 
brings death, which suggests insipidness.

56
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,260
Like the art today is, when you see the art, 
you don’t know whether to vomit, to run

57
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,550
away or to cry.

58
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,550
So that explains why people are producing 
such horrid things and when you look at them

59
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,280
you don’t understand what is this going 
on.

60
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:40,710
So the art, the creativity, in every way, 
the creativity of every kind becomes so horrid.

61
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,270
So the third stage is that we go to ‘bhuh‘.

62
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,380
‘Bhuh’ is this Mother Earth.

63
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,900
Mother Earth is the one which also creates 
Shri Ganesh.

64
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,980
Now when we go towards Mother Earth we start 
extracting Mother Earth, taking out all that

65
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,780
is precious, that is needed out of proportion 
– because we have got machines.

66
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,090
Now we have got machines so we must produce.

67
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:11,400
The machine must produce more and more and 
more, out of proportion it should go on.

68
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,950
And when it wants to continue it has to go 
on that way so that you feed the machine to

69
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,090
produce more.

70
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,700
Now this production is useless!

71
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,060
There is no need to have so much production 
for us.

72
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,390
You see plastics after plastics, then there’s 
nylons after nylons, then there’s all kinds

73
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,810
of polyester and I don’t know all kinds 
of things that they have started producing.

74
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,300
All man-made nonsense that they have.

75
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,120
There’s no need to have so much.

76
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,370
Then we go on accumulating things and that’s 
how we become extremely materialistic people.

77
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,900
Actually to be materialistic in the real sense 
is that we understand the value of matter.

78
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,360
And the value of the matter is aesthetics.

79
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,380
Artistic things, real artistic things.

80
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:10,490
And beyond that the value of matter is that 
you can give love to others through that matter:

81
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,350
by giving as presents, by your generosity.

82
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,880
So you lose that also!

83
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,420
That power also you lose.

84
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:25,140
That is, you start extracting your Mother 
Earth in such a way that you don’t know

85
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,600
what to do with the acid gas that is coming 
out of these productions and then all your

86
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,310
trees are getting destroyed.

87
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,590
It’s so destructive.

88
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,760
The whole thing is so destructive.

89
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:45,670
So then you move to the essence of Mooladhara 
which is innocence.

90
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,730
And when it is innocence, you start attacking 
innocence.

91
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,810
Now you read horrible things, when you come 
here.

92
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,170
I got the jitters when I heard about the six 
year old girl and a three year old girl: I

93
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,170
just can’t bear it.

94
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,800
Supposing that was my child what would have 
happened to me?

95
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
And it’s my child.

96
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,960
That’s how I feel.

97
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,680
Then we are attacking the innocence everywhere 
in every place and we have no sense of Mooladhar.

98
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,590
That’s how we go down.

99
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,990
And one step forward where do we go?

100
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,370
Into hell.

101
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,370
That is our movement.

102
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,390
We are going towards hell!

103
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,570
Straight forward, our movement is towards 
hell!

104
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,430
Because I have explained in that little talk, 
you can hear it again, that, when you see

105
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:38,110
the steps, you see the downward steps, then 
you just see the platforms which are very

106
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,750
good, maybe of marble, very attractive, very 
sensational, whatever you may call it.

107
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,270
And you feel like going down, it’s easy 
to go down with the gravity because you have

108
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:56,120
come out from amoeba state or even earlier 
from carbon stage, so you feel it’s easy

109
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,430
to go down.

110
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:03,820
It’s much easier to go down, so you go on 
stepping on these steps and go down.

111
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,610
You don’t see the heights.

112
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,920
But when you are going higher, rising higher 
then you start seeing the heights.

113
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,020
And when you see the heights what do you see 
from down below?

114
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,350
Absolutely this is our task.

115
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,740
From the hell we have to pull out people up.

116
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
That’s hell!

117
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,520
And this is what we call as the ‘adhogati’ 
– going downward.

118
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,240
‘Adhogati’ – going downward.

119
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,540
We have to take to ‘Urdhvagati’ ( ऊर्ध्वगति)- 
going higher.

120
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,990
How do we go higher?

121
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,860
Only Kundalini is the way.

122
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,730
That you can see clearly.

123
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,830
Even people who try to go higher without the 
Kundalini, say from Nabhi upwards, how do

124
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,830
they do it?

125
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:50,470
They go up to mana, this is the emotional 
side, that’s the motherhood.

126
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,750
And you go against the mother.

127
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,980
When you go there what you find [is] that 
you get attached to this woman, that woman,

128
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,020
then that thing.

129
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,420
It goes on to this family, to other things 
and again you come down.

130
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,520
Then you go ahead, you go into ‘janah’ 
– is the one which is what we call ‘the

131
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,830
public’, ‘the others’.

132
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,480
‘Janah’ is ‘the public’, is the Viraata’s 
place.

133
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,390
As you know this is the Viraata’s place.

134
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:23,190
And when you go to that place, to Viraata’s 
place, what happens to you [is] that you start

135
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,110
becoming very conscious of yourself, “Oh, 
I am a public man.

136
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,370
I am a public person.

137
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,580
This is my reputation.

138
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,730
I am this and I am that."

139
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,750
And then you start exploiting people with 
your politics and all other things like that.

140
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:43,440
And you develop your egos; all kinds of nonsensical 
things.

141
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,110
With your mana, from your centre heart, you 
develop also your conditionings and that’s

142
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:56,500
how you develop a funny personality which 
is not urdhvagati, which is not going higher,

143
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:03,790
but is actually giving you additional problems 
on your back!

144
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:10,160
Then the third thing is here at the Agnya, 
as I told you, you develop your ego.

145
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,540
The other day Patrick rang me up to say, “Mother, 
why are we developing our Agnyas so much nowadays?”

146
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,500
I said, “Stop reading newspapers!”

147
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,910
The prime ministers are fighting for their 
seats and this and that and if you read newspapers

148
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,520
you will also feel that you are a prime minister 
[and] you better fight it.

149
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,050
Because when you see a picture or any drama 
sometimes you get identified and you think,

150
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,980
“I am Napoleon myself!”

151
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,920
So don’t read newspapers!

152
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,710
Don’t read about these mad people who are 
just trying to overpower each other.

153
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,000
Like this [Ferdinand] Marcos fellow.

154
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,460
The other day somebody said that, “Mother, 
you get rid of this Marcos!”

155
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Now he’s out!

156
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,990
So many will be out but what about us?

157
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,610
Do we have some of them within our heads?

158
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,040
Do we also have the same ideas of materialism 
or ego or all these trips that these people

159
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,890
have had?

160
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,700
So as a result, when you see these things, 
on the contrary, you should try to avoid it

161
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,650
and jump on to urdhvagati.

162
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,110
Then you go higher, from there, in the head 
is the Sat, is the Truth.

163
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,660
That’s what you discover, Truth; should 
discover in the normal way.

164
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:33,790
But in the abnormal conditions when you try 
just to climb up to the brain, what happens

165
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:40,180
is that whatever you know through your mental 
conception becomes the truth.

166
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Everyone is like that.

167
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,060
You see, about religion you will find a person 
believes that, “This is the truth.

168
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,550
Now this is the truth!”

169
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:53,610
“I am the one who represents Christianity”, 
“I am the one who represents Mohammad Sahib”,

170
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:59,690
“I am the one who represents Nanak Sahib”, 
“I am the one who represents Shri Rama,

171
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,190
Shri Krishna."

172
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,380
None of them represent.

173
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,350
It’s just a concept.

174
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,680
And with that concept if you move about like 
that then what happens [is] you just get stuck

175
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,290
on to that idea.

176
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,390
That is how fanaticism comes in as far as 
religion is concerned.

177
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,910
There are many, many things like that, “This 
is a concept and that’s the fact, and that’s

178
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,180
the truth and that’s what I believe in this!”

179
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,390
But why do you believe in that?

180
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,560
Who are you?

181
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,950
When they say, “I believe,” just go and 
ask them, “Who are you after all to believe

182
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,950
in that?”

183
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,950
That’s Mr.

184
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,450
Ego, that’s all.

185
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,370
Then there are people who are conditioned.

186
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,390
And that’s what, whatever is their conditioning, 
they think, “This is the conditioning.

187
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,830
This is the thing I am brought up.

188
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,670
This is how I have lived and this is how I 
am, and this is what is the truth."

189
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:52,400
Both things are absurd, mythical.

190
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,180
That’s not the Truth.

191
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,850
So when you start through your urdhvagati, 
through your Kundalini you see the height.

192
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,890
You see that, “Now we have to rise!

193
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,890
We have to rise.

194
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,890
Rise with our innocence.

195
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,250
We have to get to our innocence."

196
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,030
We have to be innocent people.

197
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,610
But even in Sahaja Yoga you will find some 
people, I call them sometimes like monkeys,

198
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,830
jump from urdhvagati to adhogati, adhogati 
to urdhvagati.

199
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:25,230
You don’t know which side they are going!

200
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,940
You have to hold on to these steps which you 
have got.

201
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,480
First is the innocence.

202
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,450
Your morality, as you call that, or a chastity.

203
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,960
That’s the first step you have to achieve.

204
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,660
Unless and until you achieve that step how 
are you going to go further?

205
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,740
But it’s the other way round.

206
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,240
They think if you tell something very truthfully 
to Mother, “I have had five love affairs,

207
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,270
I have had six abortions, ten this thing, 
then Mother is going to be very happy with

208
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,160
me,” because they have told the truth.

209
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,900
That’s not the truth.

210
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,580
That’s not what is wanted.

211
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,280
Are you now a chaste person?

212
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,890
Have you got the ideas of chastity and dharma?

213
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,450
That is the second step you can move into.

214
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:23,210
Aesthetically, are you rich aesthetically, 
are you generous?

215
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,690
Can you appreciate the art of every country?

216
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,160
Or you just say, “Oh it’s not good because 
it’s not English!”?

217
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,620
Or “It’s not good because it’s not French!”?

218
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,440
Or maybe, “It’s not from Wimbledon!”

219
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,340
Could come to that point!

220
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,830
I mean, what is happening to us?

221
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:49,290
We are becoming so insular, so small, so narrow 
in our outlook, that’s impossible.

222
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,470
We cannot appreciate another person at all.

223
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,200
You ask anyone, everybody has an opinion about 
others, what about yourself?

224
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,540
What is your opinion about yourself?

225
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,950
Can you laugh at yourself?

226
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,240
And when I am giving lecture we also sometimes 
think that Mother is talking about somebody

227
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,450
xyz, not about me.

228
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,270
That’s not so.

229
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,100
We have to project to ourselves and find out: 
are we in chastity?

230
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,630
Are we in dharma?

231
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,630
Have we achieved that?

232
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,510
Have we achieved our innocence?

233
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:29,190
Have our eyes achieved that innocence, that 
simplicity, that power?

234
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:38,210
So then we move up higher on the bhurvah state 
where we have to know: are we aesthetically

235
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,780
equipped?

236
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,900
Do we have proper aesthetics?

237
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,770
In our behaviour, in our dress, in our lifestyle, 
in everything?

238
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,390
Or are we still going on with the same things?

239
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,420
Like some hippies when they come to Sahaja 
Yoga, it’s impossible to make them understand

240
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,250
that – no more hippies now!

241
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,140
Then some come from another group, another 
funny style, then they have the same style

242
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,350
of behaviour.

243
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,350
No!

244
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:19,000
‘Sahaja’: we have to be in the Sahaja 
style, which is a common style for all the

245
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,880
Sahaja Yogis all over the world to dress up 
decently, to talk decently, to have sweet

246
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,420
words, no harsh words, no anger, no temper, 
nothing of the kind.

247
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:36,150
But very, very gentle and a dignified personality.

248
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:42,900
Now here some of the so-called dignified also 
can be very bhootish, I have seen that.

249
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,100
They can be very dignified and they can be 
very inauspicious.

250
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,490
So another quality of innocence, which is 
auspiciousness; or we can say the combination

251
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,150
of innocence and bhurvah state is auspiciousness.

252
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,990
Does your house give auspiciousness?

253
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,850
Does your countenance give auspiciousness?

254
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,950
Is your talk auspicious?

255
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:10,120
Is it a mantra when you talk?

256
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,460
Have you purified yourself so much that everything 
that you do, every movement that you have,

257
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,050
is auspicious?

258
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,420
Is it blissful to be in your house?

259
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
To be in your company?

260
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
To be with you?

261
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Is it blissful?

262
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,780
Let us direct ourselves to ourselves and see 
that: are we blissful?

263
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:39,250
Are we emitting vibrations that are good?

264
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,790
It’s a very tremendous task because you 
have to do it!

265
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,790
You have to do it!

266
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,790
Nobody else is going to do it!

267
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,230
If you want to save this world, you must know 
it’s a tremendous task and one has to go

268
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:58,950
into a tapah for that, to know that you have 
to be pure people.

269
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,090
Otherwise there could be hypocrites.

270
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,950
There are many who are Sahaja Yogis and not 
at all Sahaja Yogis.

271
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,910
Sahaja Yoga is not for hypocrites at all.

272
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,730
You cannot be a hypocrite.

273
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,860
You have to be what you preach, what you say, 
what you understand and what we stand for.

274
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:19,300
It’s not like this, “Oh I am a Christian, 
all right, I am a Christian, but it’s all

275
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,820
right, I can have adulterous eyes, all right 
because after all, you see it’s all allowed."

276
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,020
“Then what else?”

277
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,040
“Oh, I can drink, smoke."

278
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
“What else?”

279
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,790
“Oh, I can also kill some people, it doesn’t 
matter you see.

280
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,190
It’s all right I’m Christian after all."

281
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,320
How are you a Christian?

282
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:49,980
Then, “I am a Hindu, you see I am a perfect 
Hindu, but doesn’t matter if I try to discriminate

283
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,720
between Sikhs and Hindus, doesn’t matter."

284
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
How, why?

285
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,280
There’s no discrimination allowed in Hinduism.

286
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,300
No discrimination of any kind.

287
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,580
Everybody has the same Atma.

288
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,720
How can you discriminate?

289
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,320
How can you have dowry system in a Hindu society?

290
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,020
How can you have any caste system in a Hindu 
society?

291
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,690
You cannot have, just cannot have.

292
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,610
It’s not the religion.

293
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:24,020
So they speak one thing, do another thing, 
it’s all hypocrites and all fanatics.

294
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,440
And that’s how they become fanatics!

295
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,980
Like you ask Bishop of Canterbury, he says 
that, “Holy Ghost, I don’t know, I am

296
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,100
agnostic about it!

297
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,770
I am doing my job!”

298
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,860
That’s all!

299
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,390
This kind of frivolous attitude or we can 
say a very hypocritical attitude is not for

300
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,390
the Sahaja Yogis.

301
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,610
They have to be what they are preaching, what 
they are standing for.

302
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:53,230
They cannot have that kind of a personality 
that one can say, “Oh, I have seen this

303
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,820
hypocritical fellow, calls himself Sahaja 
Yogi!”

304
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,000
We can’t!

305
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,660
There has to be somebody who is genuine, who 
is real, who is truthful.

306
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,620
We cannot live with that kind of a compromise.

307
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,300
We have to be what we are because we have 
got the light of the Spirit.

308
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:23,690
So then you go ahead and you have to become 
the higher personality of a guru through consumption.

309
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,190
Consume, how much I consume!

310
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,020
Go on consuming all the time.

311
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,990
This time I came, I am consuming your Left 
Vishuddhis, I am consuming your viruses.

312
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:39,970
I don’t know, in two days I must have consumed 
oceans and oceans of troubles.

313
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,610
No, we don’t consume at all!

314
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,190
Because if somebody says something to us we 
must come back with a harsh word, somehow

315
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:54,530
or other to kill that person that is finished 
forever – that’s smartness.

316
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,700
We can consume all that.

317
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,370
That consumption is taught by Christ very 
well.

318
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,960
Can we consume?

319
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
No!

320
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,400
We come out with big, big talks and big, big 
things, you see, “We must do this, we must

321
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
do that!”

322
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,140
We are not here union leaders, are we?

323
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,020
We don’t want to appear in the newspapers 
or anything.

324
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,130
What we want [is] to consume, we are here 
to consume things.

325
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,860
Newspapers are to advertise, expand it.

326
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,170
We are here to consume all that is bad.

327
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,160
Do you follow your responsibility please?

328
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Consume [all] that is wrong.

329
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,850
How do we consume?

330
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,350
Through meditation, through prayers.

331
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,000
Now this is happening in this country.

332
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,040
What are we doing about it?

333
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:55,480
So we have to consume it, not to get into 
explosions, not to get into expressions, but

334
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,940
to consume it.

335
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,600
Then you become swadhaa.

336
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:14,470
‘Swadhaa’ is that you become the dharma 
of the Spirit – ‘swa’, ‘dha’.

337
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,160
You sustain that dharma within yourself.

338
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,710
Then you become that.

339
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,350
It’s not any kind of hypocrisy about it.

340
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,460
I mean, if I say, “Don’t drink."

341
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
You shouldn’t drink wine.

342
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,800
I don’t drink at all I mean, no question!

343
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,720
I mean, you cannot make me drink even if you 
want to.

344
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,520
If I say, “Don’t tell lies!” then you 
don’t tell lies.

345
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,110
You don’t just do it because you have to 
just say that way, or you say that, “Don’t

346
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,110
kill!”

347
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,990
I cannot kill anyone.

348
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,170
I cannot be tempted.

349
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,960
In the same way you all have to feel, “I 
cannot do it, I cannot be tempted.

350
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,410
How can I be tempted?”

351
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,200
Say, “I shouldn’t get into tempers.

352
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,590
I shouldn’t be angry for nothing at all."

353
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,390
For the slightest thing, people just jump 
into a temper.

354
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,220
That means, “I should not be tempted to 
do that."

355
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,300
That wisdom, that dignity, that balance, that 
poise must come into a Sahaja Yogi.

356
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,080
Unless and until that comes into you who is 
going to believe you that you have achieved

357
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,200
anything of this transformation?

358
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,540
You are still on adhogati, sometimes into 
urdhvagati.

359
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,120
Then going into adhogati, again to urdhvagati.

360
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,580
You are jumping from one to another.

361
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:40,260
So now you move on to another higher level, 
is from there to [where], what you call, the

362
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,020
‘Mahalakshmi tattwa’ starts; where you 
start jumping on to a much higher position

363
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,470
where it is mana.

364
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,290
‘Mana’ is emotions.

365
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,010
Your emotions become compassion.

366
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,380
Now see the difference between emotions and 
compassion: is very different.

367
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:05,570
When the tree hasn’t got flowers it takes, 
when it gets the flower, it gives, it gives

368
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,570
the fragrance.

369
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,050
In the same way, when you become the compassion, 
you give.

370
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:17,740
You don’t expect how others treat you, how 
others behave towards you, but you think [that]

371
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,840
by giving you will win over the person.

372
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,530
You give.

373
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:31,270
And that is what you have got: to give compassion 
through your vibrations.

374
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,600
But to have that you have to be swadhaa.

375
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,940
Unless and until you have that you cannot 
give vibrations either.

376
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,330
So then all these smaller ideas, “It’s 
my wife, my husband, my child, my house, my

377
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,440
this, my brother, my sister."

378
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,230
In the beginning everybody comes up with the 
whole family list.

379
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,270
They may not have seen their father for ten 
years but they’ll come, “My father is

380
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,760
sick, Mother cure him first.

381
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,640
I have not seen him for ten years."

382
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Doesn’t matter!

383
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,530
So every person becomes a liability on Mother 
that all the relations, all the great grand

384
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:13,990
parents and all the great grand children must 
be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:22,270
But there is no compassion!

386
00:38:22,270 --> 00:39:03,280
And in compassion you do not see these relations.

387
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:20,700
So, when you become the compassion, before 
this you are to be enlightened.

388
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,720
You are to be enlightened, you have no light, 
you don’t know how to walk the path, you

389
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,320
don’t know how to go round, you don’t 
know how to know others, you don’t know

390
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
where you are sitting.

391
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,850
If in a group, you put off the lights everybody 
starts hitting each other or trampling over

392
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,160
each other because they don’t know.

393
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,620
But now the lights are on.

394
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,600
So you know how you are related to each other.

395
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,140
You are under the light.

396
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,360
You can see each other.

397
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,870
You can feel each other.

398
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,450
You can understand each other.

399
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,610
That’s how the compassion works.

400
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,250
Compassion works automatically – you don’t 
have to do much about it.

401
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,050
But know that you have to be a compassion.

402
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:09,760
But if you are still are a person wanting 
others to love you then it won’t work out.

403
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:18,000
How much did you love them?

404
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,650
Is your love for another person doubted?

405
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,470
Do you doubt?

406
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,110
Then you are not compassion.

407
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,220
In that love you may even scold the person, 
you may even shout at the person.

408
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:37,530
But the love should be there for the benevolence.

409
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,210
So the compassion should be for the benevolence 
of the person.

410
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,350
If you are not benevolent you have not been 
compassionate.

411
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:49,090
Like spoiling somebody, spoiling your child, 
spoiling your wife, spoiling your husband.

412
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,990
This is not compassion!

413
00:40:50,990 --> 00:41:01,900
Compassion is a pure ray of beautiful light 
of God’s love which gives benevolence to

414
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,090
another person, hita.

415
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,130
So that should happen to you when you talk 
of compassion.

416
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,840
You go further with the janah – public.

417
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,520
Those people who cannot carry on with Sahaja 
Yogis are absolutely useless people.

418
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,500
These are the cream, these are the best people 
in the whole world.

419
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,200
Of course some are like this, doesn’t matter.

420
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,090
But they are the topmost people, they are 
the people wedded to such high ideals.

421
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,010
Where do you get anybody with idealism?

422
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:41,470
You go to the UN, you go anywhere you find 
people, they have no idealism of any kind.

423
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:47,860
It’s only for the job, only for the money, 
or this or that, [that] they are working there.

424
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,040
You are the people who have idealism.

425
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,120
You are the people who are striving for something 
higher.

426
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,790
You are the people who are going to save the 
whole world.

427
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,370
And those who cannot carry on with Sahaja 
Yogis and find faults with Sahaja Yogis are

428
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,120
really no good for us.

429
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,240
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

430
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,910
What is your public?

431
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,590
First and foremost is Sahaja Yogis.

432
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,550
The rest of them are outsiders so far.

433
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,350
But your attitude should be that you have 
to pull them out.

434
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,590
You have to emancipate.

435
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,590
You have to be kind to them.

436
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,360
You have to be compassionate.

437
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,870
And you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

438
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,220
You have to be extremely nice to them.

439
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:38,170
But more than that you have to be very, very, 
extremely nice to Sahaja Yogis.

440
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,300
I can’t understand Sahaja Yogis being nice 
to others and not to their own clan or you

441
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:55,360
can call whatever you may call it – to their 
own brothers and sisters.

442
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,870
When I see Sahaja Yogis together loving each 
other, being kind to each other and also giving

443
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,460
some good news about each other I feel extremely 
happy.

444
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:11,940
That’s one of the most joyous times for 
me.

445
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:53,770
When I find that you are giving.

446
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:04,270
So then you come to the point where you are 
in the public, you are in the public.

447
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,820
You have to circulate now.

448
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,910
You have to articulate in the public.

449
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,730
You have to move in the public.

450
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:15,500
You are not only for a secluded group of Sahaja 
Yogis, you are not that.

451
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,650
But you have to articulate, you have to circulate.

452
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:26,090
Now for that, what should we do?

453
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:37,800
You have to understand that we have to form 
other groups, other things by which we can

454
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
circulate.

455
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,320
Let’s see now in England we can form some 
societies.

456
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:49,730
Let’s form some society which are not what 
we call them as the Sahaja Yogas.

457
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,780
Because you are different from them.

458
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,760
So now let us form some societies.

459
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,590
We form certain societies, say let us form 
a society where we talk about the decadence

460
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:09,090
of this country; how the decadence has come 
in, why it is there, why are we spoiling our

461
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,910
young children, why are we behaving like this.

462
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,970
Let us see.

463
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,490
Let us start a society under this name.

464
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:23,610
Let us start a society which will fight all 
social problems.

465
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,760
Like I said in India: let us start a society 
which is against dowry system.

466
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,390
That’s how you will circulate with them.

467
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,860
And later on when they come up to a point 
they will see your character and then you

468
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,520
can talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

469
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,800
Like these women have, what is that called?

470
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,020
‘Women’s lib’ and all that.

471
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,270
I mean, it is nonsense, you know that very 
well.

472
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,190
But they have formed the society, so they 
are there, they are circulating.

473
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,450
We have to have sensible, wise people forming 
a society.

474
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:04,740
So from Sahaja Yoga group we have to move 
to society: where you need not talk about

475
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,420
Sahaja Yoga, you need not tell them there 
is emancipation.

476
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:14,270
But let us circulate through them and let 
them know about dharma.

477
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,840
Forming no religion as such.

478
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,150
It’s inner religion as we have.

479
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,350
Just without any religion you can start it 
off.

480
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,000
So that’s how you meet the public.

481
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,660
There are many such ways, which you can think, 
by which you can meet the public.

482
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,380
And then you have to know you are the part 
and parcel of your Mother.

483
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:44,060
There are three things asked from God: that 
there is salokya, that, “Oh God, We should

484
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,720
be able to see you,” salokya.

485
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,510
Samipya is, “Oh God, let us have your company."

486
00:46:51,510 --> 00:47:05,830
And third one is, “Oh God let us have a 
rapport with you."

487
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,860
Rapport with you.

488
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,020
These are the three things are asked from 
God.

489
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,300
But the fourth thing that has happened to 
you is tadatmya, means you have become part

490
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,970
and parcel of my body.

491
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:23,030
As a result of that you have to keep your 
body all right, you have to be pure people,

492
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,790
you have to be sensible, otherwise I get into 
trouble.

493
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:35,380
But it’s a very venturesome thing I have 
done, doesn’t matter, I don’t mind.

494
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,940
But you people look after yourselves.

495
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,050
You be sensible people.

496
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:45,030
And when you have funny ideas in your head, 
know that these funny ideas can trouble our

497
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,250
Mother very much.

498
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:53,770
So out of love for me, you have to keep loving 
yourself.

499
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:59,410
And you can love yourself only if you have 
pure intelligence to know what is frivolous,

500
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:07,070
what is nonsensical, whatever is asahaj.

501
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,870
So you move like one body, always support 
each other.

502
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,730
If one person is troubled the rest of them 
should help.

503
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,930
That’s how the collectivity is going to 
work out.

504
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:25,380
Not to criticise each other, to sit down and 
just to show off.

505
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:34,560
So then you rise even higher to this state 
of Jesus Christ, Mahavira and Buddha.

506
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,200
Then what do you have to do?

507
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,130
Is tapaha, is the penance.

508
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,150
You have to do the penance.

509
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:49,130
Like living in Brahmapuri was a penance, I 
thought, but you all enjoyed it bit too much.

510
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,490
Or Ganapatipule, you thought it was too much.

511
00:48:51,490 --> 00:49:05,740
Some people did do some penance by sitting 
in the sun! (laughing) But penance means ‘sacrifice’.

512
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,500
Sacrifice.

513
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,330
Without feeling the sacrifice, do the work 
as a sacrifice.

514
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,410
You are bound by work.

515
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,570
We have to work.

516
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,260
Human beings have to work.

517
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,660
But the work that is a sacrifice is the most 
nourishing thing, is the most joy-giving thing.

518
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:32,600
And that’s what happened: in Brahmapuri 
I must say it was very spartan, both for you

519
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:38,210
and for your hosts it was quite a funny place 
to live in.

520
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:45,010
And one snake crawled into somebody’s shoes 
I am told, but still you all enjoyed it because

521
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,280
you didn’t feel the sacrifice.

522
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:53,530
It was in a way [a] sacrifice for both the 
parties I think: your hosts and the guests.

523
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,610
But you still enjoyed.

524
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,270
And that’s what it is.

525
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,290
Now you will enjoy your sacrifices.

526
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,110
Apart from all other virtues you will enjoy 
your sacrifices.

527
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:09,960
That is one of the quality of the Spirit, 
because you are so detached.

528
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:17,240
You will enjoy it!

529
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,690
So that’s how you come to the state of tapah.

530
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:25,700
And the last is satya, is the truth.

531
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,450
That is what is in the brain as Shri Krishna 
has described, are the roots where you have

532
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,470
to go.

533
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,770
Of course, the doors are open to you.

534
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,690
You must know that you know the truth!

535
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,940
You know the truth, nobody else.

536
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:50,000
Are you aware of this, that you are the only 
few people under this roof who know the truth?

537
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,220
The rest don’t know any truth whatsoever.

538
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,490
So you have to be compassionate to them because 
they are blind, they can’t see.

539
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:00,820
As we are kind to the blind people we have 
to be kind to the people who do not know the

540
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,820
truth.

541
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,820
You know the truth!

542
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:08,130
And the truth is that you are the Spirit.

543
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:14,200
And then you know, through all miracles, that 
you are walking in the Kingdom of Heaven.

544
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,760
That you are blessed by God and that you are 
looked after by Him.

545
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,730
So many miracles happen, so many of these, 
that suggest that you are really looked after

546
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,800
by God Almighty.

547
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,180
So many beautiful things have happened to 
you.

548
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,330
Just think of them one by one from where to 
where we have come.

549
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:39,010
From down below hell rising up one by one, 
step by step, now we have come to the brain.

550
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:46,450
Thanks to our Kundalinis that we have come 
up there, that the Mother has brought you

551
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,450
there.

552
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,670
This Kundalini which is your Mother has brought 
you there.

553
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,100
Respect Her and respect your Realisation.

554
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:01,090
Respect each other and know that you are higher 
than billions and billions of people of this

555
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,090
earth.

556
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:10,040
You are special people and as that you have 
to behave in the most humble, respectable

557
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,860
and a loving manner.

558
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,080
I say love is the highest.

559
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:25,060
Everyone who has developed a language of love 
is working out God’s wish because God’s

560
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:34,760
wish, His desire, His iccha, that Shakti, 
is the power of love.

561
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,730
We work out everything with hatred: what’s 
wrong with that person, what’s wrong with

562
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,740
that house, what’s wrong with this association, 
with that.

563
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,880
That is all hatred.

564
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,560
But let’s see what’s good with that, what’s 
nice, what’s joyful.

565
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:55,080
When your eyes turn that way, when your attitudes 
turn like that, then you must know that you

566
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,110
are Sahaj Yogis.

567
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:09,360
For that Christ has given us a big weapon 
called forgive, forgive, forgive.

568
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,610
And the truth has dawned upon you.

569
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,030
You know the truth.

570
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,470
Through your vibrations you know, through 
your vibratory awareness you know.

571
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:21,260
But, there is a very big ‘but’ for which 
I have to tell you again and again and I am

572
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,840
telling you again today which is the most 
important thing for a Sahaj Yogi – is to

573
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,110
use your vibratory awareness.

574
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,920
They don’t!

575
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,930
They just don’t use their vibratory awareness.

576
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,850
In judging others they never use their vibratory 
awareness.

577
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,010
Then how do we say they are special people?

578
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,780
Because you have the same eyes, you have nose.

579
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,850
What about your vibratory awareness?

580
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,840
Did you see the vibrations when you did something?

581
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,240
You did not!

582
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,090
That’s why the mistakes.

583
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:55,750
Because these vibrations come as an indication 
from something that is your Spirit, which

584
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:00,940
is an absolute thing, which is in absolute 
state – it is not relative.

585
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,940
It’s absolute.

586
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,510
So whatever information it gives you is absolute.

587
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,820
And you should take to that absolute understanding.

588
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,130
This is where we miss.

589
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:18,510
So today just before Shiva Puja, Shiva Puja 
is the puja of the Spirit within you.

590
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:23,850
It’s the Spirit within you.

591
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:30,800
And for this puja specially you have to determine 
that now we will use our vibratory awareness

592
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,070
to judge something.

593
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,410
“I think…” is not there.

594
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:41,670
“I think…” is a wrong idea.

595
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,920
I know through vibratory awareness.

596
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:50,220
We have to develop a word for this, which 
we say, “I feel…” it could be something

597
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,590
nonsensical.

598
00:54:52,590 --> 00:55:03,540
But you really, as they say in Marathi there’s 
a word, ‘zanee’: is a feeling.

599
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,130
But it’s a new awareness.

600
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,760
Through this awareness, this Divine awareness, 
through that, you have to judge everything,

601
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,650
to know everything, and to do everything through 
that.

602
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:19,200
This is what we have to use.

603
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:27,260
And when we start doing that then you will 
know that God is working out everything for

604
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,260
us.

605
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,510
It’s so simple.

606
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,730
Life becomes much simpler.

607
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:38,010
All your complications, all your angers, all 
your troubles, all will vanish as soon as

608
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:44,590
you start using this, because it is such an 
universal thing and such a benevolent blessing.

609
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:49,280
It just makes you wonderful.

610
00:55:49,280 --> 00:56:00,100
You become a wonderful personality: happy 
joyous, straight-forward, open-hearted, fearless.

611
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,600
Absolutely enchanting.

612
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,910
May God bless you all.

613
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:13,250
You want to have any questions?

614
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:27,380
This lecture has been rather complicated I 
think, in a way, so it’s better to repeat

615
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,940
it or them, sometimes, again.

616
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:35,280
Maybe at Shiv puja would be a good idea.

617
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,830
Any question please?

618
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:45,400
New Lady: How can you forgive a person like 
Hitler?

619
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,060
Shri Mataji: Actually, you see, you don’t 
do anything.

620
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,580
When you forgive or not forgive, you really 
don’t do anything.

621
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,580
It’s a myth.

622
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,580
It’s just a myth.

623
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,580
“I don’t forgive."

624
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,580
Means what do you do?

625
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,580
It’s a myth.

626
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:09,950
New Lady: It’s how you feel towards a person 
who has committed so many crimes and the detention

627
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,330
of Jews.

628
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:15,430
Shri Mataji: But what about Jewish now?

629
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,180
If they had forgiven Hitler, God would have 
looked after him!

630
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,310
God is looking after him.

631
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:24,550
But when the Jews didn’t forgive him, they 
have become more like Hitler, sometimes.

632
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,410
They behave like Hitler sometimes I feel.

633
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,780
The way they are treating PLO people is something 
horrible.

634
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,770
You see, so if you do not forgive you become 
like the person you are hating.

635
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,810
If you forgive you don’t become like that.

636
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,840
Just that person goes out of your mind completely.

637
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,510
I mean, they have imbibed certain qualities 
now.

638
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,490
I can’t imagine Jews behaving like this!

639
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:49,400
They are behaving in a very funny manner.

640
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,920
You can see it clearly!

641
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,810
I mean, they had no place to go, they had 
no land to live, they were given a land.

642
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,560
And now the way they are troubling PLOs, I 
was amazed.

643
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,710
Because I met some of the students of this 
PLO people who came to India, who have been

644
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:07,960
given asylum.

645
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,480
And when I heard how Jews tortured them – just 
like Hitler, just like Hitler.

646
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,340
I wish they had forgiven.

647
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,430
I mean, if they had not forgiven Hitler, what 
did they do out of it?

648
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,430
Nothing!

649
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,010
Hitler is punished by God, not by you.

650
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,530
What can you punish him?

651
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,980
You cannot punish him.

652
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,850
Alright?

653
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,530
When we forgive, we don’t imbibe that cruelty 
within ourselves.

654
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,470
That’s the biggest thing that happens.

655
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:44,700
Apart from that we do not suffer when we forgive.

656
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:54,540
I mean, if you go on thinking about it, what 
people did say, imagine, think of the people

657
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,540
when Mr.

658
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,310
Columbus reached America, who followed them 
[and] what they did there!

659
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,390
Horrible things.

660
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,060
I mean, worse than Hitler.

661
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:07,490
They wiped out each and every person from 
there.

662
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:12,500
Then when they tried to consume other countries, 
going to other countries and ruling them.

663
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,230
If you go to China you will be shocked, even 
about English, what they have to say.

664
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,280
Even in India, if you go, you will find.

665
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:23,460
How can anybody forgive them if you think 
what they have done?

666
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,500
But that is finished now and gone, forever!

667
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,840
You are not to think about it at all.

668
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,890
It’s finished.

669
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,020
Today, what is the situation, we have to see.

670
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:42,680
You will be amazed, if I tell you, that myself, 
I was tortured by English very much.

671
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
So what?

672
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,210
For me you are my children.

673
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,760
I don’t think of that at all because that’s 
finished.

674
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,070
They were bhootish people, that’s all – finished.

675
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,070
Where are they?

676
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,380
Where is Hitler today?

677
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,710
Where are those people who died?

678
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,710
Finished!

679
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:00,800
Better to forgive so that God punishes them 
well.

680
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:07,040
Now, today, is not the time of punishing anyone, 
it’s the time of evolving, of helping people

681
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,440
to rise above that.

682
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,590
So there is no more danger of getting any 
Hitlers on this Earth.

683
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,530
We have to create such a beautiful garden!

684
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,360
Why to think of the thorns?

685
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,990
Forget about all that nonsense, you see!

686
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:27,600
These are special blossom times: let us think 
of the flowers and not of the past and the

687
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,670
thorns that we had finished off.

688
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,710
We have to give something very beautiful to 
our children.

689
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:35,770
Isn’t it?

690
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,820
A heritage where people will say, “Oh, I 
see.

691
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:46,540
There were people who forgave all such things 
and created a beautiful world for us!”

692
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:52,990
Isn’t it a nice thought?

693
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:56,340
Better than not forgiving.

694
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:02,390
Like that we go on thinking about, “He did 
this and he did that."

695
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,910
There’s no end to it!

696
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,170
God looks after!

697
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,170
He’ll punish.

698
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,840
He’s punished him so badly.

699
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,850
Now nobody wants to take Hitler’s name!

700
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:15,310
I mean, if somebody sees Hitler’s photograph 
somewhere he will go and have a bath in India.

701
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,270
He’ll just go to the river Ganges and have 
a bath, “Oh God!

702
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:25,310
How did I see Hitler’s face anywhere?”

703
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:33,020
What more you want as a punishment for Hitler 
that they can ’t even face his photograph?

704
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,810
And some person who looks like Hitler, they’ll 
say, “You just shave off your moustache

705
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,640
at least!

706
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,280
Don’t look like that.

707
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,010
It’s very inauspicious!”

708
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:50,860
Yes, I know somebody who looked like Hitler 
and they said, “You shave off your moustache

709
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,090
and comb your hair from the other side, or 
make it a parting in the centre.

710
01:01:55,090 --> 01:02:01,840
We can’t see you like this early in the 
morning!”

711
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
Imagine!

712
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:08,590
What an inauspicious face! (laughter) He’s 
hated by anyone.

713
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,450
You go to any place.

714
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,040
Even in Germany they hate him.

715
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:19,940
So what’s the use of such a character being 
so much dominant on our heads?

716
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,040
Have nothing to do with it.

717
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,300
Because once you start thinking about him 
you also develop certain habits that he had.

718
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,980
A little cruelty comes up when you become 
angry and when you cannot forgive others,

719
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,760
you also think it’s right that you can punish 
others.

720
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,270
Here we are not fighting the sword with a 
sword but with a shield.

721
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:42,490
We are fighting the sword with a shield.

722
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:50,760
We never fight sword with a sword, we fight 
it with a shield.

723
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:58,170
That’s a wise attitude towards life, I think.

724
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,110
Otherwise you will create more Hitlers.

725
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,260
One Hitler is dead and now ten Hitlers have 
come out – already have come out!

726
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:13,590
They are all to be finished now, once [and] 
for all.

727
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:38,250
You can help by creating a new pattern, a 
new world of beauty.

728
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,260
Any other question please?

729
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,860
That’s a nice question, I know it happens 
to her.

730
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,240
But now you are feeling better inside aren’t 
you?

731
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,050
(laughing) Much more!

732
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,850
That’s how we have to bring peace on this 
Earth.

733
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:59,290
How are we going to bring peace if there’s 
still lurking anger?

734
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,570
Not forgiving means anger!

735
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,550
That’s all.

736
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:10,040
Hmmm.

737
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,020
What else?

738
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,750
Ask some questions at least!

739
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,860
Must ask some questions.

740
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,210
Yes, what’s that doctor?

741
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,250
Dr.

742
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:39,930
Brian Wells: Shri Mataji, sometimes in my 
work I find myself getting very angry with

743
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:47,310
the people I work with is this ever appropriate 
or should one always try and love and forgive

744
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,310
them and be gentle.

745
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,310
Shri Mataji: Yes, better try that! (laughter) 
As far as possible!

746
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,310
But sometimes anger can also help.

747
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,200
But I think, just now, for us, we are developing 
now, it’s better to take to the more gentler

748
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,560
ways and things like that and not to get angry 
– for the time being.

749
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,880
But we’ll have to show anger sometimes.

750
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,660
Let God show the anger.

751
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,450
Let him take the credit.

752
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:10,840
You will be more effective if you are gentle, 
I tell you.

753
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:19,450
By anger you cannot correct people, you cannot 
make them more efficient; but by love.

754
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,580
Those days are gone where anger and hot-temper 
used to impress people.

755
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:28,020
Nowadays these people don’t like such people.

756
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:32,170
Anger or some people are also very silly.

757
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:36,890
They think [that] by being silly they’ll 
impress others: like clowns or something.

758
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:37,930
It’s not so.

759
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:44,790
Now we are different people in this world 
and they just know that this is a silly person,

760
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,460
that’s all.

761
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:52,820
They expect a leader or anybody who has to 
give something to others has to be something

762
01:05:52,820 --> 01:06:02,910
of a higher and a better personality – it’s 
expected.

763
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:13,740
Cheapish things or anything that is publicly 
people may like you to do, it a leader does

764
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:18,690
that they don’t like it, they don’t like 
it.

765
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:25,100
A leader is supposed to be something above, 
above the normal.

766
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:29,670
But the idea of leadership these days is alright: 
everybody is doing the ‘shake’ so the

767
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,770
leader is doing the shake.

768
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:36,850
Then everybody wears a tight jean [so] the 
leader also wears the tight jean and he can’t

769
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,550
sit on his chair!

770
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,390
So that’s not the way.

771
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,700
That’s not the way you can be leaders.

772
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,540
A leader has to make a pattern of his own.

773
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:51,710
And he doesn’t have to solve the problems 
of the people but give them the problem to

774
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,710
be solved.

775
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,280
That’s how leadership works out.

776
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:59,810
So for anybody who wants to get anything done, 
must learn that the pattern should be of such

777
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:09,270
a level that others should not take advantage, 
should not think that they can bring you to

778
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,270
your level.

779
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:15,360
For example, I’ll tell you: in India there’s 
a habit of eating tobacco, dried tobacco.

780
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:21,860
Now, those people who eat tobacco, say there’s 
a high court judge – he’ll call his peon

781
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:30,860
and ask him “Have you go the…”, they 
call it ‘dubbi’ means a small little pouch,

782
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:36,090
so, “Have you got the dubbi?”

783
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:39,050
So, the whole dignity is finished!

784
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:41,360
Whole dignity is finished!

785
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:46,300
That, just an ordinary peon can say, “Do 
you want your dubbi?”

786
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,720
So then it’s done.

787
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,600
What about his great position and dress and 
everything?

788
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:02,140
He makes a big gown and wears [and] on the 
head they wear a kind of a wig.

789
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:14,010
And all that is useless because you are asking 
for a dubbi from a peon!

790
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:22,860
So what impresses people is dignity, balance, 
poise, humility and truthfulness – straightforward

791
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:27,790
truthfulness – even in day to day work.

792
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:34,330
Of course efficiency comes like that.

793
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:39,070
Peacemaking.

794
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,770
You must make peace between two persons, ten 
persons.

795
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:46,410
Try to make peace instead of supporting one 
person or taking sides.

796
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,330
Best is to make peace.

797
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:59,100
But if somebody is doing absolutely wrong, 
then you have to take another attitude.

798
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,720
Any other question?

799
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,130
Yes?

800
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:04,950
Yogini: (unclear)

801
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:11,990
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

802
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:22,830
Yogi: She’s asking you to tell us how we 
settle down in Sahaja Yoga.

803
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,830
For the new people.

804
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,830
Shri Mataji: Settle down in Sahaja Yoga?

805
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,830
You are already settled!

806
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:38,070
Gavin Brown: Some of the new people have come 
quite new to Sahaja Yoga, they haven’t met

807
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,070
you before Mother.

808
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:46,460
Shri Mataji: You see, I was born so settled 
down I don’t know! (laughter) First of all,

809
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:53,260
in Sahaja Yoga, one has to realise that you 
have got vibrations.

810
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,500
Now, put it on that.

811
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,230
I think that’s the best criteria.

812
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:01,290
“Am I getting my vibrations alright?

813
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,560
Are they flowing alright?

814
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,830
If not, what’s wrong with me?”

815
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,580
Direct your attention to yourself to find 
out.

816
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,880
“Is there anything wrong with me that I 
cannot get my vibrations alright?

817
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,880
Alright!

818
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,540
There must be something wrong.

819
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,800
Now what is that wrong?”

820
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,220
Try to correct it.

821
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,070
First of all they must direct their attention 
to themselves then they will start settling

822
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,070
down.

823
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:25,000
But all the time, supposing, I have seen many 
people who come to Sahaja Yoga: out of them

824
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,490
some say, “I saw one Sahaja Yogi who was 
like this!”

825
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,420
They see to others: how they are are, how 
they are, how they are.

826
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:37,520
You should see to yourself because this is 
for your benevolence, for your betterment.

827
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,560
So the first attitude should be, “What have 
I gained?

828
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,800
What have I to gain?

829
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,190
How am I to get better?”

830
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:53,010
Or else there could be some people who think 
that, “I must get better.

831
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,180
My health should be alright.

832
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:59,670
I didn’t get kshema, benevolence, as was 
promised by Sahaja Yogis!”

833
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,140
No, something wrong with you: still the yoga 
is not established.

834
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,770
First establish your yoga.

835
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:10,340
If you have not established your yoga how 
can you get what you want?

836
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,180
So, first of all it’s such a genuine effort.

837
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,240
One has to be absolutely genuinely asking 
for that yoga.

838
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,350
And you cannot force people.

839
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,440
You cannot force it.

840
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Whatever lecture you may give.

841
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,040
You may like my lectures or anything, they 
might sound very good but it doesn’t matter.

842
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,570
It must go into your being.

843
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,660
It must work out in your being.

844
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,110
You have to become something.

845
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,360
You should certify yourself that, “Yes, 
yes.

846
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,080
I am like that."

847
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,090
We may be very few – doesn’t matter.

848
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,090
It’s meant for the few.

849
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:47,610
It cannot be given to every funny type of 
a person or a person who is just forced into

850
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,610
Sahaja Yoga.

851
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:49,610
You cannot force it.

852
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:55,570
It’s not like winning over election, you 
see, that you make somebody a communist and

853
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,290
overnight he becomes a capitalist.

854
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,720
It’s not like that.

855
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,430
It’s the inner growth.

856
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:08,680
And only those who are deserving, who have 
that value of their own existence – only

857
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,380
such people can come.

858
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,130
So you cannot force on them at all!

859
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,590
They have to see to it.

860
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,580
And what they have to see in other people 
[is] that what are they doing that they are

861
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,990
so much settled.

862
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:24,390
And there should be an understanding that 
we have just now entered into the university,

863
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,140
say for example: a new class we are in.

864
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,860
Now how are we to go higher and higher?

865
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,190
Their attitude has to be that way.

866
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:35,070
You cannot force things into them.

867
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:39,490
It’s like I always say [that] I have cooked 
for you, the food is ready.

868
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:41,160
If you are hungry you will eat it.

869
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,890
I cannot force the food into your mouth!

870
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,630
You have to taste it yourself and enjoy.

871
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:51,930
But there’s a gap, gap between when they 
get Realisation and when they feel joy because

872
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:56,430
specially in the West they have no idea as 
to what Realisation is, they have never known

873
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:57,430
the Kundalini.

874
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:02,650
It’s a new language to them, everything 
is new, so they have to be given little assistance

875
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:06,480
and help to tell them that, “No, there is 
joy!

876
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,480
You have to go beyond.

877
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,060
You have to see [that] these things exist.

878
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,640
Whatever the saints have said is true.

879
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,570
Whatever the scriptures have described is 
true and you can find out.

880
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,780
But you have to have patience with yourself."

881
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:21,950
But if they want to criticise and they want 
to say, “Oh, how can that be?

882
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:22,950
And how can that be?”

883
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:25,850
Such people will take too much time!

884
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,250
But there must be some genuine seekers.

885
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:33,920
And there are some slow movers also so accordingly 
they move and you cannot force them.

886
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:40,110
At the most you can support them for a while 
but then again they drop down.

887
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,110
You have seen that.

888
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:46,030
It’s happening every time in the West specially, 
not in India.

889
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,030
Not in India.

890
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,180
Not that, also, in [Indian] villages – it 
doesn’t happen.

891
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:51,710
Once you get six thousand you get six thousand 
– finished!

892
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,090
I have known least of them.

893
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,550
I don’t know who they are [but] they are 
there.

894
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:59,800
You meet them somewhere and they’ll just 
come and fall at my feet and say, “Mother

895
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,350
I am a Sahaja Yogi."

896
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,560
I said, “I know that.

897
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,560
I know you are.

898
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:10,560
You are my children I know just from your 
presence I know you are my children."

899
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,380
So they have to become that.

900
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,400
You cannot force.

901
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,460
That’s one thing we do not realise.

902
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:26,140
You see, now, in the churches they are compromising, 
“Let’s have a disco dance!

903
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:34,280
And in the disco dance when the people will 
come then we will have some Christians there."

904
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,280
Imagine!

905
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,660
People who are going to disco dance how can 
they be Christians?

906
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,890
And this kind of a compromise is there because 
it’s a money-oriented stuff.

907
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,790
It is not God-oriented, it’s money-oriented.

908
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:51,830
So, “We must have more people so that we 
have more money so we can have more clergies,

909
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:52,940
we can give more pay."

910
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,350
It’s all on that level [that] it works.

911
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,180
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

912
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:03,200
In Sahaja Yoga everyone is a temple of God, 
everyone is a church of God and everyone has

913
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,590
to come up to that.

914
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:09,430
And those who do not have that respect of 
oneself, we cannot force.

915
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:11,950
How can you say, “You must have respect 
for yourself!”

916
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,360
Can you say like that?

917
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,800
I mean, it’s something not possible.

918
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,830
That’s what you all people should know.

919
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,760
Also we should reconcile to that.

920
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,170
I have done my level best.

921
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:30,460
Except for standing on my head I have done 
everything that is possible but what I find

922
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,350
is that it’s very difficult.

923
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,350
Too much of ego!

924
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,350
Too much.

925
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:38,090
Too much of ego in the West – absolutely 
– and they are so ignorant.

926
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:41,010
They have never heard the name of Kundalini, 
can you imagine?

927
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,140
What tremendous ignorance there is.

928
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:48,850
But those who are wise, those who have pure 
intelligence, came to Sahaja Yoga, they learnt

929
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,400
everything, they know so much.

930
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,350
And some of the Sahaja Yogis in the West know 
more than Indians know, I know.

931
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:01,890
We can say that there are many good Indian 
Sahaja Yogis but there are some excellent

932
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,060
ones in the West.

933
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:09,990
Par excellence, I should say, some of them 
are.

934
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:13,060
So that’s it.

935
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,060
So why worry?

936
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:21,560
We have the quality, if not the quantity.

937
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,860
But this quality only is going to attract 
these ego people.

938
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,260
That’s only going to attract them, nothing 
else.

939
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,810
This quality of your personality, of your 
temperament, of your behaviour, everything

940
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,210
is going to attract them.

941
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:41,560
But supposing tomorrow you say, “Alright, 
I’ll make a holey jeans,” and walk about

942
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:52,490
with the holes in the jeans and then people 
will say, “What a nice Sahaja Yogi he is!”

943
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:56,000
It’s not the way!

944
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,970
You must have your own personality, you must 
have your own dignity.

945
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:01,130
You shouldn’t behave like them.

946
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:03,230
But you should not condemn them either.

947
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,250
Know that they are ignorant.

948
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,250
They have no idea.

949
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,140
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots 
at all.

950
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:17,730
You have the knowledge, so you have to be 
kind like a teacher is kind to his students.

951
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:21,760
I never expected that in the West I’ll be 
able to talk to so many people myself.

952
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:29,110
I mean, in the beginning when I came here 
they used to say, “This Victorian old woman!”

953
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:30,980
And all kinds of things they branded me with.

954
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,980
So it’s alright.

955
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,980
I didn’t mind that time.

956
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,500
Now they are alright.

957
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,310
That’s how they are, what can you do?

958
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:42,150
To begin with they brand you, they do this 
and do that.

959
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,150
Hmm.

960
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:46,580
Any other question?

961
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:53,400
But the society you can form and get to people 
who believe in a proper life, a healthy life

962
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,480
and healthy society.

963
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,780
You can start a society like that, saying 
that, “We want to belong to the healthy

964
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,780
society."

965
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,460
You can take your children to that kind of 
a thing.

966
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,950
You can get other children: where there are 
no drugs and things like that.

967
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,790
You can start on that level.

968
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:12,820
Maybe from there you might get some people.

969
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:20,210
Anything else?

970
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:38,900
Gavin Brown: Shri Mataji, whenever you speak 
the questions go away!

971
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,350
Shri Mataji: You jump into thoughtless awareness, 
I know that.

972
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:50,710
Gavin Brown: There’s one thing we’d like 
to ask you is to accept your birthday present

973
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:51,710
a little early.

974
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:52,710
Shri Mataji: A birthday present?

975
01:18:52,710 --> 01:19:01,020
I mean if you have so many birthdays I’ll 
become older very fast! (laughter)

976
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,680
Oh, Gavin.

977
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,350
So sweet!

978
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:13,000
Gavin Brown: Something very little.

979
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,610
Shri Mataji: You always say so!

980
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:22,160
Thank you very much.

981
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,930
Thank you.

982
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:36,360
(applause) You better open and show them, 
I don’t know what it is like.

983
01:19:36,360 --> 01:20:09,180
They’ll be very happy to see that.

984
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,460
Those who have got Left Vishuddhi, I would 
suggest you sit down with your left hand towards

985
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,390
me and one hand on the Mother Earth – will 
solve the problem immediately.

986
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:20,970
Just have it.

987
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,360
Left Vishuddhi.

988
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,240
Call your mother here.

989
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:38,850
Let her have a candle.

990
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:46,030
Left hand towards me and right hand [on Mother 
Earth].

991
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:51,480
What’s it Gavin?

992
01:20:51,480 --> 01:21:00,570
It’s quite a big thing.

993
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:07,840
It’s so many pieces.

994
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:14,760
I hope not you have spent so much money.

995
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:27,950
You can say the mantra in your heart, “Mother 
I am not guilty."

996
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:39,290
First [for] your mother, just give her this 
candle.

997
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,360
What’s that?

998
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,430
Oh Gavin!

999
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,030
Beautiful isn’t it?

1000
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:44,030
And a dolphin there!

1001
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,030
Just imagine!

1002
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,350
Thank you very much it’s beautiful.

1003
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,750
It’s beautiful.

1004
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:55,550
It’s very, very beautiful.

1005
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,750
Beautiful.

1006
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:01,550
Thank you very much.

1007
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,750
Haa!

1008
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:07,550
Gavin Brown: It’s French.

1009
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:12,350
Shri Mataji: It’s French?

1010
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:15,390
Why not get something English from English?

1011
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,390
Alright.

1012
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,130
It’s alright.

1013
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:21,780
For me it’s alright.

1014
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,780
Aha.

1015
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:32,080
Working out!

1016
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:41,460
Better?

1017
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,210
Cancer patients should be treated with this, 
those who have got cancer or anything left-sided,

1018
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,410
psychosomatic.

1019
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,440
The other day, doctor – you will be amazed 
– there was a lady who came, she had cancer

1020
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:57,870
of the glands and she had tied up her head 
with a scarf, in Madras.

1021
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:02,160
So while talking I told her, “You take a 
candle and sit there with your left hand towards

1022
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,960
me and right hand outside."

1023
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,280
And after ten minutes I said, “Alright, 
remove your scarf."

1024
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:14,370
The whole thing was cured.

1025
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:17,290
It’s tremendous.

1026
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:25,820
And they have now started that PhD thing in 
India.

1027
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:31,930
Better?

1028
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:44,140
Much better.

1029
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:56,120
It’s working out.

1030
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:01,730
Good.

1031
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:19,390
(Shri Mataji talks to some children)

1032
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:29,150
Akshay, you didn’t give me a kiss!

1033
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:42,210
You must give me a kiss too!

1034
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:49,100
Alright give it to Olympia then!

1035
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,400
Feeling shy!

1036
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,550
So I think I’ll take your leave Gavin.

1037
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:54,650
Is it alright?

1038
01:24:54,650 --> 01:25:28,330
So tomorrow I don’t think you can come early 
in the morning, it’s too early – to the

1039
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:33,220
airport.

1040
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:58,620
And I’ll be leaving about seven o’clock 
from the house, at seven thirty-five I’ll

1041
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,630
be there.

1042
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,040
Are you alright now?

1043
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,040
Good?

1044
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,040
So where’s the baby?

1045
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Where’s Wendy’s baby?

1046
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,530
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s in Southampton 
Mother.

1047
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,120
Shri Mataji: Oh I see.

1048
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,520
So you want to have the name?

1049
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,430
When was she born?

1050
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:28,140
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: She was born on the 
thirteen of February.

1051
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:33,310
Shri Mataji: So call her ‘Himakanya’.

1052
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:42,330
Himakanya is the name of the Goddess born 
when…’Hima’ means ‘the snow’.

1053
01:26:42,330 --> 01:27:01,930
That’s the time she was born, when it was 
snowing.

1054
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:12,790
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s a boy Mother.

1055
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:15,780
Shri Mataji: No.

1056
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,780
Then ‘Himanshu’.

1057
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,770
‘Himanshu’ is alright.

1058
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:23,770
It’s a boy.

1059
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:27,170
I thought it’s a girl they said.

1060
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,430
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: No, no.

1061
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:31,690
It’s a boy Mother.

1062
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:34,520
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ‘Himanshu’.

1063
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,650
It’s good.

1064
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:37,660
‘Himanshu’ is a good name.

1065
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:47,890
‘Himanshu’ means ‘the one who is born 
out of the..’ ‘anshu’ means ‘the essence’

1066
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:50,030
‘Hima’ means ‘the ice’.

1067
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:51,940
He’s the essence of the ice.

1068
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:52,940
‘Himanshu’.

1069
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,650
Is the name of Shiva.

1070
01:27:54,650 --> 01:28:02,400
(Mother meets another young child)

1071
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:10,940
This is a new one?

1072
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:18,730
New Sahaja Yogini?

1073
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:21,330
Aaah.

1074
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:26,530
That’s Leela.

1075
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:31,060
You want some chana?

1076
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:38,230
Leela’s sister: She likes that.

1077
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:52,750
Shri Mataji: Do

1078
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,350
you like that?

1079
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,980
Alright, I’ll give her some chana.

1080
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:10,480
Now only two can fit in here and let’s fit 
the others there.

1081
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,500
Alright.

1082
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:16,610
So you carry some more.

1083
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,210
She has big hands now!

1084
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,520
Come along, have some more.

1085
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,740
You have big, big hands now.

1086
01:29:21,740 --> 01:31:10,220
You’ve become a big girl I must say!
