Buddha place within us do they know who

died is placed within us at a pond and

9
00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:00,809
what does he control within us we have

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,280
to know this knowledge of the roots

11
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,770
unless and until you know the knowledge

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,410
of the roots how will you know about the

13
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,960
treat you cannot treat the treatment on

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,869
its leaves or branches you have to do

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,950
the roots first you find out the roots

16
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:20,050
in Buddhism is so superficial now that

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,810
have myself amazed and Radames living

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:28,479
for God from where death he says buddham

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,869
sharanam gachami what is it this is an

20
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,869
enlightened

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,760
the dumbest work with analyzer some

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,240
gumption cachaca means to the collective

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,690
in tandem is facilitating the monster

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,820
the mummy is the balancing how many

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,580
booties know about they don't know even

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,280
where Buddha is sitting on their head

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,640
and what I find most of the booties but

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,720
their center of Buddha is finished so

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:05,399
thighs disappeared from their husband

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,860
and he set me down here on the head on

31
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,860
the left hand we can prove it on

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,830
Kundalini

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,790
supposing somebody is following Goethe

34
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,980
immediately people will know that you

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,510
are because it's a catchy and then some

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:30,030
methods are there to awaken him

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:37,739
if you all right so you must know the

38
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:42,890
knowledge of routine we should not just

39
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,890
depend on to these lambs or any ism

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:03:15,890
yeah see we have to have complete

41
00:02:51,019 --> 00:03:17,930
integrated knowledge no no there is no

42
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,950
system about it there's no system no

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,970
practice no person actually it is for

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,819
take I am talking about few revolutions

45
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,000
your evolution comes through a living

46
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:36,560
force of the Living God you cannot have

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,930
a course in that can you not how do you

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,940
sprout the season you have to just put

49
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,220
it in the mother earth it sprouts myself

50
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:51,769
is building in the same way within you

51
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:54,530
it is building and it stops maybe you

52
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,519
may not get you today use it some seed

53
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,519
sprouts faster

54
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,700
is going out

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,580
nunim which is you're sadly mistaken

56
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,109
about Buddhism the trouble is with the

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,269
Western people they are so fed up with

58
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,650
Christianity that they think the visa

59
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,630
meals are going to solve the problem

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:28,290
that just like any other all these Lama

61
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:31,380
should be hanged by the neck here these

62
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,600
people they're horrible either vibration

63
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,060

won't understand that's how you don't

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,789
understand even a given child who the

73
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,910
realized soul will understand but you

74
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:05,310

will understand you won't understand

94
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,870
realized soul is a person

95
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,420

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,850
east on things yes said first of all see

97
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,800
yourself would that did he talk about

98
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,480
God why because he thought if you talk

99
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,990
about God again another religion in

100
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,120
stock

101
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,160

102
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,500
first of all teach yourself get yourself

103
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:15,460
knowledge nothing else but get your

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,640
realization or exactly so whether having

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,670
it better have it you seem to have good

106
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,240
reason there's nothing like that these

107
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,550
people are meant to have it means to get

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,650
realization what tradition are the

109
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,640
college carrying that ring like names

110
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:37,660
like that Matthew please that was

111
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,460
pathetic he thought his realization fit

112
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,220
into all these nonsensical things with

113
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,720
llamas and they even beat people and who

114
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,330

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,210
people have got their out of that NASA

116
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,950

117
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,900
sitting on our head like parasites in

118
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,000
England and we had a parliament question

119
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,430
on them you see they look very

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,980
attractive because you have fed up with

121
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,480
your this charity that's what don't

122
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,920
believe in all this please whether they

123
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,980
induce Christians who scream all are

124
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:11,580
doing nothing you become the realized

125
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,580
version

126
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,630
you have beat it all right that's what

127
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,110
I'm saying

128
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,110
as a mother

129
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,040

Shambhala business this is another new

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,010
thing taking everybody to go be there

132
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,419
and to get somebody walking that Kobe

133
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:37,450

can't live in an ordinary house you have

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,610
to make a motion so first you'll starve

161
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,470
ourselves within one year we collected

162
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,540

00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:51,390
world I am NOT mesmerised but must see

171
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,450
the sense

172
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,130
Oh how do we accept the good huh let's

173
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,730
see

174
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,730
have you seen Buddha

175
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,450
I will met him have you met anybody who

176
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:14,180
is a Buddhist who says he can give

177
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:19,040
realization but then why are we the

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:21,320
preachers of Buddha whom they have never

179
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,040
seen on the way we don't know anything

180
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,640
about him

181
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,410

182
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,580
was living there are people who were

183
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,390
asking about other people better be in

184
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,270
