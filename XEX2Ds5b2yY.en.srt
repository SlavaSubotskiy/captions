1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,320
If Rama came to be the greatest example of kingship,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,440
of fatherhood

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,200
and who gave society a tremendous base upon which to

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,920
establish the quality of dharma and family life,

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,999
then there had to be a power to sustain.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,200
That power was none other than Radha, than Sita.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,800
If Lord Krishna came to do the job of establishing within us

8
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:40,240
the potential consciousness

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,640
that we have to become the witness to the [drama] of life,

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,040
that we have to recognize the nature of the all-pervading God,

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,240
that we have to recognize the greatness of God

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,200
and that He has to watch His play,

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,440
and that we have to be like Him

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
and watch that play rather than become involved in it.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,080
If Shri Krishna came on the Earth

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,880
to establish the quality of divine diplomacy within us,

17
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:17,040
that we have to be sweet, that we have to,

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,880
in order to convince people have a certain essence of truth,

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,480
you may have to go about it in different ways, at different levels,

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,160
all of those sweet things that we know from Bhagavat Gita.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,000
There had to be a power to sustain. That power was Radha.

22
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:41,480
If Christ came to open the narrow gate,

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,480
if He came to absorb and dissolve and neutralize our ego,

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,999
He said: “I have died for your sins”.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
This means that He absorbs all of the wrong doings of the past

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,999
at the time of self Realization.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,000
If He came to be resurrected, to prove that the Spirit is eternal,

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,760
how did He do it, how did He go through the drama?

29
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,880
He was sustained again

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,240
by the power of his Mother,

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,999
who was none other than the primordial Mother Herself,

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
as the Mother Mary.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
So through the eternity of time, as the Mother of the Buddha,

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,880
as the wife of Hazrat Ali who was the husband of Fatima,

35
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,880
She incarnated at that time

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,480
to do that job of providing the sustaining force.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,999
But now what has happened today

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,999
is that same [Thy] has taken birth as a Mother,

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,999
to give us what Christ promised, our second birth.

40
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:59,240
The age of the father was an age of rough, of stern supervision.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
The age of the son, Christ,

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,999
was the age of nourishment, yes, but nourishment in the sense of

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,160
setting that quality of Sonship,

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,440
forgiveness, sacrifice

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,880
and slowly introducing the concept of the Mother.

46
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,999
And the final age of the Holy Ghost

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,999
spoken of by Joachim del Fiore and many other Catholic mystics.

48
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,240
The age of the Holy Ghost is now.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
And the one to do the job has to be none other than a Mother,

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,360
the same Primordial Mother as has been incarnating

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,999
over the eternity of time.

52
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:47,880
So Shri Mataji is here for one job.

53
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,080
She is here to awaken within you

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,440
that pure desire to be one with God.

55
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,040
That residual energy

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
which is sleeping,

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,960
but which in the presence of Her, or another realized soul,

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,999
awakens spontaneously and effortlessly and without any pain,

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,480
and gives you what you have been seeking for so many births.

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,400
The time has come. Mother uses the phrase that

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,920
on the Tree of Life, at first there were just a few flowers.

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,960
Now the blossom time has come.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,760
And all of those blossoms have to turn to fruit.

64
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:35,760
And this is why we are here. The fruiting is self Realization,

65
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,999
but it has to actualize, it has to happen.

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,040
So when it happens,

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,480
it manifests as I explained to you as these cool vibrations.

68
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
When you feel these cool vibrations,

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,999
you then are empowered with the all-pervading power of God.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,480
You can raise your own Kundalini, you can balance the energies,

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,840
you can clear the chakras in yourself and in others.

72
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,320
Through the collective consciousness that happens

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,440
you can know which center within you

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,320
is clear and which one is a little bit obstructed.

75
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,320
And you know in other people.

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
You can work it out in yourself, you can work it out in others.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
You can give the blessing to others.

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,880
As you get it, you can give it to others.

79
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,880
So it's a tremendous leap forward in our evolutionary cycle.

80
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,120
So from this limited, human awareness

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,320
we are now moving ahead

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
into a new dimension,

83
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,999
which has been promised, by all of the great incarnations.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,200
You become a Spiritual being.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,840
So on this last night, here in New York,

86
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,920
all of you should be absolutely in the mood of,

87
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
"I have to get something",

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,240
but not only get something, because most of you have got it,

89
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,040
but you have to as if “suck" those vibrations into your being,

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,160
into the very being which is this subtle body that lies within you.

91
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,880
Allow these centers to purify and to cleanse.

92
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,240
Allow the Kundalini to come up with greater and greater force.

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,400
And allow yourself to enjoy all of the blessings

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,720
of being one with the Spirit. Thank you very much.

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,480
And may I introduce you to again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,999
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

97
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:59,999
As Dr. Warren has told you, that the blossom time has come.

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,760
You could never have found so many seekers,

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,999
on this Earth,

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,120
say even before 50 years.

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,080
Suddenly so many seekers have been born,

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,880
who are seeking something beyond.

103
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,080
They are not satisfied with rationality,

104
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,480
with materialism, with all the ideologies given

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,720
by the people who talk that that we should be satisfied

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
with ourselves

107
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,760
as far as matter goes

108
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,080
or as far as mental projection is concerned.

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,280
They want to know that there must be something beyond.

110
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:02,000
And thus we find

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,240
there is a great

112
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:11,160
shopping center that has opened especially in your country,

113
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,280
of all those people who think they can surprise us.

114
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,280
That is one of the signs which were described even by Christ.

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,280
Of course in our country,

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,999
there are books and books written

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,120
about those people who will come here

118
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,200
as fake people and take full advantage of your seeking.

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Now the problem with the Western mind is this,

120
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,999
that it does not understand the dangers

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,480
of getting into all kinds of things,

122
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:53,120
and that is why they are really

123
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
[led] into things

124
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,280
where they should not have been.

125
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
And they have no knowledge also,

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,960
in a way what to expect

127
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
of themselves.

128
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,840
When they are seeking, what should be expected?

129
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,200
What should happen to us?

130
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,999
What is the criteria that we are realized souls?

131
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,999
Which is the way we can find out that we have got our Realization?

132
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:36,040
As it is, there is so much of book-knowledge, the worst,

133
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,840
as Shankaracharya calls as, calls it shabda jaalam,

134
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,760
the net of worse.

135
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,840
And people were lost in those words.

136
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,999
The books are there, the words are there,

137
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,160
and the people start thinking that

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,200
by reading these books or by understanding them mentally,

139
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,240
or some of them think by remembering by heart,

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
they will achieve their Realization.

141
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,360
That means Realization is only for people, who are able to read.

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,999
And what about the people who cannot read?

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,280
Are they not going to evolve?

144
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,999
Perhaps they are going to evolve much faster

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,999
than the people who can read.

146
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,880
Because they have no complications in their heads.

147
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,200
They are simple, straight forward people.

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,999
I've seen the example of that in India.

149
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,720
Not only that, but they are very sensitive.

150
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,720
It's because they live with the Mother Earth

151
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
They are extremely sensitive.

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,880
They know a tug, they know a cheat,

153
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,960
they know a hypocrite and they know the reality.

154
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,999
While where people live with artificialities,

155
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,880
with artificial love,

156
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,040
it's impossible for them to judge,

157
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,000
what is real and what is artificial.

158
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
As I told you before, that minimum of minimum,

159
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,999
you must cancel all the people who live on your money.

160
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
They are parasites, in simple words.

161
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
Or they may be your servants.

162
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,040
But they cannot be the people who can deliver the goods.

163
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
If they are poor, they live like poor people.

164
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,999
If they are rich, they live there, but absolutely detached.

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,160
Now, what should we expect?

166
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,040
What should happen to us,

167
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,760
when we say that "I have got Realization".

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,320
This is the point people do not know they are not educated in that.

169
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
They are naive about it,

170
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,000
and that's why people have taken full advantage of their ignorance.

171
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,240
I came ten years back,

172
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,880
and told them frankly about all these things, with names and things,

173
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,200
But they didn’t like Me.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,320
They said, "Why should You stop us from doing all these?"

175
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,880
I said, "Go ahead."

176
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,760
But now what I find most of them are lost.

177
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,999
They have just became like cabbages.

178
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
They are so mesmerized, they don’t know what they are doing,

179
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,120
where they have to go.

180
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,120
Now if the Spirit has to shine within us,

181
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,880
what should happen, what is Self Realization?

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Let’s see if there is a light in this room,

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,840
if you become the light, you don’t see the light.

184
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,120
But through that you can see everyone, the light can see everyone.

185
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,440
And what do you see? First you must see yourself.

186
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,160
You have never faced yourself.

187
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
People become mad.

188
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Till they are mad they don’t know that they are becoming mad.

189
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,400
They get cancers, their diseases in the body is crawling up.

190
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,200
They don’t know they got the disease, there’s any problem.

191
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,240
They just continue with the life, without understanding.

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,440
They have no way of finding out,

193
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,680
or diagnosis cannot be done by them.

194
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
But once you become the Spirit,

195
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,999
the Spirit when it emits through your fingers,

196
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,999
when you start feeling enlightenment of your fingertips,

197
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,080
you can feel what’s wrong with your chakras, means your centers.

198
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,680
Now somebody can decode it

199
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
and tell you, that this fingers means that,

200
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,080
this finger means that, this finger means that,

201
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,240
the combination and permutations of these seven centers,

202
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,960
one two, three four, five, six, seven, as shown here.

203
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,360
We have marked with the colors to show you

204
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,960
that how on the finger, hands,

205
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
feet have different, but hands,

206
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,800
you see the effect of those centers when you are enlightened.

207
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,999
Before that you cannot. Because you are like a computer.

208
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,880
You are really a computer, otherwise

209
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,280
also if you want to see rationally

210
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,240
that you see something and you don’t think about it, but you see.

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,120
What a perfect computer you are already.

212
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,880
But the computer becomes

213
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,999
a part and parcel of your awareness.

214
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
You sort of become the master of that computer

215
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,960
so that you can understand the decoding,

216
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,999
and the maneuvering of all the processes of that computer.

217
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,760
This computer is beautifully made,

218
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,999
Is very beautifully made as you can see it.

219
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,840
Is not a mix bag,

220
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,880
as most of the psychologists believe

221
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,200
that you have to go to the subconscious,

222
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
to get to the higher super consciousness.

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,840
Here you can see on the left hand side

224
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,040
is the subconscious and the collective subconscious.

225
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,920
On the right hand side you have got this supraconscious

226
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,999
that is the future and the collective supraconscious.

227
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,280
Down below is what you call the hell,

228
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,999
and on top is the superconsciousness.

229
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,120
To rise there is a passage kept very firmly.

230
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,120
You have to pass through these centers

231
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,999
and whatever problems are in the centers

232
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,840
if you start feeling on your fingertips and know how to cure them,

233
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,999
you can make your Kundalini rise very nicely and establish Agnya.

234
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,800
All these knowledge can be yours, very easily,

235
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,999
but the first thing is that you have to get your Realization.

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Unless and until there is light,

237
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,999
and if I tell you, this is not a snake, this is just a cord,

238
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
you are not going to believe it.

239
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:30,840
The light has to come to give you the complete idea about yourself,

240
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,480
so you know yourself.

241
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,960
First of all you must know physically what is wrong.

242
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,120
Secondly you must know what's wrong with you mentally.

243
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,200
Now people who are ego oriented.

244
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,880
They torture others, they aggress others,

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,800
but they don’t know that they are full of ego.

246
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,880
The people who are superego,

247
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,480
means those who take tortures upon others,

248
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,800
they start indulging into their miseries

249
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,880
and start saying, "I must suffer,

250
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,999
I must have done something wrong, so I must suffer".

251
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,120
They accept that kind of a life.

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,120
But after Realization you understand

253
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,200
that you are not your ego or superego, but you are your Self.

254
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,999
And you are not to suffer, nor do you have to aggress anyone.

255
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,840
Nor you have to take aggression from anyone,

256
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:24,480
but you stand in the center, as the light.

257
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,840
You have to just have to just

258
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,400
have the source of joy flowing into you.

259
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,280
All the time you have to get connected to the whole,

260
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,320
so that you are looked after by the whole.

261
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,000
You become part and parcel of the whole. You are part and parcel,

262
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,999
but you are not aware. You become aware of it.

263
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
So the first thing happens to you

264
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,240
that you come to know about your physical side and

265
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
mental side, whether you are emotional

266
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,440
or whether you are ego oriented.

267
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Then you start in the center.

268
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,760
When I’m talking to you

269
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,440
maybe you are thinking of your past

270
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,400
or maybe you are thinking about of you future at this time.

271
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,920
But if I say that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

272
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,840
Your attention is outside.

273
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,880
That is why this happening takes place,

274
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,320
which attracts your attention inside.

275
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:20,120
And when the attention is attracted inside,

276
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,080
then you start seeing yourself clearly,

277
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
understanding yourself, "That is the matter with me".

278
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,999
What's wrong with the world today is wrong with every individual.

279
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,999
If the individuals improve, the whole world is going to improve.

280
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,999
So physically and mentally you get perfectly all right.

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,999
All kinds of diseases can be cured by Sahaja Yoga;

282
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,360
you can cure yourself, I don’t have to cure you.

283
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,920
Because you become empowered by that.

284
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,999
Secondly, you also know what is wrong with you, Spiritually.

285
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,720
Supposing you have been to a wrong guru,

286
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,999
supposing you have been mesmerized by a wrong person,

287
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,080
now how are you going to know

288
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,400
whether he is wrong or a right person?

289
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,360
How will you find out? Supposing Christ comes stands before you,

290
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,040
how will you recognize Christ?

291
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,200
Have you any way of finding out?

292
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
Anybody who talks sweetly

293
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,120
has all these professional methods of enticing you,

294
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,120
you can fall a pray to that.

295
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,840
But after Realization you find from your hand

296
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,200
a new kind of a vibratory awareness is going.

297
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
Through these vibrations you can find out

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,040
whether the person is false, hypocritical or a devil.

299
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,800
If he is a devil you might even get blisters on your hand.

300
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,760
And that's how you correct your Spiritual

301
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,160
seeking when you have gone wrong.

302
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
If you know how to correct it,

303
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,680
the methods which are very simple, the movement of your hands,

304
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
you can get out of that.

305
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,840
Many people as you must have known, that who have been to cults,

306
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:08,360
had fake gurus, have suffered. They have become like cabbages.

307
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,440
But all those people can be saved if they get their Realization

308
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,200
and gradually understand their power of getting out of it.

309
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,960
Because Spirit is self-powered, it works on itself.

310
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,720
So first of all you know about yourself.

311
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,999
As a result of that, you drop off all your habits.

312
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,999
Supposing there is a black spot on my sari,

313
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,999
I cannot see and I am identified with it,

314
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,999
so anybody tells me there is black spot, I won’t like it.

315
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,999
But supposing I can see it, then I clean it myself.

316
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,240
When the nectar or ambrosia of God’s love starts flowing in you,

317
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,960
you just don’t need to drink, you just don't need to smoke,

318
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,440
you are no more a slave of any habits.

319
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
You just become a free bird.

320
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,999
That’s the real freedom, that nothing can entice you,

321
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
nothing can enslave you.

322
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,760
You become so integrated that if you don’t want it,

323
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,440
you just don’t want it. Then your body will support you,

324
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
your mind will support you, your Spirit will support you.

325
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,440
You are completely integrated at that point.

326
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,240
That is the first thing happens to you,

327
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,999
as a person who comes to Sahaja Yoga;

328
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,120
I’ve seen many of them, were alcoholics.

329
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,999
We have some artists in India, were great alcoholics.

330
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,680
Very great artists. They came to Sahaja Yoga

331
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,480
and they dropped their habits.

332
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
They dropped them completely.

333
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,480
They were amazed. Next day they dropped it.

334
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,080
Because once you get the test

335
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,880
of this great understanding that you are the Spirit,

336
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:01,040
you just become so powerful that nothing can overpower you.

337
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,440
It has happened with many.

338
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,680
Now only thing is that,

339
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,999
what is the use, people ask Me, of becoming.

340
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,760
The becoming is actually, is the epitome of your evolution.

341
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,480
You have to do it. You cannot avoid it. If not today, tomorrow.

342
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,080
If you don’t accept it,

343
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,800
then you'll have to face the consequences.

344
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,920
But you have to become the Spirit.

345
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,480
The another very great thing it happens,

346
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,999
that the light that you have, gives light to others.

347
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,880
You can enlighten their lights.

348
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,160
Their candles are not yet ready,

349
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,999
then you know how to put them right.

350
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,400
You can enlighten their lights with your light,

351
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,999
without obliging them.

352
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,999
Like the sun shines.

353
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,200
It doesn’t say "I’m shinning, I’m doing all this,

354
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,240
I’m creating chlorophyll". It doesn’t. It just shines.

355
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,040
But we can say that it doesn’t do any work,

356
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,200
or we say he does non-work, a-karma.

357
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,640
In the same way it starts flowing through your being,

358
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
just working out.

359
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,280
And anybody says, "Mother, I am thankful", I’m surprised.

360
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,999
Because if you are a part and parcel of My being,

361
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,880
if this is my finger, if I try to soothe My finger,

362
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,400
is not going to thank Me.

363
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,480
In the same way, there is not the other left,

364
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,840
you just start feeling another person upon your fingertips.

365
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,999
That means you become again collectively conscious,

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,400
and later on as you grow you become cosmic conscious.

367
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:56,840
That means that you know how to handle even the elements.

368
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:00,320
But first you have to become collectively conscious.

369
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,920
When you become collectively conscious,

370
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,999
suddenly a tremendous compassion and love starts growing in you.

371
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,880
You feel so nourished yourself that you want to give.

372
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:14,000
You have so much that the charity just

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,240
makes you feel that you should give.

374
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,880
And when this charity starts flowing,

375
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:22,160
then you are amazed how it works.

376
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,760
We invite people to our house to create good relationships.

377
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,600
We give them food, we give them this, try to make good relationship.

378
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,840
Here the relationship is spontaneous.

379
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,920
You don’t have to say about it, it just exists.

380
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,920
You feel it that is there.

381
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,320
I’ll give you an example of a girl who went to Sicily

382
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,000
and she was feeling very lonely she said

383
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,640
"now what am I to talk to these people, you see,

384
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,200
there is nobody here who is a realized soul".

385
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,040
She was feeling very lonely.

386
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,200
Suddenly she felt some vibrations around her.

387
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
She turn around and she saw another lady sitting there.

388
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,440
She said, “Are you the child of Mother?"

389
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,160
She just got up and grasped her, she said “Yes, I am".

390
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,160
"I could feel your vibration, you could feel mine"

391
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,880
And just they understood each other,

392
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,760
that they were, they had never met before,

393
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,160
their language is very different,

394
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,920
they were from two different countries,

395
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,880
they had nothing to do with each other.

396
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,120
But the love and understanding, that they had,

397
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,840
that all these identifications drop off,

398
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,440
that you are an Italian,

399
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,040
or you are an Indian, or you are an American

400
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
you become a human being,

401
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,720
and a super human being who can feel others.

402
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,080
This knowledge is not new.

403
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,040
It was a secret knowledge for some time.

404
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
In the sixth century in our country, a great incarnation came

405
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,280
as Adi Shankaracharya and he talked about it openly.

406
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,999
And after that also, we had many poets who talked about it.

407
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,720
Hundred years back, William Blake came in.

408
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,880
And he said all about it, so clearly, he's such a seer,

409
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,800
that he beats all the sears, everywhere.

410
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:05,120
The amount of precision he has used,

411
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,880
because perhaps he felt

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,360
that if Western mind has to understand, they need precision.

413
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,360
Even My house he has described, exact place he has described.

414
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,920
Even what Sahaja Yogis will be doing,

415
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,240
where our ashram will be in London, what places I’ll be visiting,

416
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,720
I mean to such a detailed thing.

417
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,960
And surprisingly, we discovered all these

418
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,880
after we have been to that place, after we have done it.

419
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,480
Like in London, we had our ashram,

420
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,880
and it was a very dilapidated house, bombed.

421
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:41,800
That he has written down. It will be a house, ruined house,

422
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,480
because people didn’t have so much money.

423
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,120
So, and then I laid the foundation.

424
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,999
And he said "the foundation will be laid in Lambert,

425
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,160
come to Lambert.

426
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,440
Her sinews vibrated. He used the word "Her" all the time.

427
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,720
And the clear cut picture he has given.

428
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,080
But people called him crazy, that he is a psychological case.

429
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,440
Because they don’t have that super consciousness to understand.

430
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,320
But if you ask any Sahaja Yogi, he understands him very well.

431
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,999
So even only 100 years back, there was someone who talked about Me.

432
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,800
I would say 70 years back, somebody talked about Me, in India.

433
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:23,040
But people at 14 000 years back, have also talked about Sahaja Yoga.

434
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,800
So you can imagine that it is not

435
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,880
that today I've just started coming out of the blue,

436
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and some sort of a neo business has started.

437
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
It`s a traditional growth,

438
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
in a very traditional way,

439
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,999
respecting all the establishments, not to demolish anything.

440
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,880
But whatever is not correct, drops out by itself.

441
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:50,840
All that is useless drops out by itself.

442
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:55,640
In the living process, even a flower has to drop out its [chalis]

443
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,480
if it has to become the fruit.

444
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,360
In the same way everything works out so naturally, the way it grows,

445
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,999
that you are amazed that at the end of it you remain pure Spirit.

446
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,440
Your eyes become innocent. There is no lust and greed in it.

447
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,320
What Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes",

448
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
that innocence is awakened within you

449
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,960
and you just become, become innocent.

450
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,000
Becoming innocent is not possible otherwise,

451
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,120
but you just become innocent.

452
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
You become really childlike.

453
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Your whole attitude towards life becomes childlike.

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,880
Now some people may say that, "When people become like that, Mother,

455
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,999
then what happens to our business?"

456
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,800
There was a girl in San Francisco,

457
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,040
an Indian girl who had married another Indian.

458
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,800
And they were having a shop. And she said:"After realization Mother,

459
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:53,720
I forgot about counting this, that, I was very meticulous.

460
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,880
But I never made any profits."

461
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,400
But now I’m told that they have made so many profits,

462
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,920
they are no more there, that they have 14 stores all over New York.

463
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,999
So how things [help] you and work it out when you leave it to God,

464
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,240
because He is thousand fold more efficient.

465
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,999
I mean He is absolutely, we cannot compare Him to ourselves,

466
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,760
because He is perfect.

467
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:25,280
Everything is perfect, but you must enter into His Kingdom.

468
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,120
If i don’t come to America, how will I know how Americans operate?

469
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,120
When I have come here, then only I’ve come to know.

470
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,880
But if you see God's realm is such, that when you enter it,

471
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:43,200
you feel you are looked after every moment.

472
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,040
How He guides you, how He watches you,

473
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,320
in the smallest way and in the biggest way, it's most surprising.

474
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,999
It's not easy to understand His ways.

475
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,600
One of the examples, I don’t know, if Warren has told you.

476
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,999
Did you tell them about the Bedford example, Warren? No.

477
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,880
I must tell you this one, so that you’ll

478
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,800
understand His ways are so great.

479
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:09,040
I was in Bedford one night, and we had about 600 people there.

480
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,400
I was speaking to them, about 7 o’clock I was there,

481
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,960
till about 10 o’clock.

482
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,880
At 8 o’clock about 10-15 miles away, one boy fell down in a ditch,

483
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,160
in a sense that there was a bridge and he fell down very low,

484
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,680
with his motorcycle.

485
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,920
And when they sent for the ambulance,

486
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,440
he just walked up and came out,

487
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
so they were quite surprised that how could he come.

488
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,880
So they took him in the ambulance to the hospital,

489
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,680
and the police also came.

490
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,999
Then he told them, that "A lady, Indian lady

491
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,880
came in a white car - I have a white car -

492
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:49,960
and She came down and She healed me completely".

493
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,800
But She said that, "At the base of the spine there is still problem,

494
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,360
you come and see me at my house."

495
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,120
And She went away. But the people who were there, they said,

496
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,080
"We saw no car, we saw no lady coming here.

497
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,000
What is he talking about?"

498
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
So they noted down everything and next day,

499
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,040
because he was completely all right, they were surprised,

500
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,840
falling from that distance, nothing had happened.

501
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,920
He saw My photograph in the newspaper,

502
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,880
and then he said, "This is the lady".

503
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:19,280
And that was at 8 o’clock when I was speaking to so many people.

504
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,880
So they were quite surprised when he went and told the police,

505
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:26,240
and he told the hospital people, that they informed the newspaper.

506
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,880
And newspaper people wrote to us

507
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:33,920
and one of our Sahaja Yogis, answered back,

508
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,999
and the whole thing was in the newspaper.

509
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,880
And they were quite amazed at it.

510
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,720
Now how this has happened. You may say how can this happen, Mother?

511
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,800
It can happen, because as you have got television,

512
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,080
God has tremendous organization of television.

513
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
He has all telecommunication, everything.

514
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,120
Don’t think that you can only produce these, these are dead.

515
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,920
These are good for nothing.

516
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,440
His working is so great that tat-kshane, at that moment.

517
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,999
As soon as you see, as soon as you speak

518
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
as soon as you desire, it works out.

519
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,080
Even if somebody just desires,

520
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,040
and he is a man looked after God,

521
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,760
even he may not be a realized soul. He is helped in such a way.

522
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,320
Now then after that they described all such

523
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,960
happenings that took place in India, and everywhere.

524
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,720
But what I am trying to say,

525
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,440
that we are so much proud of what our achievements are.

526
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,999
These achievements are nothing, compared to what God has for you.

527
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,920
In His realm once you enter,

528
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,440
actually you yourself become so beautiful,

529
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,400
you yourself become such a dynamic, beautiful, silent flame of love,

530
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,960
that you are not bothered at all as to what is happening around,

531
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,999
what is going wrong, you don’t get upset with it.

532
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,240
You are silently watching all this joke, all this drama,

533
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,240
hoping that one day, the rest of the world

534
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,120
will also become realized,

535
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,440
and the rest of the world will also enjoy the blessings of God.

536
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,080
This is what is desired by every Sahaja Yogi,

537
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,920
and that's why they forced Me to come to America,

538
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,920
that I should come and speak to people here.

539
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,160
So we must understand what are the barriers within us,

540
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,040
not to understand Divinity

541
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,120
Why we cannot understand Divinity?

542
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,800
First of all we have had no education.

543
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:40,080
Whatever education we have had was about the tree that is outside.

544
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,880
But we have no education about the roots, doesn’t matter.

545
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,280
To go to the roots, you have to become subtle.

546
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,999
When you get Realization you enter into the roots,

547
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,080
and the knowledge becomes yours in no time.

548
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,960
You don’t need much time to know about it,

549
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,360
because you become the light and through that light you can see.

550
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,120
Like you must have seen these people who work in the mines, you see,

551
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,880
they have a light placed here

552
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,400
and through that they can see everything.

553
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,440
In the same way you become the light, you don’t see the light,

554
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,999
You become the light, and in that light you see everything.

555
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,240
Now, when this happens to you,

556
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,999
your attention, as I told you, becomes collective.

557
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,080
Your attention starts feel another personality,

558
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,880
another person, another person’s, another people,

559
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,840
and you start understanding what the problem is.

560
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,840
And you can help them,

561
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,440
by just doing some sort of a blessing, as you say,

562
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,200
and you can work it out.

563
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,880
But there are people who are unwise.

564
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,800
In this world, there are people who are stupid.

565
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,240
They need not be educated.

566
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,800
Educated people also can be very unwise people.

567
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:59,200
They need not be very intelligent,

568
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,080
or they may be intelligent,

569
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,240
but wisdom is an innate quality in a person.

570
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,000
If they are wise enough,

571
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,999
they know how to handle the situation, to understand themselves

572
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,720
and they settle down in Sahaja Yoga in no time.

573
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,080
But those who are not so wise, take time.

574
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,040
So one has to understand that we have to have perseverance about it

575
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,720
we have to settle down into it, absolutely master it,

576
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,280
because you become the master.

577
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,800
That’s the point is, you become the master of yourself

578
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,840
you don`t need any guru. You become the master.

579
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,960
As I will tell you, the left and the right, is here.

580
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,880
We can compare it to the brake and the accelerator of a car.

581
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,480
Left side is the brake

582
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
- Gregoire later you do it, because you see,

583
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,320
people have attention very much confused.

584
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,440
If you get up immediately their eyes go there.

585
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,760
We should keep, you see, he is just taking a photograph.

586
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,440
We have seen so many people in this world.

587
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,999
For a change, keep your attention little concentrated.

588
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,080
But it will happen.

589
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,720
It will happen, once you get your Realization,

590
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,999
your attention will be very, very nicely placed.

591
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,760
Now, when you people know that this has happened to you,

592
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,280
and when you become the master,

593
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:22,200
you know the brake and the accelerator in you.

594
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,160
But still, actually you are not the master,

595
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,999
you are still the driver.

596
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,320
And when you are a driver, you automatically do it driving,

597
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,240
but still one should not say that you are a driver.

598
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,920
You know the balancing of it, you know how to maneuver it,

599
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,999
how to act.

600
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:44,999
But then, what happens? To become the master, what do you do?

601
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,480
This Realization takes place.

602
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,320
Then you become the master, and you see the driver,

603
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,360
you see the accelerator, and you see the brake in yourself.

604
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,080
And you just enjoy like a master.

605
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,920
When you become the master, you cannot be slave of anything.

606
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,480
No more slavery, the real freedom lies

607
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
in becoming the master of yourself.

608
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,880
No use mastering others, just master yourself.

609
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,880
But that mastering cannot be done by lecturing

610
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,880
or by brainwashing, or by talking to you,

611
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,960
but it's a happening that has to take place.

612
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,960
The Kundalini has to rise and has to give you Realization.

613
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,999
This, unless and until this happens we should not say that we know.

614
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Know, knowledge is not, when we are not one with the Divine.

615
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:39,200
It’s like a machine or you can say telephone not connected.

616
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,240
We have to get our connection first, establish the connection,

617
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,800
and then we become the knower.

618
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,760
And the knowledge becomes a part and parcel of you.

619
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,600
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

620
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,440
It’s not meant for stupid at all,

621
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,760
neither for the cowardly.

622
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,999
It is meant for people who are courageous,

623
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,999
who are people of wisdom,

624
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,880
who are not given to nonsensical things easily.

625
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:12,200
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are two forces working all the time.

626
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,480
You may get your Realization today here,

627
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,999
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it. I won’t guarantee that.

628
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,999
The reason is, we have two forces,

629
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,999
one is centripetal and another is centrifugal.

630
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,200
By one force you are attracted towards it,

631
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
by another force you are thrown out.

632
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,200
Because you have come out of matter.

633
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
And the matter tries to drag you down.

634
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,999
You have to master it,

635
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,800
in such a way that the Spirit sits on the top of the matter.

636
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,999
And the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

637
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,080
And for that you have to meditate, and you will be in meditation.

638
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,480
It's simple thing to be done, there’s nothing difficult.

639
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,880
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

640
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:55,240
Sahaja also means, it means also a simple, easy.

641
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,920
But "saha-ja", saha means with,

642
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,920
"ja" means born, is born with you.

643
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,960
But today this is called in India as Maha Yoga.

644
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,880
Because before this, all the Realizations

645
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,040
took place of course through Sahaj only,

646
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,999
by Kundalini awakening. There is no other way.

647
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,400
Only Kundalini awakening is the way you get your Realization.

648
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,680
Like some people said, there must be some another way.

649
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,999
There is none. Because like a seed has to sprout

650
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,880
through the primule only, in the same way, in your case,

651
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:27,320
in human beings, the Kundalini has to rise to give you Realization.

652
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,840
There’s no other way, but this.

653
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,880
It is called as Sahaja method, means spontaneous method.

654
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,880
But today it is called as Maha Yoga,

655
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:38,320
because you`ll find thousands of people get Realization.

656
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,920
People who have been with Me in the villages of India,

657
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,440
have seen 6000, 8000 people gathered.

658
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,880
I mean in New York we have so many people, see how many have come.

659
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:50,880
But if you go to a village, one village in India,

660
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,120
you’ll be surprised, people will be pouring on their bullock carts,

661
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,640
" There, Mataji has come".

662
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,920
Because they know, and in that atmosphere, you see,

663
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,320
the fragrance of this good news spreads so fast,

664
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,720
spreads so fast, because that’s the atmosphere for that.

665
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,440
But where there is so much of mental activity,

666
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,999
nothing can penetrate.

667
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,120
They cannot see, they have no sensitivity to visualize

668
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,999
what is good for them and what is not.

669
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,999
So the last chakra is of the 7-th,

670
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,760
all the 7 chakras are in the last chakra.

671
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,240
And that's how you get complete integrated.

672
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,880
Your emotional being, your mental being,

673
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:33,440
your physical being, your spiritual being completely integrated.

674
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,880
You go beyond time. You are not bothered about time at all.

675
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,880
If you say "Mother, when will get Realization?

676
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,999
I say "Just now". That's the point is.

677
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,360
But if you don’t get it, all right. If you get it, just now.

678
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,920
This Kundalini rises in a split of a second,

679
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
like a jet it goes out of your head.

680
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,080
But with so many people it just struggles [for days].

681
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
She is there at the base just trying to come up.

682
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,999
It's very difficult sometimes.

683
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,680
I've seen some Kundalinis in such a bad shape

684
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
that it horrifies Me. What we have done to ourselves?

685
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:08,400
By this kind of a tomfoolery, "What is wrong? What is wrong?",

686
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,440
going into this and going into that,

687
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,760
we have really ruined our chances of our evolution.

688
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,880
And then you say you are seeking.

689
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:19,840
How to help people? You have already weakened yourself so much.

690
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,440
It takes time.

691
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,080
It’s one of my concerns, that so many saints

692
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,160
are born in this country, are born in the West.

693
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,840
But where are they lost, what has happened to them?

694
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,999
Why do they take so much time to take to reality?

695
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,360
They are driven to any fake guru

696
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,720
to any fake person who is making money,

697
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,999
who has got Rolls Royces, this, that.

698
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,120
Why should it impress you so much, I can’t understand.

699
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,999
Like a newspaper I went to, and they said,

700
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,800
"How many Rolls Royce She has got?"

701
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,080
They said, "She has no Rolls Royces".

702
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,800
Then they said, "We are not interested". Imagine!

703
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,120
Such a thing happening in your country is absolutely absurd,

704
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,160
that such a thing should happen to people who are intelligent,

705
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,999
that God cannot be purchased,

706
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,680
He cannot be paid in Rolls Royces and all these material things.

707
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,960
They are nothing to Him, they are not equal to the dust of His feet.

708
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,120
And what is there to give up? Some people talk

709
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,280
that you must give up this and give up that.

710
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
When you are not holding to anything, what is there to give up?

711
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,440
All these nonsensical ideas,

712
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,600
that you give up this for God, give up that.

713
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,240
God doesn't want all these nonsensical things you give to yourself.

714
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,960
But what happens, you get out of it.

715
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,280
A thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off.

716
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
When you are in the thought, you are materialistic

717
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:41,760
you are mentally thinking and all those things happening.

718
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,800
But in the center is a little space,

719
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:46,999
which is called in Sanskrit as vilamba.

720
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,320
When you rise above that,

721
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,720
then neither you are in the future nor in the past.

722
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,640
You are above time.

723
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,999
You are absolutely detached.

724
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,320
You start seeing the whole thing as a joke.

725
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,999
And then you become a real dynamic person.

726
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,160
And you create things which are superb and eternal.

727
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,800
Like I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

728
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:09,120
Michelangelo was another realized soul.

729
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,440
They created all those things because they were realized souls.

730
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,160
They could go out and see for themselves what’s happening.

731
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,999
All the great geniuses who have lust,

732
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,440
all useless, vulgar, cheap type have fallen.

733
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,920
They do not stand, they cannot stand the test of time.

734
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,400
They have all gone out. See, Christ came 2000 years back.

735
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,080
How many artists from 2000 years back, have stood the test of time?

736
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:37,280
He is still there. He is still there.

737
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,040
Why? Because He was genuine.

738
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,880
He was real. What He said was the truth.

739
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:44,880
That's why He is still there.

740
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,160
And that's what we have to understand that once you become

741
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,240
that genuine Self, that is you,

742
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,160
the beauty, the glory within you.

743
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
Then you don’t have to worry, you never perish,

744
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,120
you get into the eternal life.

745
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,080
Now there is no end to my talking. I’ve been talking

746
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,400
for now, at least one and a half month continuously.

747
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,880
Apart from that I was 21 days out in tour in Europe,

748
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:13,160
just 2 days in between, and again I came here.

749
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,880
I have given so many lectures, that in London if you go,

750
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:18,600
you’ll find thousands of them.

751
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,999
I have spoken individually about ego, superego,

752
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,999
all these things, about chakras, all the details about it,

753
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,280
and I’ve gone through all the details.

754
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,920
But in these 3 days whatever I could cover, I've tried to tell you,

755
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,040
and I also allowed you to ask questions.

756
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,360
But yesterday as you know, some stupid people came in

757
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
and tried to disturb Me. Now look at them.

758
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,680
There is, I can’t understand that,

759
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,480
because their daughter telephoned to Me, today also,

760
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,720
that her father has gone to work, he is not there.

761
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,680
So they are cheating their daughter,

762
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,640
coming and disturbing others.

763
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,720
Abd why are they doing this?

764
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,880
Why don’t they understand their child?

765
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,280
They don’t believe in God, but the child believes in God,

766
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,160
let the child, because that child is free now, in this country.

767
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
You should allow the child to know about the God.

768
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,920
Even supposing she does wrong, I say even if it is a cult,

769
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,080
how can you stop? But they can’t see the point.

770
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,999
That the point is, she is a different category of a person.

771
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,280
She’s a person who’s a seeker. She has to seek.

772
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,240
Even if she is making mistakes, they cannot stop it,

773
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,999
that is her nature.

774
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,640
She will never stop, till she has found it.

775
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,800
Because that is a special category.

776
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,999
She is not a mundane type of materialistic personality

777
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,999
who can take just to anything.

778
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,800
She is a person who is a seeker. I know they have done mistakes,

779
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:38,600
they have gone to cults, they have ruined themselves,

780
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,880
whatever it is.

781
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,040
But she’ll be born again and again and will be seeking.

782
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,800
Because she is a person who is a seeker,

783
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:48,999
is a very special category,

784
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,160
and that say, special category is at the epitome of evolution.

785
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,360
The mundane type of vulgar, loafer type of people,

786
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
are not meant for God.

787
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,880
He is not bothered about that, just a waste product.

788
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,040
The people who are seekers are only under His grace

789
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,440
and He is only worried and concerned about them

790
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,080
and not about the people

791
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,960
who maybe are occupying very big positions or anything,

792
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,480
I mean My husband is in the, you know,

793
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,160
he is a secretary general and all that,

794
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,800
but i never went to the UN, at all.

795
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,999
I said, "I have nothing to do with your", It has nothing to do,

796
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,760
because this is a special category of people.

797
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,999
They will meet Me here, that`s what it is.

798
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,160
One has to understand that is not what family you come from,

799
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,999
what nationality you come from, or what color you have,

800
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,999
what education you have had,

801
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,680
but what kind of a being, the inner being you have, is important.

802
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,160
If that is the seeker, then you get your Realization.

803
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,160
May God bless you all.

804
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,960
Now can you ask Me some questions?

805
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,960
If you want to, but don’t try to dominate Me, that’s not good.

806
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,160
Yesterday they misbehaved to such an extent.

807
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,760
What happened? Is all right?

808
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,160
SM: She has come?
SY: Yes she is here.

809
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,240
She's come, she told the police.

810
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,120
SY: She's just sitting there quietly with her mother.

811
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,999
SM: Where?

812
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,000
SY: Any questions? Yes.

813
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,200
Q: Shri Mataji, when you spoke

814
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,240
SM: Yes he is asking it.

815
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,800
Q: all about the people from Your country

816
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:28,440
who came to our country the United States,

817
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,920
as teachers who, who are [unclear] false teachers

818
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,000
and not very [unclear] and not realized, not realized.

819
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,960
Are there any in Your country or in our country as teachers

820
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,960
who do respect and [unclear] are realized people?

821
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,999
SY: You’ve spoken of teachers and gurus who come from your country,

822
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,720
who are either false teachers or not realized.

823
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,600
Are there [unclear] are realized?

824
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,880
SM: There are many, but they don`t want to come. Let`s sit.

825
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:03,480
Q: I mean are there any...

826
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,640
Agree that, I understand.

827
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,360
There are many real ones also in India.

828
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,000
They know about My work.

829
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:20,680
There are many who are real gurus in India.

830
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,400
And they know about My work. They respect Me very much.

831
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:27,400
And I asked one of them,

832
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,880
who was [real] one, to come to United States,

833
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:33,760
because I could not come, it's dangerous.

834
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,880
He just refused first of all.

835
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:39,320
But he [unclear] and within 3 days he ran away.

836
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,000
He said "They'll never understand me".

837
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,999
Mother they want me to wear some horns. He would not stay.

838
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,999
So they are. There are many who are real gurus,

839
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,920
but they are hiding themselves in the hills and vales.

840
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,000
And they are very strict people, I'm afraid they are not [for us].

841
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,240
[unclear]

842
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,480
"Because we have worked very hard to become like this

843
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,280
and these people want to take advantage of our achievements

844
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,999
[unclear].

845
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,000
There is one called as Narendra Maharaj because [unclear].

846
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,320
They say [unclear] and poor person

847
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,080
his legs and hands were broken by other people, you see.

848
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,880
That's what they do [unclear].

849
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:28,240
Till the person [unclear]

850
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,160
and they always trouble the right people.

851
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,320
So I went to see him, because he was telling people,

852
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,680
that "Now, Mother has come, so why do you want to [trouble me]?

853
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,400
Go and see Her".

854
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:43,800
And he told Me that, "If anybody troubles you Mother

855
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:45,880
send him over to me".

856
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
I didn't know he was such a straight man, Myself.

857
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,800
So there was one fellow who was torturing My life,

858
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,999
in the program often he used to come and ask such questions and,

859
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,800
very funny type. So I told him, [unclear].

860
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:02,800
[unclear] to Maharashtra.

861
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:05,760
He thought, "Oh, Mother [unclear]

862
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,400
I went to see him.

863
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,160
After one month I saw him, he was sitting like this

864
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,880
in the passage, [unclear].

865
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,999
And this fellow had put his legs on his neck and was juggling.

866
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,320
And people brought him [unclear].

867
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,240
The whole thing was horrifing, tears came into My eyes.

868
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,360
I said, "What's the matter?"

869
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,640
He said, "Mother, I must tell you what has happened to me,

870
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,880
[unclear]

871
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:32,080
"What happened?" "I went to that guru".

872
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,720
"Then why? What happened?

873
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,400
He said, "I just told [unclear] things against You".

874
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,880
I said, "What did you tell him?"

875
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:38,999
I just said that, "She gives Realization

876
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,720
to every Tom, Dick and Harry and She should be careful

877
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,800
[unclear] all kinds of things like this.

878
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,880
He said, "You are wiser than Mother, are you?"

879
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,440
And that's all he said and I slept off.

880
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,320
In the night he [unclear] a tiger

881
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,640
so the tiger pushed me into a ditch

882
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,200
and then I fell down, about 3 feet down.

883
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,280
and I broke my legs.

884
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,000
And then he locks up

885
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,999
[unclear]

886
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,240
about three inch [unclear]. He said, "Now, eat it".

887
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,000
I was there for 5-6 days like that.

888
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,999
Then he sent somebody to pick me up,

889
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,840
they wanted to [unclear], treat me

890
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:19,040
and then they said, "Now see our guru". So they brought him there.

891
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,360
He said, "Now you take his legs and put them in your neck

892
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,999
and [unclear] to your Mother. She is your guru, not me".

893
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,080
I was a really shocked at it.

894
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,040
Another fellow, a doctor used [to think] no end of himself,

895
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,680
and he tried to argue much with Me

896
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,640
so I said, "You go and see [unclear]".

897
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
So he went to see him.

898
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:39,640
And when he went to see him, you see,

899
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,160
he told him some sort of a thing, I don't know what he told him,

900
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,200
but when he came back I saw he was looking thin.

901
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,880
So I said, "Why [unclear]. What has happened?

902
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:52,240
He said, "Every day I had to carry seven miles,

903
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,999
two buckets of water". [unclear]

904
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,640
I said, "But for what?"

905
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,960
He said "That's what You said [unclear] do like this.

906
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,880
So I asked this man, I said, "Why did you do like that?"

907
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:08,600
He said, "For a donkey, he must be [brought] this way.

908
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,960
You are too kind.

909
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,999
They don't know how much we have [worked].

910
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,800
They are extremely strict people, I've seen that.

911
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:17,040
They beat their disciples sometimes.

912
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,960
Another one I've met, was called as [unclear], something like that.

913
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,800
And he lived [unclear].

914
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:26,999
And he came to see Me in another place called Ambarnath,

915
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,440
where his disciple was living [unclear].

916
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,960
And this disciple took Me to see him there,

917
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,040
in the ashram that he had.

918
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,760
And he, as soon as we entered, you see

919
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,880
[unclear] his disciple told me,

920
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:48,040
"Mataji, my guru [unclear], very badly".

921
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,720
So I went there, he touched My Feet and all.

922
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,640
I said, "Why did you beat him?

923
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,320
He said, you know when going [unclear] he was smoking.

924
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,880
So I hit him hard".

925
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,880
Then I said, "Really you should not have done it.

926
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,480
If you give him Realization then he won't.

927
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,320
But his Agnya chakra is catching.

928
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,920
And the Agnya chakra is catching, so poor fellow, you see,

929
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,320
he does not know to get rid of it, so he's smoking

930
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,440
He said, "Who cleared my Agnya chakra?

931
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,000
I cleared mine for years together, I've worked hard.

932
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,680
Why should I [unclear]?

933
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,320
I said, "This is five minutes job".

934
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,999
"For You this is five minutes job".

935
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,960
I cleared his Agnya chakra.

936
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,840
Then on My way back, he told Me that he raised him [unclear],

937
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:29,480
hang him on a well before he [unclear].

938
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,800
[unclear] they take you to tests to much, they do this,

939
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:36,840
but there are many people like that.

940
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:38,999
Another one who was here [unclear]

941
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,000
[unclear] Realization and started making money and I didn`t know.

942
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,880
He came back and he told me that he's doing very well.

943
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,880
But the vibrations were very bad and we discovered

944
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,880
that he was making money out of his vibrations.

945
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:54,240
And I scolded him, I said, "Why did you make money like this?"

946
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,880
He said, "Should I become poor man?"

947
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:58,400
I said, "Whatever you were doing, as if you were a teacher...

948
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,160
Why don't you become a teacher?

949
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,840
Why do you want to sell vibrations?

950
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:04,000
Did I give you vibrations for money?"

951
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,360
He said, "No, but I have to do it". He shouted at Me.

952
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,880
But then he went away [unclear].

953
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:11,240
And he went to see him [in Calcutta], this fellow.

954
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,040
And the description is like this,

955
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,800
because he came back and [unclear].

956
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:17,880
He said that, "As soon as I went there he started,

957
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,800
and the guru started throwing big stones at me.

958
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,440
So [unclear] back to the station

959
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,160
and the people from there came and told Me that

960
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,040
"The guru is very angry with you

961
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,360
because you went to Mother and misbehave,

962
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,840
and he`s not going to talk to you.

963
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,160
So he was quite surprised. He said, "All right,

964
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,800
I've never seen this guru, please ask him."

965
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:40,360
Then three times he went there and the guru was beating him,

966
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:43,120
throwing stones at him.

967
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,880
But this fellow, you see, I think human beings have this habit,

968
00:53:46,999 --> 00:53:49,999
the more you try to discard them, the more they'll stick to you.

969
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,640
Otherwise if you're kind to them,

970
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,680
they don't understand kindness perhaps.

971
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,880
Then forth day [unclear]

972
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:01,920
[unclear]

973
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,880
[unclear]

974
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:09,320
[unclear]

975
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,840
But this fellow has been doing such wrong things, even now in a way,

976
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:17,160
that he cannot come and see Me

977
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,840
because he is making money out of Sahaja Yoga.

978
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:21,880
He is calling himself as a Sahaja Yogi

979
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,880
and he is curing people and he is trying to befool them.

980
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:28,280
And surprisingly, he is an Indian but  I can't understand

981
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,720
why he took to such a [gain].

982
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,240
In India we have so many Sahaja Yogis, thousands,

983
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,240
but nobody does like this.

984
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,999
I don`t know why he is doing like this, really.

985
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,920
So this is what it is. There are gurus, many gurus,

986
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,840
but they don`t want to have anything to do with others.

987
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,999
They are very [unclear] people.

988
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,999
I am [trying], yet I am not given up.

989
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:04,999
Q: Would excessive fatigue have an effect of your Self Realization,

990
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,400
or impair your powers of discrimination?

991
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:12,360
Would excessive fatigue

992
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,800
impair your discrimination

993
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:17,240
and have an effect on your Self Realization?

994
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,120
SM: Excessive what? SY: Fatigue, tiredness.

995
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,640
Excessive physical exhaustion.

996
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,120
SM: Excessive fatigue if you have is very simple to get rid of it.

997
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,200
You see what you have to do, when you are having this fatigue,

998
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,800
your right side is exhausted, all right?

999
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,800
When put your left hand towards the photograph,

1000
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,840
because in the beginning you have to use My photograph.

1001
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,120
Later on you need not, but in the beginning.

1002
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,720
Even if My photograph is not there, you can put the hand,

1003
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,999
and raise your left side like this.

1004
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,640
Left. Raise the left side to the right. Like this.

1005
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,160
And put it here. Even for a heart attack it is very important.

1006
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:58,080
Even if you have heart attacks as hearth is [unclear]

1007
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,120
you can raise your left side, raise it up

1008
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,880
take it out from your head and put it down.

1009
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:06,999
The fatigue will go away, you get balanced.

1010
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,200
But one should not go to extremes in Sahaja Yoga.

1011
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,999
You should work to a point then finish off.

1012
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,920
But once the energy is established,

1013
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,999
connection is established [unclear].

1014
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:25,240
We are very resistant, quite a lot. Look at Me.

1015
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,960
Q: I have something that is in away question

1016
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,240
but it's difficult for me to put it in that form

1017
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,120
so I would like just say something that

1018
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,760
that might make it so.

1019
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,480
I was listening with a friend yesterday,

1020
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,920
and listening just some wonderful music,

1021
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,440
and, and I had, I had some moments

1022
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,880
of, of real feeling, of real, and some more realization

1023
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:04,880
and sense of the beauty in the world

1024
00:57:04,999 --> 00:57:06,400
than I have had in the past.

1025
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,920
It seems to be something that has been growing and developing

1026
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,120
with what I hear, what I see,

1027
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,760
as I am still quite a beginner on the spiritual path,

1028
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,200
but I have been on, long enough to feel this.

1029
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,999
And, and I was about to remark to my friend

1030
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:31,999
that such a beautiful world, and yet it seems that the more

1031
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,480
the more that we do in a positive [side] in this world

1032
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,480
it seems, that there seems to be on the, always on the other extreme

1033
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,999
more problems, more, more...

1034
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,999
things that are threatening, threatening us.

1035
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,160
[unclear] and in myself I feel that as I, as I haven't tried

1036
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,800
to develop spirituality, I feel that sometimes

1037
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:08,320
on one hand I have moments of this type of wonders

1038
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,400
and on the other hand more and more feelings of fear.

1039
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,080
So in a way, is like an internal fear that I hope

1040
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,160
that I will survive that exploding

1041
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,800
on, on the, without destroying myself in this path,

1042
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:30,400
and in a larger sense I hope that the world will survive,

1043
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,280
this period of so...SY [unclear]

1044
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:43,280
The basic conflict between what we see as a [unclear]

1045
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,880
consciousness and the beauty of things,

1046
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:49,120
for example the music he was listening to yesterday

1047
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,480
made him closer to [unclear].

1048
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,800
But yet on the outside he sees that struggle, that conflict,

1049
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,999
that fear and [he things what's the] solution

1050
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,680
and how the Realization....

1051
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,999
SM: You see that is what I say

1052
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,600
that unless and until the Realization is established,

1053
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,880
you don't become the master of the situation.

1054
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:12,240
Now wone must know that if you see a conflict or anything

1055
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,880
you don`t know how to master it.

1056
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:15,200
That is the point is.

1057
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,040
But if you somehow get your Realization established,

1058
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,440
then what happens is that you are out of it.

1059
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
Because you are out of it you can handle the situation very well.

1060
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,880
And you are amazed how things work out.

1061
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,920
How things work out and how it helps you.

1062
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,200
So you don`t have to worry. You become just the master.

1063
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,800
Because you are still not the master.

1064
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:37,720
That`s why there is the problem.

1065
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,360
But once you are the master you handle all the situation.

1066
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,160
Then what you do is to give others.

1067
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,320
You become so confident, you give others.

1068
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,200
Now for example now, Dr. Warren went to Australia.

1069
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,999
SM: Now the amount of centers is?
SY: Eight.

1070
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,200
We have eight centers, and at least three to four thousands people

1071
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,999
were realized by him.

1072
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:06,760
So once you become the master, then no, nothing can disturb you.

1073
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,920
You have no fear because you are the master, You know how to handle.

1074
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,120
You are the master of the ship.

1075
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,720
When the ship is seaworthy and the master is an expert,

1076
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,480
he knows how to handle the situation.

1077
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,480
In the same way you become the master.

1078
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,000
That's the point is, you have to become the master.

1079
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,480
Make a choice. all right? The question is [unclear], please.

1080
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,999
Yes, yes, you tell. You are the [winner?].

1081
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,920
P: Teacher, on our spiritual journey, as we are seekers,

1082
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,999
how we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

1083
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,240
SY: On our Spiritual path for Realization

1084
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,640
how do we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

1085
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,080
SM: It's very simple My child, I tell you to find out.

1086
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,880
First thing is that a person who is a true teacher

1087
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:00,120
he never takes any money from you. He has to give you.

1088
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,240
He doesn't take anything. He cannot sell.

1089
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:08,360
Secondly, the life style of that person

1090
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,480
is according to his own balance.

1091
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,999
Supposing I'm a carpenter,

1092
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,999
then I live like a carpenter in complete [unclear].

1093
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,640
If I am [not], supposing I'm a wife of such and such.

1094
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,480
All right, I live with that.

1095
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,160
But I am completely detached about it.

1096
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,440
Thirdly, a person who doesn't give you

1097
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,800
the experience of the Divine,

1098
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,680
is not true.

1099
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,000
Truth is what? Not such mesmerism.

1100
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,480
Now how to understand what is their experience of the Divine.

1101
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,160
Because Divine does things which human being cannot do.

1102
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,960
Like a flower becomes a fruit. All right?

1103
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,200
Now supposing somebody makes you jump, or shout, or scream,

1104
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,999
or makes you say some things going through mantras, this, that.

1105
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,600
Anybody can do, what's so special?

1106
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,999
Any human being can do it. You can always jump,

1107
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,880
you can always shout, you can do all kinds of things.

1108
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:04,720
Somebody mesmerizes you, it's very simple.

1109
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:09,440
But if you get a cool breeze coming out of your head,

1110
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,480
and through your fingers, this cannot be done.

1111
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
This is divine.

1112
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,200
Anybody who does that, is a great teacher.

1113
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,480
Otherwise you become the teacher,

1114
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,840
now why you want a teacher to be followed?

1115
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:23,999
You become the teacher. That is why is Mother's job.

1116
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,880
Mother is the best teacher I think because she is born teacher.

1117
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:36,920
She has to be. And the teacher who loves, who is compassion,

1118
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,920
Is very difficult these days. I wish there were some [unclear]

1119
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,880
But they are so [unclear], so difficult.

1120
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:50,880
Anyone of them takes My responsibility, I would be really happy,

1121
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:54,999
because to travel all over the world, like this, is too much for Me.

1122
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,240
But I couldn't find anybody who will give you

1123
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,880
that love and affection.

1124
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:02,240
They get so annoyed and so easily disturbed.

1125
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,880
that they want to go back to their places,

1126
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:07,400
they don't want to face you, what to do?

1127
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,720
I wish you people become experts

1128
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,999
and do the job for Me. You will do it.

1129
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,999
SM: All right?
SY: Yes.

1130
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,120
What's the vibration, always speak [unclear] and feeling vibrations

1131
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,720
but I don't have sensation of cold.

1132
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,120
SY: Good evening.
P: I [can] get vibrations.

1133
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,960
SY: What, what [unclear]?

1134
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,440
SM: Are you feeling the cool breeze?

1135
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,400
No, that's the point. She said she feels

1136
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,760
that she is [frightened] of vibrations, but is not always cool.

1137
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,999
No, no, cool, it should be cool. It should be cool.

1138
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,840
If it is only vibrations then it's not all right.

1139
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,160
That means the cool breeze is trying to come in

1140
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,640
but there is still an obstruction. All right?

1141
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,600
It's all right. There is nothing wrong, it is all [working].

1142
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,800
It will not take much time. It's all right, doesn't matter.

1143
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:54,000
Just started [unclear], the feeling has started.

1144
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,840
But if it is the cool breeze coming in the hands

1145
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:03,080
and the cool, not very cool, but cooler type, then it is correct.

1146
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,280
I have two simple questions.

1147
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,999
The first is how to evolve [in collectivity as human race]

1148
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,440
from man to superman. Some people think this was suggested

1149
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,280
[unclear] India and Europe, that we have done so far.

1150
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,920
One at a time, yes. What is the first question? Let him.

1151
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,880
Maybe he wants to connect it with [You].

1152
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:38,280
And is Shri Mataji, the only manifestation of the Adi Shakti

1153
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,240
in a human body, [in these days].

1154
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:46,480
Man to superman.

1155
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,160
How we evolve, how we are evolving at this stage

1156
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,160
from man to superman?

1157
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,880
And is Shri Mataji,

1158
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,760
the only one who is Adi Shakti in a human body

1159
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,680
on the Earth today?

1160
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:08,240
SM: One answer is...
SY: Sorry ,in this century.

1161
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,440
You better ask the question. And get the vibrations as an answer.

1162
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,600
[unclear], "Mother are You an Incarnation?"

1163
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,840
Ask the question, "Mother are You the Adi Shakti?"

1164
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:19,760
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

1165
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,400
SM: Ask three times.

1166
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,360
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?
SY: Again.

1167
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,160
Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

1168
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,960
SY: Are you feeling the cool vibrations on your hands?

1169
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,400
P: Yes.
SY: That's your answer.

1170
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,840
SM: That's the answer. You are comfortable.

1171
01:05:32,999 --> 01:05:36,440
SY: You can ask any question. It will give you cool vibrations.

1172
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,400
SM: And definitely human beings are, have to evolve.

1173
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,920
They cannot [unclear] unless and until they get their Realization.

1174
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,480
This is the way you can find out whether [unclear].

1175
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,960
All absolute questions can be answered.

1176
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,080
SY: Same, people can ask, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

1177
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,999
[unclear]

1178
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,320
SY: Put your hands [unclear].

1179
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,720
I think the best you put right [unclear] on the left hand side.

1180
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,320
SY: Close your eyes.
SM: Right hand.

1181
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,320
Right hand up [unclear].

1182
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,480
SY: Left towards Shri Mataji, right hand up in the air like this.

1183
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,160
No, like this [unclear].

1184
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,920
Ask it, in your heart.

1185
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,760
SM: All right?
SY: Ask it three times.

1186
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,999
Yes, it's working out [unclear].

1187
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,320
Put the hand at the back side, like this.

1188
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,720
facing like this, not [unclear].

1189
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,400
He looks so [unclear]. I could not understand. How are you?

1190
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,999
Feeling all right?

1191
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,640
What a simple thing has worked out, yes?

1192
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,160
You should come and see Me again to see about it.

1193
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,320
[unclear]

1194
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,480
SM: You are coming to the second?
SY: Yes, yes.

1195
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,720
We are having a seminar, at the weekend.

1196
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,680
about eighty miles from here. Very nice place.

1197
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,480
And i don't know, whatever it is.

1198
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,120
And those who want to come,

1199
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,960
should give their addresses to Dr. Warren.

1200
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,760
And today is the last day.

1201
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,960
And I'm afraid I have to say good bye to you.

1202
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,999
I hope I'll try to come next year,

1203
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,080
but I can't say that I'll be here.

1204
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,999
But in any case, let's try to get Realization.

1205
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,200
So we put our hands again, like this, and sit comfortable.

1206
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,800
SY: [You take your shoes out].

1207
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,480
Today I think all of you have [unclear] on the heart,

1208
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,960
[little while].

1209
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,440
On the heart, more on the heart.

1210
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,320
Put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on the heart.

1211
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,040
And close your eyes,

1212
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,120
putting both the feet on the ground, separately.

1213
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,680
Separated from each other. Just put them on the ground.

1214
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,640
Now put your hand on your heart, and just close your eyes.

1215
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,800
Just close your eyes.

1216
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:51,360
Close your eyes. Heart.

1217
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,000
Now, today, as it is the last day,

1218
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,400
let's jut be [receptive] about it.

1219
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,999
And you have to say,

1220
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:11,720
in your heart, with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1221
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,400
Say it twelve times.

1222
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,880
You can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, most of you.

1223
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,999
It's working very fast today. Let's see if it is there.

1224
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,440
Put your left hand towards Me.

1225
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,400
You can feel it first, and then with the right hand.

1226
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,080
See if the cool breeze is coming.

1227
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:35,600
All right? It's there. Most of you [have got].

1228
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,600
I'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini.

1229
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,680
Today it has worked much faster.

1230
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,999
But those who have not felt the cool breeze we'll see them [after].

1231
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,840
First of all, put your left hand in front of your Kundalini.

1232
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:50,280
Don't get upset if you have not felt. You'll feel.

1233
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,200
Because [unclear].

1234
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,999
Now left hand in front of your Kundalini,

1235
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,999
and right hand has to be moved

1236
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,080
here, front, below, front.

1237
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,720
Like that. We have to raise it now, ourselves.

1238
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,999
Watch your hand.

1239
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,320
Now, make your shoulders loose, and push back your head,

1240
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,800
and give them twist, and now a knot.

1241
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,400
We have to do it three times.

1242
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,999
Watch your hand with concentration, left hand.

1243
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,999
Now loosen and put the twist.

1244
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:36,999
And with a knot.

1245
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,000
Third time, 3 knots [have to do].

1246
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:56,120
One, two and three.

1247
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,240
Now see if you are feeling it.

1248
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,160
All right? You can put up your hands, in the air.

1249
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,280
And now put up your head,

1250
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,280
and say, "Mother, is this the Holy Ghost?"

1251
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,200
or we can say, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1252
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,999
Is this the chaitanya lahari of the Adi Shakti?

1253
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:32,999
Ask the question thrice.

1254
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,080
[All you feel it?]

1255
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,200
Now let's see if you have cool breeze in the hand.

1256
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,120
All right? Got it?

1257
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,240
Those who are not feeling it?

1258
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:47,840
All right, you see Me. Let's see them. They are not feeling it.

1259
01:13:47,999 --> 01:13:51,400
One or two. The Sahaja Yogis will come and see you, all right?

1260
01:13:51,999 --> 01:13:55,200
[But you get it out, you get it all right,] there's no problem.

1261
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,880
Must be some problem there. Who is the gentleman there?

1262
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:00,960
There's one gentleman there. Can you see [unclear]?

1263
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,920
Dan, are you there?

1264
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,280
SM: This gentleman there.
SY: [unclear]
