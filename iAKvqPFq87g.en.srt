1
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,780
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,780
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is. You cannot change it;

3
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,960
you cannot transform it; you cannot conceptualize
it. It is what it is; it was what it was and

4
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,730
it will be what it will be.

5
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,730
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

6
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,660
scientist. You need not believe into what
I say. We have had enough of problems with

7
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,660
blind faith. But keep your minds open in case
this proves; then you have to believe, believe

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,500
in it. If you are honest people, you have
to believe in it. Because it is for the benevolence

9
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,220
of your individual self, for the benevolence
of your city, your country and world at large.

10
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:18,019
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit. There

11
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:26,230
something wrong somewhere that we create problems.
And these problems come to human beings when

12
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,370
there is a problem with these centres here
as explained to you.

13
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,930
Now these centres do exist. These are energy
centres within you. And when they are, (Mother

14
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,930
speaks aside, Thank you, (Lawrence?) thank
you, its cold, I don’t like, I like, just

15
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:01,459
ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem

16
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,100
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

17
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:19,100
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

18
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,800
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil. It’s a mathematical thing.

19
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,800
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

20
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,320
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood. (Mother speaks aside,

21
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:05,720
Thank you very much, (referring to glass of
water) thank you)

22
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

23
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:23,949
you are not these conditionings. What we say,
“This is my house, this is my car, this

24
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:33,330
is my wife, this is my husband, my children”
but who is this ‘my’ which owns it? So

25
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,840
that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

26
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,630
you.

27
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:55,630
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

28
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,820
all the living work. Now you see beautiful
flowers all over since I’ve come to Australia.

29
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,820
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers. Who does this miracle? They’re

30
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,060
different, of a different shape, different
colour. “Who” does that? Who runs our

31
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:30,060
heart, we never ask this question to ourselves.
We take all living work for granted. We never

32
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,210
bother to find out who does that.

33
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,940
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

34
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,940
“Why are we on this Earth? What is our purpose
of coming to this Earth, to be born as human

35
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,910
beings, to be evolved as human beings, what
is the purpose?”

36
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,910
Is it just to insure our self and die? Is
that? What is the purpose of life? What is

37
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,440
our identity? And when we start asking these
questions, we find that nobody has been able

38
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:23,260
to answer this question.

39
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:35,310
Science cannot answer this question. Science
has its own limitations. So this all-pervading

40
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:44,650
power, which does all the living work, we
have never felt it. We have read it in Scriptures

41
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,500
that there is all-pervading power of God’s
love, there’s the ‘Ruh’, is there. They

42
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,080
call it Paramchaitanya or also they say it
is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

43
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,830
But where is that? Nobody has felt it, nobody
has known about it.

44
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:08,830
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

45
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:18,370
everywhere. Like a big tree but what about
the roots? If you do not find the roots, the

46
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:28,130
result is as you have now recession; this
problem, that problem. So where are the roots?

47
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,190
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

48
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,190
or from East, what’s the harm. Because it
is important that we should know our roots.

49
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,500
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

50
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,380
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

51
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:05,380
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing. What we know; about outside. But

52
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:14,490
we don’t know what’s wrong with us; where
do we go wrong?

53
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,910
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

54
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,320
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

55
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,320
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it? For which you don’t

56
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:46,260
have to pay. You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary
process. It’s a living process! For example,

57
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,860
how much do we pay for these flowers to Mother
Earth? Who’s done the job? It’s built-in

58
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:04,300
in a seed, to germinate and built-in in the
Mother Land that it will germinate. We don’t

59
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,920
pay for that. It’s already built-in there.
In the same way if it is built-in within you,

60
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,920
you can’t pay for it. One thing, if you
realize that you can’t pay for your evolutionary

61
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,400
process, for anything that is Divinity, for
anything that is pure; half of the problems

62
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,820
will be solved of this guru shopping that
you have been doing all these days. Because

63
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,820
if you are not going to pay for it, and these
people are asking for money, that means something

64
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,000
wrong with them! You cannot market it!

65
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

66
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:06,050
take place. And that has become very, very
easy in modern times.

67
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,550
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

68
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,820
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection. Even in Indian scriptures

69
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,820
they have described about these special times
when people who will get so much disillusioned

70
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,270
in the illusion, they will be born and they
will be disillusioned that they take to reality,

71
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:42,230
and this thing will happen. It’s already
predicted and this is the time, such a fortunate

72
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:49,230
time when we are all born. And it has to work
out. It is your own power. It’s your own

73
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Mother, it’s your individual Mother, and
She knows everything about you. It’s all

74
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,890
tape-recorded. And She is anxious to give
you this Second Birth. She is anxious. And

75
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,330
She does it very beautifully. I’ve read
some books which says that Kundalini Awakening

76
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,670
is very dangerous and all that. I can’t
understand! It has never happened before like

77
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,680
that. I’ve been working like this for the
last, I think, I don’t know how many years

78
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,680
now; at least twenty-five years and I’ve
never seen anybody being harmed. On the contrary,

79
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,460
everybody’s helped; physically, mentally,
emotionally.

80
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:41,460
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

81
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,339
subjects. Now there’s a fourth doctor who
is trying on blood cancer and all that.

82
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,980
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

83
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,750
nervous system”. But who is this “auto”,
who is this “auto” that does this work?

84
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,839
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

85
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,839
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

86
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,279
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

87
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:32,279
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

88
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,700
but in Russia I was surprised. There are two
hundred doctors who are practicing Sahaja

89
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,360
Yoga in Russia.

90
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,190
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much. About

91
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:54,190
30% of them are funny type. They’ll ask
for Marlboro cigarettes but 70% are so sensitive

92
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,020
to Sahaja Yoga. I was amazed the way they
took to me and threw away all absurd gurus

93
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:08,020
from them. Not one person could prosper. And
no religion is allowed to be practiced there

94
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,130
where they have now started taking to Sahaja
Yoga.

95
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:19,130
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

96
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,520
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

97
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,910
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised. In thousands

98
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:38,510
and thousands of people, so sensitive, so
open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

99
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,510
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me. Started telling them about

100
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,589
I…I thought, better start from science.
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell

101
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,589
us science; we know everything about science.
No we don’t, You tell us the science of

102
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:55,839
God.”

103
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,810
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

104
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,220
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper. I read the same

105
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,060
thing: “so-called democracy”. Because
it looks sometimes like a demonocracy you

106
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:25,060
see, like you go to America; you can’t even
wear your wedding ring. They might take away

107
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,709
your wedding ring also and kill you for that.
That’s supposed to be democracy!

108
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,670
You have to be extremely careful. I was surprised
in Perth. We were going in the night for about

109
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,750
thirty-five kilometres. No gangsterism on
the way, I was surprised. How this country

110
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,390
is still saved.

111
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,820
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

112
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,370
power can take you to anything.

113
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:04,170
Same with religions. You take any religion,
whether you are Hindu, Christian, Muslim,

114
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,720
anything. One can commit any sin. What’s
the use of denouncing others; everybody does

115
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,390
the same I thing; no difference. All are only
convinced they are something excellent but

116
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:24,390
they are not, in no way!

117
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,190
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

118
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,690
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

119
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,690
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’. These are special category of

120
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:53,010
people, as described by so many poets. And
when it works out, they are the ones who jump

121
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,860
into themselves. Jump into this beautiful
era, of what we call the New Age. It’s a

122
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,860
happening. It’s not just branding yourself
New Age; somebody calls themselves by some

123
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:24,419
other name, it’s not that. It’s another
Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding. But something

124
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,289
that has to happen and that happening is awakening
of the kundalini.

125
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,289
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God. And they

126
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,580
will become divine and they will have powers
to make others divine, exactly that is Sahaja

127
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,610
Yoga.

128
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,610
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed. For

129
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:07,799
example, some people go to Himalayas, stand
on their heads. Or they starve themselves,

130
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,799
fast, do all kinds of things. And they find
nothing. They can’t understand how it happens.

131
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,799
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

132
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,840
ourselves.

133
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,840
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

134
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,190
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion. So you also become very

135
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,039
dynamic. I know poor people becoming very
rich suddenly.

136
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,909
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

137
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:54,909
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

138
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,940
two children. He was in an accident and whole
his brain as if came out; a terrible condition.

139
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,940
And doctors gave it up that he will die. Not
that he was saved, but he is absolutely normal

140
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:18,739
now. I was in tears to see him so beautifully
cured.

141
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:26,289
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

142
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:38,669
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.
This power starts flowing through you. You

143
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:50,549
become a vehicle of that power. And once you
learn how to make others the same way, how

144
00:19:53,889 --> 00:20:00,889
to raise their kundalini, you can create thousands
of people who are self-realized.

145
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:07,929
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

146
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:16,239
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents. So maybe

147
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,749
they are taking to you people who are kind
to children and your government is also very

148
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:23,830
kind to them.

149
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,830
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

150
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,830
And they are very moral. So all the problems
that we have created out of our ideas of sort

151
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,879
of modernism or any kind of thing. And that
we see that our children are going to dogs

152
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,359
is all stopped through this awakening.

153
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:01,359
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

154
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:10,269
to me. If, supposing I’m carrying a snake
in my hand and there’s darkness all over,

155
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,440
I can’t see anything and somebody says,
“you have a snake in your hand”, I’ll

156
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,899
never give up if I’m very obstinate, I will
never give up. I’ll say, “No, it’s just

157
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:25,899
a rope.” But when there’s little light
I will myself give it up. In the same way

158
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,980
it happens; it works this way that you yourself
become powerful. Throw away all that is destructive,

159
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:41,019
all that is to be given up.

160
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,389
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

161
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:52,389
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born. The innate religion, which keeps

162
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:59,210
you religious, righteous, compassionate and
dynamic. You don’t have to change your dress,

163
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,429
you don’t have to change your lifestyle,
you don’t have to give up your wives and

164
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:10,429
children, but you get it just where you are.
It’s so simple, made so simple. I would

165
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:18,259
say, if you are hungry, you can have it. Like,
if I’ve done the cooking, and if you are

166
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,379
hungry and you will say otherwise “mother
just lets have the food.” But if you are

167
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:31,379
not, then you will go on discussing, arguing,
this, that. These are all mental feats. I

168
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,519
mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

169
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,519
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

170
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,720
feat. It doesn’t give you realization. You
are here for your realization, by which you

171
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,720
are helped so much that physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually you become all

172
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,809
right.

173
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:04,809
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.
The peace within you, you achieve. How? You

174
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,749
live with your thoughts. The thoughts rise,
fall, rise, fall and in between these thoughts,

175
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:21,749
there’s a little space. Mostly, you are
thinking about the future or the past. You

176
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,080
cannot be in the present. In the present,
there is no thought. You are with reality.

177
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,509
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

178
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:43,509
present is established. When that space is
established, you become peaceful, absolutely

179
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:48,029
peaceful within yourself.

180
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:55,029
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

181
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,759
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

182
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,549
I mean you cannot go near them. It is horribly
hot-tempered people, and they have got peace

183
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:17,600
awards I don’t know how. No peace within.
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

184
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,600
No patience, nothing. And then I realize that
it’s so outside; the whole thing is. They

185
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:35,379
don’t understand if you don’t have peace
within, how can have a Peace Award? Well you

186
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:38,919
can. That is our life.

187
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,259
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

188
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,229
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

189
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:57,229
Just in peace. But you are aware; you are
not fainted down or you are not in some sort

190
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:09,009
of a trance. You are absolutely aware and
very much more aware because, you are in Reality.

191
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,259
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

192
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:24,259
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. Sometimes you
feel it hot, also. On these fingertips are

193
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,599
your sympathetic centres. And these Sympathetic
Centres are from left and right. They join

194
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,779
together to make the Parasympathetic.

195
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:46,779
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

196
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,940
indicates on our right and left side.

197
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,940
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental. I mean English

198
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:03,749
Language, “mental” means something different,
but I mean whatever we do with our brain.

199
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:10,629
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

200
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:17,629
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time

201
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,849
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will
give witness against you; means they will

202
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,190
tell you what’s wrong with you.

203
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,379
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others. Now somehow if you know

204
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:41,379
how to correct these centres, you’re all
right, and correct the centres of others you

205
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:48,389
can also make them all right. It’s so simple,
it’s all within you, all the mechanism is

206
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:55,200
within you. It’s all there. Only thing you
have to understand the importance of it. Without

207
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,419
that you can never be happy.

208
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:04,419
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire. All other desires are not pure.

209
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,690
Today we want to have say; some flowers. Tomorrow
we want to have a house; the day after tomorrow

210
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:18,690
we want to have helicopter. I don’t know;
we go on and on. So every desire, which is

211
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,119
fulfilled, is never satisfied! Once we get
it, it’s finished. Then again of course,

212
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,749
it’s a law of economics also, that in general,
wants are not satiable. It’s a fact.

213
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:35,539
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you. Whether you are aware of it

214
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:42,539
or not, is the desire to be one with this
all-pervading power. And all the powers that

215
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:50,159
you have within you start manifesting. You
have no idea at all what powers you have.

216
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:56,759
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

217
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,659
never seen electricity. And if you tell them
that in this box you can see some films, they’ll

218
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:07,309
say, “What, this is just a box! What are
you telling us stories?”

219
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:13,559
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box. But do you know what powers you

220
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:20,070
have within yourself? What you can do for
this world? What can you do for yourself,

221
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,070
to your family, to your children? How you
can really be a great force of reforms and

222
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,109
transformation without troubling anybody?

223
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:40,109
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth. You know them on your fingertips. If

224
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:46,759
a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

225
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:53,759
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

226
00:28:55,349 --> 00:29:02,349
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru. Earn a lot of money. How will you know

227
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:09,469
if this fellow has been to jail, or is he
a real person or not?

228
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:18,090
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth. A new dimension in you, that

229
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,440
on your fingertips you know not only your
centres, but the centres of others. Everybody

230
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:35,749
feels the same way, knows the same way. Then
where is the quarrel, where is the argument,

231
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,509
where is the war?

232
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:44,489
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

233
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:48,509
now practised in sixty nations. I’ve never
seen them quarrelling, fighting, of course

234
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:55,509
they pull each other’s leg and have a little
humor about it, but never have I seen fighting,

235
00:29:56,239 --> 00:30:00,080
never! No question, no question of argument.

236
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,529
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

237
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:11,559
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

238
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,559
communism is good. How? How do you know that?
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and

239
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:25,719
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas
and you’re all fighting with each other.

240
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:28,529
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

241
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:35,529
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible. You can diagnose people. One

242
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:43,950
fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only. But I

243
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,609
said, “You don’t have to do anything in
Sahaja Yoga like that. You can diagnose about

244
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:56,629
yourself, you can diagnose about others. There’s
no need to go through all that.

245
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:02,629
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting. And you must have

246
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:09,629
the full knowledge about it. It should not
be half way. Your attention becomes extremely

247
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:19,179
innocent and powerful. The attention, when
it is diverted everywhere; you see you get

248
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,059
confused and people get schizophrenia, this,
that; all that.

249
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:31,059
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

250
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:40,289
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

251
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,719
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

252
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:52,580
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know. You can know about the people

253
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:59,580
who are dead, or the people who are very far
away. You can find out sitting down. This

254
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,320
is what we can call as “collective consciousness”.
A new dimension of consciousness comes to

255
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,289
you about which Jung has written, collective
consciousness. So you develop this collective

256
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:23,059
consciousness within yourself. For that you
don’t need any education, you don’t need

257
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,710
anything. Even villagers can do it. Even small
little children can do it, because they know

258
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,719
this power. As all of us have the power to
see something, as you all can see me sitting

259
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:39,719
down here, in the same way you can know about
others; know about yourself; without doing

260
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:49,219
any acrobats. So simple as that, all these
powers are your.

261
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:57,249
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading

262
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,769
power of God. We say we leave it to God, all
right, leave it to God. But you are not connected.

263
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:13,219
When we pray also we are not connected. You
know a telephone, which is not connected,

264
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:20,119
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but
you are not connected. After realization,

265
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:26,830
even to, just a problem comes to you and it
gets solved, because you get out of your problem

266
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,259
and you can see it clearly and the Divine
helps you.

267
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:37,259
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

268
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:42,210
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

269
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,399
what to do.

270
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:50,399
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

271
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:58,779
He looks after you. It’s not just a talk
or a sermon, but it’s a happening and the

272
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:04,679
happening has to take place; otherwise our
attention, which is outside, will not be taken

273
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,339
inside.

274
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:12,339
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves. And it works.

275
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,760
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.
Otherwise you would not be here. And it is

276
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,480
your right to get this realization. Sahaja
means “born”: ‘sah’ is with you; ‘jah’

277
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,470
is “born”. “With you” is “born”.
This right to get to this yoga, means the

278
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:39,149
union with the Divine. And is your right and
you should assert and all those who will ask

279
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:44,599
for it have to have it. It is their right.
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary

280
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:51,599
process. And now, the last bit has to happen
and it will work out.

281
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:58,270
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening. It’s a collective

282
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,270
happening. It works better when there are
many people. Also when you have to know about

283
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:09,619
it, learn about it, take advantage of it,
you have to come to the collective.

284
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:15,060
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

285
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:21,940
that they start marketing it. You cannot market
it. For definite, you cannot market it. It

286
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,940
is divine love. And love you can never market.
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can

287
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,230
you market it?

288
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,390
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

289
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:45,390
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

290
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:53,030
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

291
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:59,540
Sahaja Yoga. It’s not difficult at all.
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s

292
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,340
not to stand on your head or anything. Just
wherever you are, you’ll get it. It’s

293
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:11,340
so simple. Because the time has come. And
you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

294
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:19,140
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone. So I would request

295
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,590
you to pay attention to it. And once you get
your realization, you should really come to

296
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:32,920
the collective because it would be like what
Christ has described as sprouted, seeds which

297
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,920
were thrown somewhere and were lost, so you
have to grow, and that growth is important.

298
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,640
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

299
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,680
you should try to keep to it and understand.
It’s as simple as that.

300
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,680
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy. That is, when your ego is pampered

301
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:07,340
you feel happy and when the ego is punctured,
you feel unhappy. It is joy, has no duality.

302
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:14,340
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama. And you lose your

303
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,000
age very much. You feel very dynamic; at the
same time very compassionate.

304
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,870
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

305
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,350
day. And it’s all right. People said “Mother,
don’t you feel you are traveling too much?”

306
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,700
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere. Where am I traveling?”

307
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:42,700
In the same way, it happens to you. And the
ageing and all that never comes into your

308
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:51,770
mind. You just live; live in the present.
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company

309
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,270
of all other realized souls. All over the
world you have relations. Wherever you go

310
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:03,360
they’ll be all there to help you, to look
after you. Something happens to one person,

311
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:09,910
all over the world they will try to help,
the doctors will run to that place, people

312
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,980
will pray, and I mean they will see to it
that the person is saved.

313
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,980
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

314
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,640
May God bless you!

315
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom. You

316
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,900
are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

317
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,380
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.
As you have to accept it that you want to

318
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:07,230
have it. I would request people who don’t
want to have it, they should leave the hall

319
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:13,450
and leave others, but those who want to have
it are very welcome, and they can have it.

320
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,220
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

321
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:26,220
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

322
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,470
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it. On the contrary it doesn’t help

323
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:39,470
others also to have such people among you
who don’t want to have it. It will take

324
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,980
hardly ten minutes and I would request you
not to disturb others when we are in the process

325
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:04,190
of it. Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

326
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:10,760
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

327
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,760
and will show you how we 

328
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:35,190
do it.

329
