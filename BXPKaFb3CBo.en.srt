Halloween mother Halloween is an

7
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,640
abbreviation of the term Hallows Eve

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,640
because

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:50,460
suspended indefinitely some new zombie

10
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,259
is refuted to be all famous a mother the

11
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,270
day of all the same that's what we

12
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,869
didn't email all things they pursue any

13
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:08,190
did anything we have it on Sunday all

14
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:10,810
right Billy 43 it's very important

15
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:18,460
because that is the day

16
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:23,440
the goddess as a power as a power

17
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:29,920
because it was kartikeya he did not pass

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:35,490
whatever and he was one of the worst of

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:39,220
all did not be killed so she WA and

20
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,940
Parvati were married for the special

21
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,010
purpose to produce this fault rule

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:50,170
shucks people trapped in the front of

23
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:54,480
the shop owners car together and he was

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:59,640
just called to kill this horrible them

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,250
fathers not possible and he kicked that

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,250
is the day between three it's something

27
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,730
like valuation that way because that is

28
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:14,940
the day they open the gates of hand and

29
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,890
put all these Devils in to help and

30
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:25,959
that's why that the one has to rest in

31
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:30,610
the body tonight because some of them

32
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:35,080
might be hanging around better

33
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:39,640
all of it I mean either then that you

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,290
are you do not feel much stirring but if

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,310
you ran in the realm of subconscious

36
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,799
area of collective subconscious you can

37
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,750
see even some of the spirits and also

38
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,739
can feel their existence we see the

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,739
blacks who are Sonora

40
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:03,370
so that day is very dangerous but

41
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:07,360
because Nana Karim escaped people

42
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:11,950
celebrated that celebration it expects

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,430
next year next day which that day is the

44
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,530
day of Diwali to say it is America which

45
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,400
needs sahaja yoga much more than any

46
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:25,550
other country my concern for America is

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,490
for the same reason I am NOT saying so

48
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,460
much about South America but more about

49
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,580
the North America but even in South

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:45,740
America what I found is that it is a

51
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:50,530
kind of a nation where they have no

52
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,930
guidance at all about them no guidance

53
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,170
openly that bring Carnaval these that I

54
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:01,100
mean how can you do it in a country all

55
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:04,400
those things they are following the

56
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,780
footsteps of North America like in North

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,090
America they have this Halloween

58
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,480
nonsense I mean imagine openly on the

59
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,000
street doing Halloween nonsense so they

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,790
are following carnival to them uh what a

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,580
thing it is to go to Rio as if there's a

62
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,950
very big achievement and going into that

63
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:28,100
carnival from all over the places from

64
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:30,710
Australia people are coming down but the

65
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:39,560
worst and the worst and the worst is the

66
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:44,169
Hollywood is the film industry under the

67
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,169
name of industry you can do anything now

68
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:53,690
this Hollywood is creating such horrible

69
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,620
films but the worst is that they get

70
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,230
awards for these worst films this one

71
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,860
film they sure I have not seen I can't

72
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,529
see it they told me that a man is a

73
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,409
cannibal

74
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:13,949
he's eating the flesh of human beings

75
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:16,979
and their soul and they enjoy very very

76
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,839
famous apart from that not only famous

77
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:23,759
but they got awards for the best film

78
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,369
the best actor the best you must get a

79
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,969
director from there and make him eat the

80
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:31,619
flesh of human things it's the only way

81
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,659
I think this horn with you

82
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:36,139
then they are producing other pictures

83
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:39,569
have seen another one for a short time

84
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:46,349
where they shows all dead bodies hanging

85
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:50,519
is it horrible why these people like to

86
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:54,509
see such horrible things what is their

87
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:58,379
character where have they gone why do

88
00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:03,860
they enjoy things which no human being

89
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:03,860
who is a human being with Angela and

90
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:11,459
then it goes further there hollowing

91
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:14,729
business I saw a film castle my god this

92
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:19,649
is a hell in which they thought it was

93
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:21,360
like the wrath of Shri Krishna so it was

94
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:25,379
Krishna consciousness I think that was

95
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,409
working there there are thousand and one

96
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:33,619
things which can shop you in America and

97
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,619
also in England also in Europe

98
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:55,860
