1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,600
I am happy that you all have adjusted yourselves

2
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,560
in this small space.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,540
When there is love and understanding,

4
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,960
little space can occupy many hearts.

5
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:55,200
But when there is no large heart

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,892
then whatever one may get this is never sufficient.

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,520
Today, we are going to worship Shiva Tattwa within us,

8
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,320
principle of Shiva.

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,142
For all Sahaja Yogis it's very important,

10
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,960
because Shiva is the ultimate we have to achieve.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,680
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

12
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:30,237
so to become Shiva

13
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,569
is the ultimate aim of every [creation].

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,160
The rest of it is all created,

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,897
like Vishnu Tattva

16
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:49,439
and Brahmadeva,

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,360
just to create human beings, to evolve them

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,860
and then ultimately lead them to Shiva.

19
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,805
That's the ultimate.

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,771
But human beings get so involved

21
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:16,759
into the Brahmadeva's Tattwas

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,586
that even to get into Vishnu Tattva is difficult.

23
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:28,440
They get involved into the five elements which have created us.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,200
That is the outermost being within us.

25
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,876
All the chakras have the outermost,

26
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:41,077
we can say the, just the vessel,

27
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:47,862
but the desire to be the Spirit

28
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:55,136
is of primer importance in Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:03,305
So we have to see inward towards ourselves as Sahaja Yogis,

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,440
"Do we have that desire entirely,

31
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,524
or we have still many desires hanging around?

32
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:23,080
See the greatest problem is of the Nabhi chakra,

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,632
whether it is in the East or the West.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,330
Some people still have hankering

35
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:36,359
for the baser search of food,

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,363
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja Yoga,

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
of Nabhi chakra.

38
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,499
Then, still some people have

39
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:52,111
sense of possessions and money quite a lot.

40
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:54,560
And subtler and subtler they grow,

41
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,238
still the detachment doesn't develop within them.

42
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,520
It becomes subtler. As you grow subtler,

43
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,890
the attachment becomes subtler and difficult to get out.

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,280
Specially people who come up as leaders in Sahaja Yoga,

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,480
or closer to Sahaja Yoga,

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,640
are always under attack.

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,600
They are attacked

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,160
maybe by their husbands, wives,

49
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,840
brothers, sisters, sons, children, something like that.

50
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,726
And that makes it worse

51
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,840
because all such leaders who are attacked

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,283
try to displease all the deities

53
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,600
by small things here and there.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,720
The whole behaviour has to be understood

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,960
that you have become a subtler person

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,120
and you are rising higher,

57
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,320
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,760
Always the front line is under attack,

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
not the back line.

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,200
So those who are in the front are always under attack

61
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
and they have to be very careful

62
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,160
as to how they are behaving.

63
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
For if there is a sly person,

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,120
he will become sly, but subtler sly.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,040
He will not just become the other way round.

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,360
His slyness will become subtler.

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,412
If he is a miserly fellow,

68
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:50,070
then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

69
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,895
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

70
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,120
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,080
But to get rid of these things within you,

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,524
you have to go to the other side of it.

73
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,966
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous;

74
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,280
give up everything that you have.

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't be calculated,

76
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,987
don't talk of money, don't worry about money.

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,560
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,440
you should go the other way round.

79
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,960
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,

80
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,600
you cannot get rid of these things.

81
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,137
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered,

82
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,979
then become so mild

83
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,320
that even if somebody beats you, it's all right.

84
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
Whatever one says it's all right.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
That's how you get rid of your habits

86
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,520
which become subtler and subtler.

87
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,479
There's another way of dealing with it,

88
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,300
being alert.

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,760
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,360
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

91
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
and then you start understanding why you are behaving,

92
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,489
"Oh, I understand, I knew you before,

93
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,040
ten years back, before my Realization.

94
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
I know Mr., you are like this".

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,080
And then take the juxtaposition against that personality

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,120
and just shoot it off.

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,840
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person,

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,655
whatever you may do for that person,

99
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,353
he will become subtler and subtler.

100
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,640
Suddenly, if it's a girl,

101
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,720
she will start just crying for nothing at all and feeling miserable.

102
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,520
If it's a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,115
he will become analyzer of Sahaja Yoga also,

104
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,319
in a subtler way.

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,080
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,670
and see the reflection, "That's the other one who died".

107
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:57,120
And just try to make fun of that

108
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,007
or shout at it, depends on.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,400
If it is an aggressive stuff,

110
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
it's better to make fun, because it's stupid.

111
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,080
And if it is that one that takes aggression, then shout at it,

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,700
"What do you mean, by taking aggression like that?"

113
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:22,068
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

114
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,600
Your being has to be cleansed.

115
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,768
With your help only I can do it.

116
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,840
Many people say, "Mother, You are all powerful."

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,520
All right, I am and I can do everything.

118
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,120
But only thing I cannot surpass your freedom. That's a fact.

119
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:44,840
I cannot cross over your freedom.

120
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,062
And when I cannot cross your freedom, you have to cross that.

121
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,880
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,825
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.

123
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,039
But if you want to stand outside

124
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,546
I am not the one to put you in with a pistol.

125
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:08,480
No, that's not the way it will work out.

126
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,196
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must know

127
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:17,283
that at every moment you are free, and freer, and freest.

128
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,880
The more free you become, the worse is your situation,

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
as far as the facing of the negativity is concerned.

130
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,160
Say if there are four persons are around you,

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,960
they will be first attacked.

132
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,733
Naturally you can understand

133
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,039
the front line is always under attack,

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
not the back side.

135
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Though according to the law, it should be the back side

136
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,357
because all these horrible, negative forces

137
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,199
should come from the back.

138
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,846
But they are very clever.

139
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,280
They know that the back sometimes drop off by themselves,

140
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,040
so no need to go that side.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,000
They try the front line.

142
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,560
And those who think they are in charge and responsible

143
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
have to be very careful as to how they behave,

144
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,880
how they are responsible, how they work it out,

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,276
if they are keeping their old habits at a subtler level

146
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,240
or they are just fighting it out.

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,185
It's very important.

148
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:21,196
And this is how intelligently you can manage yourselves, very well.

149
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,240
Then once you become detached,

150
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
go from all these things, only at mental level.

151
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
The spiritual level I'll look after.

152
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
But at mental level, you must come to logical conclusion

153
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,320
that, "I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,115
I have to be alert about this nonsense that exists within me."

155
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:59,720
Shiva Tattva is innocent, absolutely innocent it is.

156
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,080
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

157
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,312
And the secret to achieve it is only just to please,

158
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,919
just please Him.

159
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,400
If you please Shiva, then you may be a rakshasa or anything,

160
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
He grants all kinds of boons.

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,080
But to a rakshasa He can only grant

162
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,298
the boon of longevity, of long life.

163
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:33,024
But to a saint, He'll grant the Satchitananda state.

164
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,720
So even if He grants anything to a rakshasa,

165
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,515
one should not ask questions about it.

166
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:46,758
He can give him longevity, what does it matter?

167
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,440
Even if you live for thousands of years and earn nothing out of it;

168
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,440
you never get your Realization.

169
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,760
So to a saint, He gives that eternal longevity

170
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,480
which comes through Spirit.

171
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,600
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattwa.

172
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,491
While Vishnu Tattva,

173
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:19,069
He gives ascent

174
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,474
to a saint

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,074
and light of wisdom

176
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:35,428
to see and understand everything in collective consciousness

177
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,536
And to a rakshasa He gives death,

178
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:45,199
He kills.

179
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:54,308
So for people who are not so deep,

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
it seems that why should Shiva

181
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,467
give any blessings of longevity to a rakshasa.

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:10,440
These are the characters of these different deities.

183
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,117
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants to live long,

184
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:24,560
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him

185
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,392
by praising Him, singing songs to Him,

186
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,452
by asking His blessings, by doing the tapas for Him,

187
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:37,511
talking about Shiva's innocence, he gets longevity.

188
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,360
Sometimes,

189
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,040
these rakshasas are better on the earth than in the subconscious.

190
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,200
They can be horrid.

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,760
They can gather some more bhoots

192
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,320
to torture human beings.

193
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,560
So it's better to keep them in the eyes of Vishnu.

194
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,650
He manages them better here

195
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:05,926
than to send them into the subconscious.

196
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,400
But Shiva's style is very different from that of Vishnu's style.

197
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:14,423
You have to have all kinds of styles

198
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:17,360
because you know there are so many permutations and combinations

199
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,880
in human beings.

200
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,480
If you have one style,

201
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
what will you do with the other style of human beings, you see?

202
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,920
So the style of Vishnu is

203
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,720
that if you are trying to be funny,

204
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,767
He plays tricks

205
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,902
and puts you right.

206
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,535
Say, a Sahaja Yogi -

207
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:43,201
He (Vishnu) is not interested if you [see], so much in other people,

208
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:45,177
but in Sahaja Yogis.

209
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:48,640
If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny;

210
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,720
say he wants to drink wine, "All right", He says, "Drink wine".

211
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,840
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick somewhere,

212
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,720
his cars falls off, or he is insulted somewhere.

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,194
Something happens to him, he is punished so badly

214
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:08,618
that he says, "Oh God, what have I done?"

215
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,679
That's Vishnu tattwa.

216
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,160
But Shiva is the other way round.

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,159
If you see Shiva's style is this,

218
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,679
that if you drink, He just disappears from your heart;

219
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,723
you have a heart attack and you die.

220
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
He also kills.

221
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,524
One kills directly -

222
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,439
in a positive way, He definitely kills;

223
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,680
the another one by recession.

224
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,760
If Shiva disappears, how can you exist?

225
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,308
That's one way.

226
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,319
Second way is that,

227
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,760
those who are born with Shiva tattwa

228
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,191
like our Sainath was -

229
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:53,000
Shirdi Sainath, or people like that -

230
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,760
even that they live, sometimes can do that -

231
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,720
they drink away all the wines of the world,

232
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,151
all the poisons of the world, like Shiva did.

233
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,521
So when Sainath found

234
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:10,760
that so many people were smoking this tobacco,

235
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
he smoked all the tobacco of the world,

236
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,160
tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra

237
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,440
so that nobody should get it.

238
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,283
That's the style of Shiva to take all the poison into Himself,

239
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,842
and to absorb all the poison within Himself.

240
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,280
He can deal with the most difficult things.

241
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,280
So the one dealing comes through the brain.

242
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,797
because Virata is in our brain,

243
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,559
acts through the brain.

244
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,280
So He plays tricks on you.

245
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,068
And that appeals to us because we can see

246
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,631
that He's killed someone. So we think,

247
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:52,600
"Very nice Mother, You have punished that person, it's good."

248
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,301
But Shiva Tattwa gives you the problems

249
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,040
which normally you cannot see,

250
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
but works out in a short time like that.

251
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,520
Like heart troubles

252
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,058
or a person who has a very poor Shiva Tattwa

253
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,397
can have all the incurable diseases of the world.

254
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,995
There nobody is killed,

255
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:27,209
but it's every minute the person is suffering.

256
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,600
That is the way Shiva corrects.

257
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,440
In us when Shiva Tattva is awakened

258
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,280
our priorities change absolutely.

259
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,440
I see now that those who have come, say,

260
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,080
to India from the West

261
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,787
have changed quite a lot in their priorities,

262
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:54,880
but still there is not so much change as it should be.

263
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,160
They are of course thousand times better

264
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,880
than their fellow beings who are not realized souls.

265
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,480
But still, attachment to things, attachment to money is quite a lot.

266
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,840
This detachment must work out.

267
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,927
See things are not correct in people

268
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,824
and the alertness is not there.

269
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:22,520
To give a very, very gross example of this, I will tell you that,

270
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,197
a gentleman, say, came and he was told that

271
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:31,080
You have to give, say, eleven rupees for Puja.

272
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,288
He said, "On principle we are not supposed to give".

273
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,920
So I mean, you are only paying even on principle

274
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,694
you are only paying for your food and lodging,

275
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,813
not for Puja.

276
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,920
The other side of it they will not even see

277
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,229
that Mother is spending so much for us extra

278
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,119
for which we are not paying anything.

279
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,806
It's not all found.

280
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,359
Like the other day, I said

281
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,120
that people are now asking Me to pay for this,

282
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,168
then tomorrow they will say, "Pay for our house rents".

283
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,245
It was so. It was such a condition, once upon a time in London,

284
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:10,919
when I started the ashram,

285
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,214
that they asked for all the utensils in the ashram,

286
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:16,201
I paid for the rent, paid for everything, and ultimately

287
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:19,960
they said, "We don't have an ironing board, please send us".

288
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,903
From that, it's not so bad now, I mean, of course.

289
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:30,400
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees for taxi,

290
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,671
they will think that, "Oh we have to pay for taxi,

291
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:33,955
Mother is supposed to pay".

292
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:37,677
But if I pay 7000- 8000 rupees for you to go to Haridwar,

293
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,399
that's all right. That's good.

294
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,825
That nobody wants to find out how Mother is paying for us.

295
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,975
It's surprising

296
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:51,559
and this disturbs Me very much

297
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,781
that what is your attitude towards that.

298
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,360
The pleasing should be done with full heart.

299
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Say if you have to buy any presents for your friends, or anything,

300
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,360
you don't mind spending money for that.

301
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,680
But for Puja you have objections.

302
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,960
For your laundry you used to pay always, I mean

303
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,440
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed how much money was spent.

304
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,760
But 21 rupees, the principle was involved.

305
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,320
Imagine. Look at it.

306
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,789
If you look at it, you will be shocked at yourself.

307
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,882
But that shows despite all this,

308
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,079
you have got your Realization.

309
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,939
See the generosity.

310
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:41,439
 It's very, very, you see, it's very gross.

311
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:44,560
It's very gross.

312
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,560
So the detachment from this gross life must go away.

313
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,215
But an ordinary villager understands better,

314
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,039
because he is innocent.

315
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,480
He is innocent. Because you are not innocent.

316
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,960
That's why you see everything from your mind.

317
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,320
You think with it.

318
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,480
How much we paid, how much this is, this is that, this, that.

319
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,720
But an innocent villager, even if he has four annas,

320
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
he would like to do something,

321
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,960
"Mother, that's all I have".

322
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,971
We have a parable in the Bible.

323
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,160
And this is what it is. One should see our detachment starts

324
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,754
at a very baser level of money.

325
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
You need not have any friends...

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,378
What is the need to give to any friends?

327
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,680
What are these friends for?

328
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:49,368
Except for Shiva Tattva, what other friend you need?

329
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,876
Think of it, without God, what is your life?

330
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,057
So the detachment must start. The priorities must change

331
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:03,278
and you must know that God is the One

332
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,400
who is your Friend, who is your Father, who is your Mother,

333
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,069
who is to be worshipped. There is nothing else.

334
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,200
Tana, mana, dhana - everything is for God.

335
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,480
Of course, I don't want anything from you, you know that.

336
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,240
But that should be the attitude of a person.

337
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:33,506
So the first - this attitude comes in a person.

338
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:37,320
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great advantage

339
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,920
that those who have developed this attitude,

340
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,080
have been helped so much materially

341
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:50,028
that you find the proof of it, immediately. The proof is there.

342
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:53,564
and those who do not take to this kind of a thing, suffer.

343
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,795
So the proof is there.

344
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,366
I must give you an example of a

345
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,519
goldsmith.

346
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:12,320
I had given him something to be made for the Puja.

347
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,040
A lot of gold was given, everything.

348
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,438
And still, stupidly, he tried to make money out of that.

349
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
And he got cancer and he died.

350
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,752
I didn't do anything.

351
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:31,007
But I knew he had made money, I knew that all.

352
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:32,942
I knew lots of things.

353
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:36,800
I didn't say anything to him, nothing, never

354
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,895
never even mentioned.

355
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:42,276
He got cancer and he died, he is no more.

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,040
Because Shiva Tattwa disappeared.

357
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,153
This was for a Puja,

358
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:54,455
the money of the saints,

359
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,529
something was to be made

360
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,559
and he should not have done it.

361
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
The proof is just there.

362
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,800
Now, those who knew him got a fright of their lives,

363
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
"Oh God, now no more of this from us at least."

364
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,840
But those who have been surrendered about their money part also

365
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,200
- not that I take anything from them nor I want anything from you -

366
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,424
but, still the attitude I am saying is different,

367
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,702
they have gone up, they have made money,

368
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:31,240
they are very rich, they are very well to do, they are all right,

369
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,736
they get so much blessings, everything.

370
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,433
This is the first Nabhi chakra's detachment.

371
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,703
We should start by putting Shiva on top.

372
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,135
Every attachment can be attacked with Shiva Tattwa,

373
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:56,975
because Shiva Tattva is brilliant like a diamond, brilliant.

374
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,000
Every facet can be cleansed out, very simply

375
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,360
through our Kundalini awakening and through our alertness.

376
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:12,800
And one after that you can see there are other attachments we have.

377
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,760
This is friendship, sympathies, friendships.

378
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
Sympathies always go to a person

379
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,040
who is in need or something like that.

380
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,034
We have known sympathies have tortured so many people.

381
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,640
The other way also could be that you hate someone too much,

382
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,600
you love someone too much, some sort of a thing like that.

383
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,682
So detachment comes that you do not hate nor you love anyone.

384
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,520
You leave it to God to decide.

385
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,440
That's the kind of a detachment that you leave it to God.

386
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,400
"God, please" - that is His exploit. "I am not going to judge.

387
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,160
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini, I awaken their Kundalini.

388
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,214
If it works out well and good, if it doesn't work out well and good.

389
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,560
So you have detached yourself,

390
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
from the responsibility of judging others.

391
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,320
Only your judgment is on Kundalini, if it works out, all right.

392
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,298
But, you are just like a barometer that's all,

393
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:21,133
or like a machine that cures.

394
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,839
You are not involved into it.

395
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,080
So this involvement into personal lives and personal relationships

396
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,492
like mother, sister, brother, every sort of a nonsense,

397
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,075
must be taken out.

398
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:35,430
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

399
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:41,520
you must just get after her and see that she is put right.

400
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,720
That's very important; mother has to be all right.

401
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,244
If she's not all right, you tell her,

402
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,791
"I'm not going to eat food from your hand, finished.

403
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:52,080
You get your vibrations, all right".

404
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,898
You tell her that, "You better take to Realization

405
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,240
otherwise I will not have anything to do with you.

406
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll just come, see you, talk to you, go away".

407
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,120
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.

408
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,260
You must cure your mother. Very important,

409
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,700
because mother is a part of Sahaja Yoga,

410
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,909
it's very important.

411
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:14,839
But many people I have seen

412
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,497
just do not know how to resist.

413
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:21,040
You must protest, go on protesting one after another

414
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,132
because that's the greatest thing you are doing for your mother.

415
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,320
What else can you give it to her?

416
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,160
Anything you give, the whole world, has no meaning,

417
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,219
except correcting your mother for the better life,

418
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,297
an eternal life, life of God.

419
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,600
Then your wife -

420
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,000
wife is a very dangerous situation.

421
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,099
If the wife is negative,

422
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,575
she will go on putting into your head things,

423
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,279
which will work out at a odd time,

424
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,368
and you will be amazed how you slipped out these things

425
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,120
and how you said these things.

426
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,992
Why should you have done it?

427
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,840
Why did you do this?

428
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
But the wife is to be told that,

429
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,867
"You have to behave yourself, you have to get all right, nothing doing.

430
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,342
 And there is no compromise.

431
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,316
You be in another room, I will be in another room.

432
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:19,280
You should get well. I am not going to have..."

433
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,200
Because that is even much more dangerous,

434
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,760
because you know if the woman is catching,

435
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,189
then there are very serious diseases who develop

436
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:32,816
with the Mooladhara problem.

437
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,800
So you have to be strict with your wife.

438
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,830
You should make her, you should say,

439
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:39,917
"I'll not eat any food with your hands.

440
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,282
I'll have nothing to do, I'll not talk to you,

441
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:46,120
I'll just come and sleep in another room and go out.

442
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,169
You better not touch my clothes.

443
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:54,971
If you don't listen to me then I have nothing to do with you

444
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:58,240
You better... I'm your husband,

445
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,693
and whatever dharma I follow, you have to follow,

446
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,280
if you don't want to listen to me,

447
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,969
then I have nothing to do with you".

448
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,840
The wife can also do the same thing with the husband.

449
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,400
Gradually showing indifference in a way,

450
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,199
that he understands that it doesn't bring love.

451
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:17,560
That's how women corrected men long time back.

452
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,252
Nowadays, of course women, if you give them something,

453
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,560
they are get pleased.

454
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
Even if there is a keep,

455
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,640
as long as they are giving diamonds to the wife

456
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,280
she is quite pleased with the keep.

457
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,560
Still in India it's not accepted.

458
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,040
But I have seen in the West nobody minds.

459
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
If the husband has ten keeps, doesn't matter,

460
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,640
as long as he is giving you the money, all right, nobody minds it.

461
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,080
That's very funny.

462
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:51,000
So wife's relation, mother's relations, husband's relations,

463
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,920
close relations must be corrected.

464
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,280
And children must be guarded.

465
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,360
You shouldn't allow your children to go away, to the wrong things.

466
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,120
If they are doing wrong things, they are not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

467
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,680
you are duty bound;

468
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,160
you should say, I'm not going to pay you any money, nothing doing.

469
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,038
I'll not see your faces,

470
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,399
if you do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

471
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,981
What else are you going to give to your children, but God?

472
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:24,121
You can do it.

473
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,867
You all can do it.

474
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,987
But one should know I need not do it.

475
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360
So many people say

476
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,840
that, "Mother, Your husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi."

477
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,880
That's all right. I know where to bring him in;

478
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,280
I know when to bring My children in;

479
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,040
because if they were in everybody would have said,

480
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,995
"They have floated a family enterprise."

481
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:02,280
As long as they are out of it, it's a very good idea

482
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,120
specially in India.

483
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,360
So best thing is if they oppose Me, I keep all of them out;

484
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,600
My brothers... Imagine, My own brothers, My own -

485
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:18,890
I mean, they all have tremendous respect for Me, no doubt.

486
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,254
Even My brother said that,

487
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:22,760
"Thank God, You are staying in my room now,

488
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,652
so the vibrations will be very good for me.

489
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:27,520
And what do You think of my vibrations?"

490
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,440
Everything he says, but he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

491
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,120
I have given Realization to all of them, everything is there,

492
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,480
but they are not Sahaja Yogis - apart of this.

493
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,120
Otherwise they will be in charge of money, you see.

494
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,200
"What money you get? Now, come along

495
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,160
this is the money we have, all the problems.

496
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,400
With all these relations around, you don't know.

497
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,840
Somebody will go and say, "Shri Mataji said so."

498
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,040
"Oh, that's the daughter of Mataji has said" - so that becomes rule.

499
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't want all these pressures on My head.

500
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,320
That's the best way; I wish our politicians understand that:

501
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,080
never have your relations around.

502
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,920
That's the best way to administer.

503
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,480
If you have your relations around,

504
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,760
then you will never do right things.

505
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,914
Or even if you do right things, your relations will spoil it.

506
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,080
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

507
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,920
that you should not try to help your relations

508
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,829
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

509
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,040
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

510
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,323
then you bring your mother and make her sit in front of Me.

511
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
First correct her vibrations.

512
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,680
Put her right and then bring her.

513
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,120
Correct my father, correct my mother is not Mother's responsibility,

514
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,440
it's your own.

515
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,000
When they are all right, then as you bring flowers to Me,

516
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,196
bring your relations as a very good present from your family.

517
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,888
That's a much better thing

518
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,171
than to be like this, that I have to clear.

519
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:17,235
If one is a Sahaja Yogi,

520
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:19,742
all his three generations up and down,

521
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:23,639
this side and that side have to cure; [that is done].

522
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,134
Like Malhotra made Me do.

523
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,400
So one should detach from these family ties

524
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,719
and these emotional imbalances we have, emotional problems we have

525
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,200
by understanding that the only thing that these people should have

526
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,871
is Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,240
And some people should not be in Sahaja Yoga.

528
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,080
Like as I said - My own husband, and My daughter and My relations,

529
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,649
I keep them out.

530
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:00,200
All such people if there are any,

531
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
you should not also have them anywhere near Sahaja Yoga.

532
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,039
You should be discrete to find out.

533
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,480
Although, all these, My relations are very dharmic people,

534
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,000
extremely dharmic, very good,

535
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,160
very self-respecting, all qualities they have got - everything,

536
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,262
ready made, but they are not in Sahaja Yoga.

537
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,000
So none of you can say somebody said so, so one said so.

538
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:31,600
It has to be Mother has to say.

539
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,101
This detachment has to come.

540
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,160
It takes time, especially with Indians.

541
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,269
All the time they are worried about their children,

542
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,888
or a mother or a father.

543
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,598
Go on and on and on and on and on, see, years together,

544
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:51,680
"my son, my daughter", "my son, my father" – all the time.

545
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,640
Now by God's grace

546
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,560
so many have got rid of all their responsibilities somehow,

547
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,640
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is.

548
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,200
So they are now settled down onto themselves,

549
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,920
because you are your own responsibility.

550
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,001
So this detachment must be brought,

551
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,280
those who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

552
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,880
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga blessings.

553
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,120
We are going to be blessings.

554
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,760
[With that] pride if you'll be in the family, "All right,

555
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,200
if you want to have Sahaja Yoga, you have it.

556
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,120
But not to force them on Sahaja Yoga.

557
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,131
But you can force Sahaja Yoga on them;

558
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,951
the stage has come that you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga to them.

559
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,298
In the beginning I used to say, "Don't talk to them."

560
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,805
But those who are useless,

561
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,960
if they are not to be brought in Sahaja Yoga, tell them,

562
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,180
"You are not good for Sahaja Yoga, better not ask me."

563
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,040
Then they will come.

564
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,360
Some people you should show complete indifference,

565
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,040
"You are incapable, you are no good, you are too materialistic".

566
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,886
Then that person will say, "I will prove that I am"

567
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,774
All these detachments take place

568
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:06,440
and then the detachments are at Nabhi chakras,

569
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,040
you rise up to your emotional side at the Heart chakra.

570
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,749
And then you have to have

571
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,496
the detachment even of a kind of a collectivity,

572
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,810
that we think it's collectivity.

573
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,667
I call the fraternity of the bhoots,

574
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:28,497
not collectivity.

575
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:34,020
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group;

576
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:43,000
and they will have a very strong objection

577
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,480
to everything that is sensible.

578
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:49,240
And they will have suggestions for everything.

579
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,404
There has to be no suggestions at all.

580
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,360
There are no alternatives, because Shiva is absolute.

581
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:07,271
Once one said is said. You just do it and see - that's the best.

582
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:13,393
Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless.

583
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,360
But there is no alternative for Shiva Tattva.

584
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:27,280
I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that, "You organize, say,

585
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,720
program for seven days outside, with other people.

586
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,243
It was sensible because I knew it was to rain.

587
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,216
And it has to rain also.

588
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:37,533
Rain can be stopped,

589
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:40,007
but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see.

590
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:43,639
We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis, can we?

591
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,600
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important so I said,

592
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
"Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis."

593
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,321
Now they started an alternative, only thinking that

594
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,338
"You see, they won't be comfortable and..."

595
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:57,766
I mean it was good, but on a other level,

596
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,118
that they will not be comfortable with Sahaja Yogis,

597
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,800
another level.

598
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,593
But there has to be understanding

599
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:06,480
if Mother has said it, it must be done whatever it is.

600
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,120
Even if She says, "You kill somebody", you have to kill.

601
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,040
Keep it like that, to that extent.

602
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,920
Keep to the maximum.

603
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,240
Even if She says, "You have to die now", you should die.

604
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:28,080
If She says, "All  right, you tell lies",

605
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,080
"All right, I'll tell lies".

606
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,880
Like Radhaji; She said, "What is my punyas, what is my papas.

607
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,800
I am in His heart. What can I do? Whatever He does, [He does]."

608
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,720
That is Shiva Tattwa.

609
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:44,656
When it is awakened, you see,

610
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,159
it at least recognizes this Shiva in Me.

611
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,912
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattwa.

612
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:58,160
It understands because at Shiva Tattwa you don't commit any sins,

613
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,606
you are sinless.

614
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,217
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless;

615
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,959
there is no sin in you.

616
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,000
If, supposing according to human understanding,

617
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,087
if Shiva leaves a person dies.

618
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:15,159
Then it's sinful. Why to leave anybody?

619
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,624
It's sinful, isn't it?

620
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:20,153
For all common purposes, common understanding, we'll think

621
00:39:20,354 --> 00:39:24,113
that it is sinful for Shiva to leave the person

622
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:25,959
and make the person die.

623
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,600
For example, a lady dies, her children are left behind,

624
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,720
then one can blame Shiva for that,

625
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,095
that, "See now You went away, and these children are now

626
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:40,106
without a mother or without a father", something like that.

627
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:45,112
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does is sinless.

628
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,600
So whatever you do is sinless.

629
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,823
The idea of sin is finished

630
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:53,902
because who commits sin is your ego.

631
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,235
Ego commits sin.

632
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,520
But if you have no ego, there's no sin,

633
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
neither they are not doing anything.

634
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,491
You stand in Akarma.

635
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:09,759
Say the sun is shining, is shining sharp,

636
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,197
and somebody wants to stand in the sun,

637
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,360
then he gets burns.

638
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,534
It's not the fault of the sun.

639
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:18,931
The sun is shining,

640
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,520
That's the job of sun.

641
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,440
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is doing it. He's not sinful.

642
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,201
It's our mental attitude makes us think,

643
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:31,959
"This is sin", "this is not sin".

644
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,840
But when we have ego, we are committing sins.

645
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,800
If you ask a tiger,

646
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,640
"You are committing a sin because you are eating a cow".

647
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
He will say, "I never knew what a sin was.

648
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,600
I don't know what sin is."

649
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,480
It's a story when some missionaries

650
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,520
were going away from a village, you see.

651
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,230
So the villagers, poor, innocent

652
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,319
you know, they just got up to thank him,

653
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,920
and said, "Thank God, when you came here you told us there is sin.

654
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,773
We didn't know what sin was".

655
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:08,297
For innocent people, they don't know what is sin.

656
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,880
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

657
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,146
It obeys the other source of innocence.

658
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,520
So there is no sin for a person who is the Spirit.

659
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,105
For Shiva there is no sin,

660
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:26,907
whether He wants to give His blessings to a rakshasa

661
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:30,983
or to a saint, there is no sin for Him,

662
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:34,479
because He is bholenath.

663
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,152
He is beyond, He's beyond sin.

664
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:41,906
Whatever He does, He is beyond sin,

665
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:44,711
because ego cannot envelope Him.

666
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,216
 There is no ego.

667
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:50,080
Because we have ego, we commit sins.

668
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,262
Once ego is finished we are no more there,

669
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:56,475
so who commits sins?

670
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,720
When we are not there, who is committing the sin?

671
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,320
Shiva can't commit sins, so we are the Shiva,

672
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,200
so we cannot commit sins.

673
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,360
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

674
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,760
at the mental level, is also wrong.

675
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,054
I give any - anything I say,

676
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:17,305
immediately there will be ten suggestions.

677
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:20,320
I try all these tricks with you.

678
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,993
Because you are used to conferences, you see.

679
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,640
So I said, "All right, Subramanian, 
what do you have to say about it?"

680
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,608
Because after all, lord Subramanian's mind is there. Must ask him.

681
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:47,492
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I'll ask Gavin, Mohan, all these people,

682
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,360
"Now, what do you have to say?"

683
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,360
And then they give their suggestions.

684
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,453
But if you see,

685
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:04,350
in the conference of all the Divine Deities,

686
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,120
there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative.

687
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,800
No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing.

688
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,601
Absolute, itt's absolute.

689
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:21,742
Nobody gives any suggestions to Me. Never.

690
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:27,862
No question.

691
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:33,120
They won't listen to you, they won't listen to anyone.

692
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,429
There's no question. Such harmony; complete obedience.

693
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,560
And not only, they are fixed with their qualities.

694
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,160
If they are told that, "You have to do it", they'll do it.

695
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,000
This is the difference.

696
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,260
Then, try.

697
00:43:57,459 --> 00:43:59,599
Sometimes it appears, you see -

698
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,849
if I say, "All right, go this way and you will find the place",

699
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,440
but you won't find.

700
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,364
So you will say, "See, Mother, You said to go this way

701
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,721
that's why we went this way and we didn't find the church."

702
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,640
Now there it is not that I'm saying that you will find the church,

703
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,539
it is I am trying to see

704
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:19,959
what you think.

705
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,764
I am telling you My own tricks, all right, so be careful.

706
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,754
I'll tell you although "Go this way",

707
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:30,479
"Now, you didn't find the church, I'm sorry.

708
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,560
I should not have told you. Or you should have gone..."

709
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,200
But that's not true. I must tell you, that's not true.

710
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,724
What I'm trying to see, what you are saying about this.

711
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,385
Now if you are clever, you would say,

712
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:46,409
"I went there, I didn't see the place,

713
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,239
but I saw something else, Mother.

714
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,644
That's the reason You sent me there. Now I know why You sent me there".

715
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:56,529
That's it. Then I know that he is Sahaja Yogi.

716
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,635
But if you say: "Oh I went there

717
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:01,719
because I thought I will find this thing,

718
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,240
but, it was not there. And You sent me, You sent me".

719
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:10,840
Finished. If you say that, "You said so and it happened".

720
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,649
Oh, I did say, no doubt.

721
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,119
But what I said was just to play a trick on you.

722
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,200
Because one of the natures of your Mother is Mahamaya.

723
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,360
So be careful. How you react

724
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,520
is very important for Me to see how far you have gone.

725
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,023
This is one of the ways you are judged.

726
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:34,440
But for a villager, it's a different thing if you see.

727
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,360
If I tell him: "Now if you want

728
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,400
Me to go to that village, see, take the cart,

729
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,120
or take the bullock cart this way, he'll take it".

730
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,071
But there will be a ditch, so I'll get hit.

731
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:56,320
So he will say, "Mother, I'm sorry, you got hit.

732
00:45:57,203 --> 00:46:00,280
But I could have avoided it.”

733
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,080
You see, so he takes the responsibility upon himself.

734
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
He takes everything upon himself.

735
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,154
Because you asked Me so I had to go that way

736
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:10,989
but I could have avoided it if I was careful.

737
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:15,666
So this is the difference you know, not to put responsibility.

738
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:19,040
It's a common human nature is to put responsibility on somebody else.

739
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:21,560
Best is to put on Mother.

740
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,407
But in that you lose all your punyas.

741
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,080
So, "The responsibility is mine. I must have done some mistake."

742
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,120
I must have done some mistake somewhere

743
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,320
or else maybe, that Mother wants me to learn something in this.

744
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,160
Every time you do something, I tell you something,

745
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,080
it's just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything.

746
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,240
Do you think that way, that I have to learn something now anymore?

747
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,240
Not anymore. So you have to learn something.

748
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,040
And that is what if you understand; then a kind of a detachment

749
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,840
will build in you and a surrender.

750
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,360
You will be amazed that you will be so much

751
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,903
relieved of nonsensical headaches that you have

752
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:14,240
and the burdens you carry.

753
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,360
If you understand that, "The whole joke,

754
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,080
the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother

755
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,885
and I am just playing into it".

756
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,439
It's so simple.

757
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,400
That is to be felt, to be understood.

758
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,040
And the enjoyment lies in that.

759
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,120
Not in judging or finding alternatives.

760
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,600
You try it. Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much.

761
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,040
And so many things. Every minute, I'll give you an example of that.

762
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,870
I'll give you an example of Gregoire

763
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:53,880
last time I went to his house.

764
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,520
He tortured My life for his wife.

765
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,320
When will she have her delivery, how will she have,

766
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,880
who is going to stay with her?

767
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,240
Morning till evening, he had one talk.

768
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,596
All right, I said, "Something will be done.

769
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:07,359
You can have this lady to stay.."

770
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,600
"But then how will I go to India?" I mean, "I" was so important.

771
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,301
Then he didn't realize that time, you see.

772
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:17,608
He thought it was so important to do that.

773
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:19,960
Ultimately quite before going, I told him,

774
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,520
"Gregoire, you troubled Me too much this time.

775
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,920
But it's all right." So he said, "I'm sorry".

776
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,543
Then he telephoned Me one day saying, "Mother,

777
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:31,429
my wife is in for abortion.

778
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,742
She has gone to the hospital, there is no chance."

779
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:35,392
I said, "Forget it.

780
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:37,880
You go back to the hospital, she will be all right".

781
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,239
So he went to the hospital, they said, "A miracle".

782
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,559
"She's perfectly all right, there's no problem. She's all right."

783
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,040
So it came into his head, as he told Me,

784
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,320
"Oh, Mother is looking after, why should I worry?

785
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,421
Why should I have worries then? This is first thing.

786
00:48:55,622 --> 00:49:00,360
Then, the child was born earlier than time.

787
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:03,440
Then he came to know, with this.

788
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,840
So also I convinced him, that "What I say

789
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,721
what I do, you know that,

790
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,720
that I look after you.

791
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,374
But when you take up responsibility upon yourself

792
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,627
and start thinking about it,

793
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,400
then I cannot help.

794
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,600
So just know that, leave it to God.

795
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,728
It's all for your good, for your 'hita'.

796
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:27,519
Everything is for your 'hita',

797
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,903
whatever it is - sometimes I have to shout at you,

798
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:33,056
sometimes I have to correct you,

799
00:49:33,257 --> 00:49:35,627
sometimes I have to tell you that, "Don't come here."

800
00:49:35,828 --> 00:49:39,720
Some people who touch Me, you see, can give me horrible sensations.

801
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,601
Then I say, "You just don't come here. You don't stand before Me,

802
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:44,989
you get out from here." That helps them.

803
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,409
But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave

804
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,121
because the bhoots want to trouble Me.

805
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:56,000
So this point if you understand, you will get completely detached

806
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,840
and will know that for our good, for our betterment

807
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,642
we must keep Mother pleased

808
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:04,954
and these things if we do, by displeasing Her,

809
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:07,920
we are going to be finished.

810
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,840
Now to understand this, what you need - not age, not position,

811
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,138
not your qualifications, nothing - you need a wise mind,

812
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:21,440
deep personality.

813
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,817
I've seen very young people are so sensible

814
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:28,239
though their parents are stupid, absolutely stupid people.

815
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,640
So you just need a wise, deep personality, to do it

816
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,778
and that you should try to develop.

817
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:38,240
That comes only sticking on to Shiva tattwa,

818
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,200
which is a solid thing, which is Shiva, Achara

819
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,960
which doesn't move, absolute.

820
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,960
It is not relative, it's not relative at all.

821
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,964
it's not related to anything, absolute.

822
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,959
That gives you the depth,

823
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,040
that depth which is required to settle down, to go deep.

824
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:03,840
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity

825
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,678
to go straight down deep into it.

826
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:23,411
That is very important.

827
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:29,341
And all this I hope with the Puja today

828
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,000
we'll try to settle you

829
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,680
into that great principle of Shiva.

830
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,720
Let your attention, every particle of your attention be filled,

831
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,711
sparkled and rejoice

832
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:57,009
by that blessing of Shiva tattwa.

833
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:02,180
I bless you all! May God bless you all!

834
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:12,920
So to begin with, we are going to worship the Devi first of all,

835
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,640
and then the Shiva.

836
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,799
So first we will have Ganesha's Avahanam,

837
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,680
means we have to establish Shri Ganesha. That is important.

838
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:30,400
And then, after that we have to say the names of Vishnu,

839
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,439
whatever – because His names are to be said

840
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,840
which are the ascending names.

841
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:40,386
And after that

842
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:45,262
we will be having the location

843
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:47,919
and everything described where we are doing it,

844
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,670
why we are doing it, the Puja.

845
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:53,243
Then we’ll worship Devi.

846
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:56,200
We take 108 names of the Devi.

847
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,120
I think you all should remember these 108 names by heart.

848
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,315
Have you got printed Devi’s names?

849
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:07,780
Gavin, have you got copies?

850
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,054
You have got them?

851
00:57:12,255 --> 00:57:15,615
Have you got these with you? Do you have booklets?
