1
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:38,948
I am happy that you all have adjusted
yourselves in this small space.

2
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,651
When there is love and understanding,

3
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:48,134
little space can occupy many hearts.

4
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:55,300
But when there is no large heart

5
00:00:55,508 --> 00:01:02,250
then whatever one may get is just never
sufficient.

6
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:11,238
Today, we are going to worship Shiva
Tattwa within us, principle of Shiva.

7
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:17,230
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important,

8
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,990
because Shiva is the ultimate we have
to achieve.

9
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:26,809
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

10
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:36,078
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim
of everything else.

11
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:44,201
The rest of it is all created, like Vishnu
Tattwa

12
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:52,265
and Brahmadeva, just to create human
beings,

13
00:01:52,466 --> 00:02:01,731
to evolve them and then ultimately lead
them to Shiva.

14
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:05,111
That’s the ultimate.

15
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:16,885
But human beings get so involved into
the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas

16
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:21,986
that even to get into Vishnu Tattwa is
difficult.

17
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:28,564
They get involved into the five elements
which have created us.

18
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,329
That is the outermost being within us.

19
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:41,237
All the chakras have the outermost, we
can say the, just the vessel,

20
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:49,143
but the desire to be the Spirit

21
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:56,568
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

22
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:04,239
So we have to see inward towards ourselves
as Sahaja Yogis,

23
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:09,480
“Do we have that desire entirely,

24
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:15,442
or we have still many desires hanging
around?”

25
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:23,241
You see, the greatest problem is
of the Nabhi chakra,

26
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:27,397
whether it is in the East or the West.

27
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:36,454
Some people still have hankering for
the baser search of food,

28
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:45,488
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja
Yoga, of Nabhi chakra.

29
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:52,764
Then, still some people have sense
of possessions and money quite a lot.

30
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,600
And subtler and subtler they grow,

31
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:59,956
still the detachment doesn’t develop
within them.

32
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:07,254
It becomes subtler.

33
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:14,650
As you grow subtler, the attachment becomes
subtler and difficult to get out.

34
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:18,395
Specially people who come up as leaders
in Sahaja Yoga,

35
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:24,735
or closer to Sahaja Yoga, are always
under attack.

36
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:32,544
They are attacked maybe by their husbands,
wives, brothers, sisters,

37
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:35,969
sons, children, something like that.

38
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:43,900
And that makes it worse

39
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:49,936
because all such leaders who are attacked

40
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:57,644
try to displease all the deities by small
things here and there.

41
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,966
The whole behaviour has to be understood

42
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:10,259
that you have become a subtler person
and you are rising higher,

43
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,462
so naturally the negative forces are going
to attack you.

44
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:21,620
Always the front line is under attack, not
the back line.

45
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:27,308
So those who are in the front are always
under attack

46
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,186
and they have to be very careful as to how
they are behaving.

47
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:38,209
For if there is a sly person, he will
become sly, but subtler sly.

48
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,319
He will not just become the other way
round, his slyness will become subtler.

49
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,372
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will
become miserly in a subtler way.

50
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,757
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

51
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,220
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler
way.

52
00:05:56,421 --> 00:06:05,746
But to get rid of these things within you,
you have to go to the other side of it.

53
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,788
Say if you are miserly, you become
absolutely generous;

54
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:11,585
give up everything that you have.

55
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:18,396
Don’t be calculated, don’t talk of money,
don’t worry about money.

56
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:25,592
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,
you should go the other way round.

57
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:31,750
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,
you cannot get rid of these things.

58
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,706
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very
hot-tempered, then become so mild

59
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,687
that even if somebody beats you,
it’s all right.

60
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:41,706
Whatever one says it’s all right.

61
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:47,610
That’s how you get rid of your habits which
become subtler and subtler.

62
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:57,130
There’s another way of dealing with it:
being alert.

63
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,884
When you are alert, you start seeing
yourself

64
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,427
as a separate person with the habits that
it has,

65
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,661
and then you start understanding why you
are behaving,

66
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:09,369
“Oh, I understand, I knew you before,
ten years back,

67
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,223
before my realisation. I know Mr.,
you are like this.”

68
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:22,208
And then take the juxtaposition against
that personality and just shoot it off.

69
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,982
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided
person,

70
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:29,391
whatever you may do for that person,
he will become subtler and subtler.

71
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:34,663
Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start
just crying for nothing at all

72
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:39,047
and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he
thinks about, analyses

73
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:46,424
he will become analyser of Sahaja Yoga
also, in a subtler way.

74
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,039
Then what they should do is to stand before
the photograph

75
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,964
and see the reflection, “That’s the other
one who died.”

76
00:07:54,165 --> 00:08:02,840
And just try to make fun of that or shout
at it, depends on.

77
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:08,701
If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better
to make fun, because it’s stupid.

78
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,191
And if it is that one that takes
aggression, then shout at it,

79
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,194
“What do you mean, by taking aggression
like this?”

80
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:22,827
All these things, you see, are keeping you
away from reality.

81
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:28,754
Your being has to be cleansed. With your
help only I can do it.

82
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,996
Many people say, “Mother, You are
all-powerful.”

83
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:34,586
All right, I am and I can do everything.

84
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:38,660
But only thing I cannot surpass your
freedom.

85
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:45,247
That’s a fact, I cannot cross over your
freedom.

86
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:52,270
And when I cannot cross your freedom,
you have to cross that.

87
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,012
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

88
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,997
then I will bestow upon you all
the blessings.

89
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:04,967
But if you want to stand outside, I am not
the one to put you in with a pistol.

90
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,588
No, that’s not the way it will work out.

91
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,196
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must
know

92
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:18,259
that at every moment you are free,
and freer, and freest.

93
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,991
The more free you become, the worse
is your situation,

94
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:25,076
as far as the facing of the negativity is
concerned.

95
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:29,310
Say if there are four persons are around
you,

96
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,074
they will be first attacked.

97
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:38,071
Naturally, you can understand the front
line is always under attack,

98
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:40,177
not the back side.

99
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,966
Though according to the law, it should be
the back side

100
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,240
because all these horrible, negative forces
should come from the back.

101
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,325
But they are very clever, they know
that the back

102
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:54,048
sometimes drop out by themselves, 
so no need to go that side.

103
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,989
They try the front line.

104
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,620
And those who think they are in charge
and responsible

105
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:05,490
have to be very careful as to how they
behave,

106
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:08,993
how they are responsible, how they work
it out,

107
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,258
if they are keeping their old habits
at a subtler level

108
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,279
or they are just fighting it out. It’s very
important.

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,784
And this is how intelligently you can
manage yourselves, very well.

110
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:27,348
Then once you become detached,

111
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:32,208
you know, from all these things -
only at mental level.

112
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:35,180
The spiritual level I’ll look after. But
at mental level,

113
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:41,449
you must come to logical conclusion that,
“I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

114
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,599
I have to be alert about this nonsense that
exists within me.”

115
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:59,722
Shiva Tattwa is innocent, absolutely
innocent it is.

116
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:04,131
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

117
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:09,072
And the secret to achieve it is only just
to please, just to please Him.

118
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:13,538
If you please Shiva, then you may be
a rakshasa or anything,

119
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,304
He grants all kinds of boons.

120
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:26,193
But to a rakshasa He can only grant
the boon of longevity, of long life.

121
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:33,990
But to a saint, He’ll grant the Sat-Chit-
Ananda state.

122
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:41,759
So even if He grants anything to
a rakshasa,

123
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,626
one should not ask questions about it.

124
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:46,605
He can give him longevity, what does it
matter?

125
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:52,571
Even if you live for thousands of years
and earn nothing out of it;

126
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,431
you never get your realisation.

127
00:11:54,632 --> 00:12:01,827
So to a saint, He gives that eternal
longevity

128
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:05,460
which comes through Spirit.

129
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:13,782
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattwa.
While Vishnu Tattwa,

130
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:29,073
He gives ascent to a saint and light
of wisdom

131
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:36,545
to see and understand everything
in collective consciousness,

132
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:45,285
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

133
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:54,771
So for people who are not so deep,

134
00:12:54,972 --> 00:13:02,647
it seems that why should Shiva give any
blessings of longevity to a rakshasa.

135
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:11,362
These are the characters of these different
deities.

136
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:18,258
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants
to live long,

137
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:26,250
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him by praising
Him,

138
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:32,549
singing songs to Him, by asking His
blessings, by doing the tapas for Him,

139
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,977
talking about Shiva’s innocence, he gets
longevity.

140
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:46,112
Sometimes, these rakshasas are better
on the earth than in the subconscious.

141
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:48,376
They can be horrid.

142
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:53,469
They can gather some more bhoots to torture
human beings.

143
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,470
So it’s better to keep them in the eyes
of Vishnu.

144
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:07,009
He manages them better here than to send
them into the subconscious.

145
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:12,495
But Shiva’s style is very different from
that of Vishnu’s style.

146
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,891
You have to have all kinds of styles
because you know

147
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:19,044
there are so many permutations and
combinations in human beings.

148
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:21,490
If you have one style, what will you do
with the other style

149
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,818
of human beings, you see?

150
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:31,843
So the style of Vishnu is that if you are
trying to be funny,

151
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:38,583
He plays tricks and puts you right.

152
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:41,649
Say, a Sahaja Yogi – He (Vishnu) is not
interested if you [see],

153
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,331
so much in other people, but in Sahaja
Yogis.

154
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:51,204
If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny; say he
wants to drink wine,

155
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,835
“All right”, He says, “Drink wine.”

156
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:58,951
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick
somewhere,

157
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:02,710
his car falls off, or he is insulted
somewhere.

158
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,989
Something happens to him, he is punished
so badly

159
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,782
that he says, “Oh God, what have I done?”
That’s Vishnu tattwa.

160
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,141
But Shiva is the other way round. If you
see Shiva’s style is this,

161
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:18,235
If you see Shiva's style

162
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:24,517
that if you drink, He just disappears
from your heart;

163
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:28,244
you have a heart attack and you die.

164
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:35,522
He also kills. One kills directly – in
a positive way, He definitely kills;

165
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:39,120
the another one by recession. If Shiva
disappears,

166
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,306
how can you exist? That’s one way.

167
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:46,891
Second way is that those who are born
with Shiva tattwa,

168
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:53,112
like our Sainath was, Shirdi Sainath,
or people like that -

169
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:56,869
even the Devi sometimes can do that –

170
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,745
they drink away all the wines of the world,

171
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:03,907
all the poisons of the world, like Shiva
did.

172
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:10,845
So when Sainath found that so many people
were smoking this tobacco,

173
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,935
he smoked all the tobacco of the world,

174
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:18,543
tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra
so that nobody should get it.

175
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:23,916
That’s the style of Shiva to take all
the poison into Himself,

176
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:28,457
and to absorb all the poison within
Himself.

177
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:31,406
He can deal with the most difficult things.

178
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:38,936
So the one dealing comes through the brain,
because Virata is in our brain,

179
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:43,380
acts through the brain. So He plays tricks
on you.

180
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:47,940
And that appeals to us because we can
see that He’s killed someone.

181
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:52,674
So we think, “Very nice Mother, You have
punished that person, it’s good.”

182
00:16:52,875 --> 00:17:00,128
But Shiva Tattwa gives you the problems
which normally you cannot see

183
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:06,705
but works out in a short time like that,
like heart troubles;

184
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:13,806
or a person who has a very poor Shiva
Tattwa

185
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:19,670
can have all the incurable diseases
of the world.

186
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:27,608
There nobody is killed, but it’s every
minute the person is suffering.

187
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,661
That is the way Shiva corrects.

188
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:39,265
In us, when Shiva Tattwa is awakened,
our priorities change absolutely.

189
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:46,215
I see now that those who have come,
say, to India from the West,

190
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,755
have changed quite a lot in their
priorities,

191
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:54,940
but still there is not so much change
as it should be.

192
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,213
They are, of course, thousand times better

193
00:17:57,414 --> 00:18:01,001
than their fellow beings who are not
realised souls.

194
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:07,570
But still, attachment to things, attachment
to money is quite a lot.

195
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,987
This detachment must work out.

196
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:17,750
See, things are not correct in people
and the alertness is not there.

197
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:21,399
To give a very, very gross example of this,
I’ll tell you

198
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,254
that, a gentleman, say, came and he was
told that,

199
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,152
“You have to give, say, eleven rupees
for puja.”

200
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:35,736
He said, “On principle we are not supposed
to give.”

201
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:39,703
So I mean, you are only paying, even
on principle,

202
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:45,429
you are only paying for your food and
lodging, not for puja.

203
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,472
The other side of it, they will not even
see that,

204
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:52,830
“Mother is spending so much for us extra
for which we are not paying anything.”

205
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,433
It’s not all found.

206
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:02,151
Like the other day, I said that people are
now asking me to pay for this,

207
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:06,056
then tomorrow they will say, “Pay for
our house rents.”

208
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:09,510
It was so. It was such a condition, once
upon a time in London,

209
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:13,108
when I started the ashram, that they asked
for all the utensils in the ashram,

210
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,573
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.
And ultimately, they said,

211
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:20,060
“We don’t have an ironing board, please
send us.”

212
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,123
From that, it’s not so bad now, I mean,
of course.

213
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,310
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees
for taxi,

214
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,506
they will think that, “Oh, we have to pay
for taxi, Mother is supposed to pay.”

215
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:38,833
But if I pay 7000-8000 rupees for you to go
to Haridwar, that’s all right.

216
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:44,350
that’s good, that nobody wants to find out
how Mother is paying for us.

217
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,729
It’s surprising and this disturbs me
very much

218
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:57,881
that what is your attitude towards
this now.

219
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:03,510
The pleasing should be done with full
heart.

220
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,865
Say if you have to buy any presents
for your friends, or anything,

221
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:12,664
you don’t mind spending money for that;
but for puja you have objections.

222
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:16,128
For your laundry you used to pay always,
I mean,

223
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:19,377
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed
how much money was spent.

224
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:25,539
But 21 rupees, the principle was involved.
Imagine.

225
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,550
Look at it. If you look at it, you will be
shocked at yourself.

226
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:36,133
But that shows despite all this, you have
got your realisation.

227
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,986
See the generosity.

228
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:44,586
It’s very, very, you see, it’s very,
very gross. It’s very gross.

229
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:51,689
So the detachment from this gross life
must go away.

230
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,442
But an ordinary villager understands better

231
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,003
because he is innocent. He is innocent.

232
00:20:57,204 --> 00:21:00,742
Because you are not innocent, that’s why
you see everything from your mind.

233
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,543
You think with it, “How much we paid,

234
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:07,547
how much this is, this is that, this,
that.”

235
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:12,791
But an innocent villager, even if he has
four annas,

236
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:17,954
he would like to do something, “Mother,
that’s all I have.”

237
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,564
We have a parable in the Bible.

238
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,649
And this is what it is. One should see

239
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,589
our detachment starts at a very baser
level of money.

240
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:38,939
You need not have any friends. What is
the need to give to any friends?

241
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,310
What are these friends for?

242
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,584
Except for Shiva Tattwa, what other friend
you need?

243
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:54,742
Think of it, without God, what is your
life?

244
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,907
So the detachment must start.
The priorities must change,

245
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:04,894
and you must know that God is the One
who is your Friend,

246
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:08,993
who is your Father, who is your Mother,
who is to be worshipped.

247
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:14,269
There is nothing else. Tana, mana, dhana –
everything is for God.

248
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,614
Of course, I don’t want anything from you,
you know that.

249
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:24,685
But that should be the attitude
of a person.

250
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:33,766
So the first – this attitude comes
in a person.

251
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:37,302
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great
advantage

252
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,947
that those who have developed this
attitude,

253
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:43,187
have been helped so much materially

254
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:48,695
that you find the proof of it, immediately.

255
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:53,668
The proof is there and those who do not
take to this kind of a thing, suffer.

256
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:56,927
So the proof is there.

257
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:08,715
I must give you an example of a goldsmith.

258
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,418
I had given him something to be made
for the puja.

259
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:15,215
A lot of gold was given, everything,

260
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:21,779
and still, stupidly, he tried to make money
out of that.

261
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:25,421
And he got cancer and he died.

262
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:29,733
I didn’t do anything, but I knew he had
made money.

263
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:33,051
I knew that all; I know lots of things.

264
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:38,984
I didn’t say anything to him, nothing,
never, never even mentioned.

265
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,785
He got cancer and he died; he is no more

266
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,196
because Shiva Tattva disappeared.
This was for a puja,

267
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:57,630
the money of the saints, something was
to be made

268
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:01,278
and he should not have done it. The proof
is just there.

269
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,782
Now, those who knew him got a fright
of their lives,

270
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:09,455
“Oh God, now no more of this from us
at least.”

271
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:17,972
But those who have been surrendered
about their money part also –

272
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:22,381
not that I take anything from you, nor
do I want anything from you –

273
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:25,799
but still, the attitude I am saying is
different.

274
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,022
Tthey have gone up, they have made money,
they are very rich,

275
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:31,161
they are very well to do, they are
all right,

276
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:35,490
they get so much blessings, everything.

277
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:40,151
This is the first Nabhi chakra’s
detachment.

278
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:44,792
We should start by putting Shiva on top.

279
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:52,006
Every attachment can be attacked with
Shiva Tattwa,

280
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:57,900
because Shiva Tattwa is brilliant like
a diamond, brilliant.

281
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:02,032
Every facet can be cleansed out, very
simply

282
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:06,568
through our Kundalini awakening and
through our alertness.

283
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:12,963
And one after that you can see there are
other attachments we have.

284
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:18,899
This is friendship, sympathies,
friendships.

285
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,112
Sympathies always go to a person who
is in need or something like that.

286
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:29,886
You have known sympathies have tortured
so many people.

287
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:33,812
The other way also could be that you hate
someone too much,

288
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,918
you love someone too much, some sort
of a thing like that.

289
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,796
So detachment comes that you do not hate,
nor you love anyone.

290
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:47,123
You leave it to God to decide.

291
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:54,627
That’s a kind of a detachment that
you leave it to God.

292
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:58,598
“God, please” – that is His exploit.
“I am not going to judge.

293
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,270
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini,
I awaken their Kundalini.

294
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:05,130
If it works out, well and good, if it
doesn’t work out, well and good.”

295
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:11,342
So you have detached yourself from
the responsibility of judging others.

296
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:15,521
Only your judgment is on Kundalini,
if it works out, all right.

297
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:21,208
But you are just like a barometer that’s
all, or like a machine that cures.

298
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,181
You are not involved into it. So this
involvement into personal lives

299
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:28,614
and personal relationships like mother,
sister, brother,

300
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:32,099
every sort of a nonsense, must be taken
out.

301
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,211
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

302
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:42,003
you must just get after her and see
that she is put right.

303
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:44,862
That’s very important; mother has
to be all right.

304
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,289
If she’s not all right, you tell her,
“I’m not going to eat

305
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,126
food from your hand, finished. You get
your vibrations all right.”

306
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:56,004
You tell her that, “You better take
to realisation,

307
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,150
otherwise I will not have anything to do
with you.

308
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,492
I’ll just come, see you, talk to you,
go away.”

309
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,639
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.
You must cure your mother.

310
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:13,112
Very important, because mother is a part
of Sahaja Yoga, it’s very important.

311
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:17,613
But many people I have seen just do not
know how to resist.

312
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:21,204
You must protest, go on protesting
one after another

313
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:26,303
because that’s the greatest thing you are
doing for your mother.

314
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:28,488
What else can you give it to her?

315
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,270
Anything you give, the whole world,
has no meaning,

316
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:41,854
except correcting your mother for the
better life, an eternal life, life of God.

317
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:50,147
Then your wife – the wife is a very
dangerous situation.

318
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:55,587
If the wife is negative, she will go on
putting into your head things,

319
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:59,695
which will work out at a odd time, and you
will be amazed

320
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:03,264
how you slipped out these things and how
you said these things,

321
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,028
why should you have done it, why did
you do this.

322
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:10,000
But the wife is to be told that, “You have
to behave yourself,

323
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:14,990
you have to get all right, nothing doing,
and there is no compromise.

324
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:17,109
You be in another room, I will be
in another room.

325
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,429
You should get well. I am not going
to have…”

326
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,507
Because that is even much more dangerous,
because you know

327
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,986
if the woman is catching,

328
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:33,670
then there are very serious diseases who
develop with the Mooladhara problem.

329
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:37,539
So you have to be strict with your wife.
You should make her,

330
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,016
you should say, “I’ll not eat any food
with your hands.

331
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,418
I’ll have nothing to do, I’ll not talk
to you,

332
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,292
I’ll just come and sleep in another room
and go out.

333
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:49,918
You better not touch my clothes.

334
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:54,937
If you don’t listen to me then I have
nothing to do with you.

335
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:58,368
You better… I’m your husband,

336
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,561
and whatever dharma I follow, you
have to follow,

337
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:03,955
if you don’t want to listen to me, then
I have nothing to do with you.”

338
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:06,950
The wife can also do the same thing
with the husband.

339
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:10,588
Gradually showing indifference in a way
that he understands

340
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:13,751
that it doesn’t bring love.

341
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,764
That’s how women corrected men
long time back.

342
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:22,470
Nowadays, of course women, if you give
them something, they are get pleased.

343
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,598
Even if there is a keep, as long as they
are giving diamonds to the wife,

344
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,722
she is quite pleased with the keep.
Still in India it’s not accepted.

345
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,058
But I have seen in the West nobody minds.

346
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:36,378
If the husband has ten keeps, doesn’t
matter,

347
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:41,304
as long as he is giving you the money,
all right, nobody minds it.

348
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:44,332
That’s very funny.

349
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:51,147
So wife’s relation, mother’s relations,
husband’s relations,

350
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:56,477
close relations must be corrected. And
children must be guarded.

351
00:29:56,678 --> 00:30:00,506
You shouldn’t allow your children to go
away to the wrong things.

352
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:03,030
If they are doing wrong things, they are
not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

353
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,347
you are duty bound;

354
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:07,213
you should say, “I’m not going to pay you
any money, nothing doing.

355
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:12,543
I’ll not see your faces, if you do not take
to Sahaja Yoga.”

356
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:18,297
What else are you going to give to your
children, but God?

357
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,622
You can do it. You all can do it.

358
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:35,153
But one should know I need not do it.

359
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:39,873
So many people say that, “Mother, Your
husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi.”

360
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:43,004
That’s all right. I know where to bring
him in;

361
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,419
I know when to bring my children in;

362
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,057
because if they were in, everybody would
have said,

363
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:53,349
“They have floated a family enterprise.”

364
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:05,672
As long as they are out of it, it’s a very
good idea, specially in India.

365
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:10,523
So best thing is if they oppose me, I keep
all of them out; my brothers…

366
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:14,696
Imagine, my own brothers, my own –

367
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:19,002
I mean, they all have tremendous respect
for me, no doubt.

368
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:22,744
Even my brother said that, “Thank God,
You are staying in my room now,

369
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:27,559
so the vibrations will be very good for me.
And what do You think of my vibrations?”

370
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,682
Everything he says, but he is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

371
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:33,153
I have given realisation to all of them,
everything is there,

372
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:35,528
but they are not Sahaja Yogis – a part
of this.

373
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:39,223
Otherwise they will be in charge of money,
you see.

374
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:41,202
“What money you get? Now, come along,

375
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:45,888
this is the money we have”, all
the problems.

376
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,621
With all these relations around, you don’t
know.

377
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:50,766
Somebody will go and say, “Shri Mataji
said so.”

378
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:54,950
“Oh, that’s the daughter of Mataji has
said” – so that becomes rule.

379
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,379
I don’t want all these pressures on my
head.

380
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,479
That’s the best way; I wish our politicians
understand that:

381
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:11,059
never have your relations around. That’s
the best way to administer.

382
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,855
If you have your relations around, then you
will never do right things.

383
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:21,918
Or even if you do right things, your
relations will spoil it.

384
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,231
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

385
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:29,043
that you should not try to help your
relations

386
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:34,028
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga.

387
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:37,164
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

388
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:42,350
you bring your mother and make her sit
in front of me.

389
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:51,283
First correct her vibrations. Put her right
and then bring her.

390
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:54,528
“Correct my father, correct my mother…”,

391
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:58,623
is not Mother’s responsibility, it’s your
own.

392
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:02,111
When they are all right, then as you bring
flowers to me,

393
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:09,365
bring your relations as a very good present
from your family.

394
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:15,117
That’s a much better thing than to be like
this that I have to clear.

395
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:19,590
If one is a Sahaja Yogi, all his three
generations up and down,

396
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,762
this side and that side I have to cure;
that is done.

397
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:28,458
Like Malhotra made me do.

398
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:33,558
So one should detach from these family ties

399
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,816
and these emotional imbalances we have,
emotional problems we have

400
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:46,571
by understanding that the only thing that
these people should have is Sahaja Yoga.

401
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,265
And some people should not be in Sahaja
Yoga.

402
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:57,110
Like as I said my own husband, and my
daughter and my relations, I keep them out.

403
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:01,349
All such people if there are any, you
should not also have them

404
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:07,174
anywhere near Sahaja Yoga. You should be
discrete to find out.

405
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:12,494
Although, all these, my relations are very
dharmic people, extremely dharmic,

406
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,345
very good, very self-respecting, all
qualities they have got –

407
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,285
everything, readymade, but they are not
in Sahaja Yoga.

408
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,176
So none of you can say, “Somebody said so,
so one said so.”

409
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:31,510
It has to be: “Mother has to say.”

410
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,818
This detachment has to come. It takes time,
especially with Indians.

411
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:41,795
All the time they are worried about their
children, or a mother or a father.

412
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,350
Go on and on and on and on and on,

413
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:51,741
see, years together, “my son, my daughter,
my son, my father” – all the time.

414
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:57,566
Now by God’s grace so many have got rid
of all their responsibilities somehow,

415
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:59,776
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is.

416
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:02,372
So they are now settled down onto
themselves,

417
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:05,051
because you are your own responsibility.

418
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:09,499
So this detachment must be brought, those
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

419
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,030
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga
blessings. We are going to be blessings.

420
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,609
With that pride if you’ll be in the family,

421
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,330
“All right, if you want to have Sahaja
Yoga, you have it”,

422
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:24,262
but not to force them on Sahaja Yoga.

423
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:26,299
But you can force Sahaja Yoga on them;

424
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,854
the stage has come that you have to talk
about Sahaja Yoga to them.

425
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:31,349
In the beginning I used to say, “Don’t talk
to them.”

426
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,340
But those who are useless, if they are not
to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

427
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,162
tell them, “You are not good for Sahaja
Yoga, better not ask me.”

428
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:41,485
Then they will come. Some people you should
show complete indifference,

429
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:44,036
“You are incapable, you are no good, you
are too materialistic.”

430
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:48,574
Then that person will say, “I will prove
that I am.”

431
00:35:56,926 --> 00:36:00,926
All these detachments take place

432
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:06,350
and then the detachments are at Nabhi
chakras,

433
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:10,152
you rise up to your emotional side at
the Heart chakra.

434
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:17,597
And then you have to have the detachment
even of a kind of a collectivity,

435
00:36:17,798 --> 00:36:21,600
that we think it’s collectivity.

436
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:28,575
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not
collectivity.

437
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:35,196
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will
form a group;

438
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:46,665
and they’ll have a very strong objection
to everything that is sensible,

439
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:49,391
and they will have suggestions for
everything.

440
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:56,106
There has to be no suggestions at all.

441
00:36:56,307 --> 00:37:01,596
There are no alternatives because Shiva
is absolute.

442
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:08,014
Once one said is said. You just do it and
see – that’s the best.

443
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:14,571
Alternatives will be second best or third
best or maybe useless.

444
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:19,270
But there is no alternative for Shiva
Tattwa.

445
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:27,493
I’ll give an example, I told Delhi people
that, “You organise, say,

446
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:31,799
programme for seven days outside,
with other people.”

447
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,439
It was sensible because I knew it was
to rain. And it has to rain also.

448
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,823
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain
for all the other villagers, you see.

449
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,827
We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis,
can we?

450
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,758
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important,
so I said,

451
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,611
“Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis.”

452
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:51,318
Now they started an alternative, only
thinking that

453
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,298
you see, they won’t be comfortable and…

454
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:57,929
I mean it was good, but on a other level,

455
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,948
that they will not be comfortable with
Sahaja Yogis, another level.

456
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,525
But there has to be understanding if Mother
has said it,

457
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:06,645
it must be done, whatever it is.

458
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:10,228
Even if She says, “You kill somebody”,
you have to kill.

459
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:17,054
Keep it like that, to that extent. Keep
to the maximum.

460
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:22,465
Even if She says, “You have to die now”,
you should die.

461
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:31,202
If She says, “All right, you tell lies”,
“All right, I’ll tell lies.”

462
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:34,858
Like Radhaji, She said, “What is my punyas,
what is my papas?

463
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:39,893
I am in His heart. What can I do?”
Whatever He does, She just does.

464
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,897
That is Shiva Tattwa.

465
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:48,548
When it is awakened, you see, it at least
recognises this Shiva in me.

466
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:53,065
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattwa.

467
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:55,839
It understands because at Shiva Tattwa

468
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:01,500
you don’t commit any sins, you are sinless.

469
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:07,137
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless;
there is no sin in you.

470
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:11,126
If, supposing according to human
understanding,

471
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,978
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then
it’s sinful.

472
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,757
Why to leave anybody? It’s sinful,
isn’t it?

473
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:20,095
For all common purposes, common
understanding, we’ll think

474
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:26,023
that it is sinful for Shiva to leave
the person and make the person die.

475
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:29,931
For example, a lady dies, her children
are left behind,

476
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:34,802
then one can blame Shiva for that, that,
“See now, You went away, and these children

477
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:40,251
are now without a mother or without
a father”, something like that.

478
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:45,257
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does
is sinless.

479
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:49,866
So whatever you do is sinless. The idea
of sin is finished

480
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:57,397
because who commits sin is your ego.
Ego commits sin.

481
00:39:57,598 --> 00:40:00,680
But if you have no ego, there’s no sin,

482
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:06,523
because you are not doing anything,
you stand in akarma.

483
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:09,871
Say the sun is shining, is shining sharp,

484
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:14,446
and somebody wants to stand in the sun,
then he gets burns.

485
00:40:14,647 --> 00:40:19,491
It’s not the fault of the sun, the sun
is shining,

486
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:23,646
that’s the job of sun.

487
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:27,557
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is
doing it. He is not sinful.

488
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:32,013
It’s our mental attitude makes us think,
“This is sin”, “this is not sin”.

489
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:35,986
But when we have ego, we are committing
sins.

490
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:41,626
If you ask a tiger, “You are committing
a sin because you are eating a cow.”

491
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:47,736
He will say, “I never knew what a sin was.
I don’t know what sin is.”

492
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:52,503
It’s a story when some missionaries were
going away from a village, you see.

493
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:56,412
So the villagers, poor, innocent you know,
they just got up to thank them.

494
00:40:56,613 --> 00:41:00,011
They said, “Thank God, when you came here,
you told us there is sin.

495
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:03,564
We didn’t know what sin was.”

496
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:09,059
For innocent people, they don’t know what
is sin.

497
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,008
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

498
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:17,268
It obeys the other source of innocence.

499
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:20,653
So there is no sin for a person who is
the Spirit.

500
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,924
For Shiva there is no sin, whether He wants
to give

501
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:29,015
His blessings to a rakshasa or to a saint.

502
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:34,602
There is no sin for Him, because He
is Bholenath.

503
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:38,185
He is beyond, He is beyond sin.

504
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,958
Whatever He does, He is beyond sin,

505
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,153
because ego cannot envelope Him.
There is no ego.

506
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:50,707
Because we have ego, we commit sins.

507
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:57,188
Once ego is finished, we are no more there,
so who commits sins?

508
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,794
When we are not there, who is committing
the sin?

509
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:06,110
Shiva can’t commit sins, so we are
the Shiva, so we cannot commit sins.

510
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,550
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

511
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:12,888
at the mental level, is also wrong.

512
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,439
I give any – anything I say, immediately
there will be ten suggestions.

513
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,395
I try all these tricks with you,

514
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:24,903
because you are used to conferences,
you see.

515
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:33,537
So I said, “All right, Subramanian, what
do you have to say about it?”

516
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:39,621
Because after all, lord Subramanian
is there, must ask him.

517
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:47,627
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I’ll ask
Gavin, Warren, all these people,

518
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:53,392
“Now, what do you have to say?” And
then they give their suggestions.

519
00:42:53,593 --> 00:43:05,573
But if you see, in the conference of all
the divine Deities,

520
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:11,242
there is no suggestion, no suggestion,
no alternative.

521
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:14,921
No alternatives to your Mother’s ideas,
nothing.

522
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:17,821
Absolute, it’s absolute.

523
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:23,040
Nobody gives any suggestions to me,
never.

524
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:27,691
No question.

525
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:33,202
They won’t listen to you, they won’t listen
to anyone.

526
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:39,291
There’s no question. Such harmony;
complete obedience.

527
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:45,733
And not only they are fixed with their
qualities.

528
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:50,204
If they are told that, “You have to do it”,
they’ll do it.

529
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:57,298
This is the difference. Then try.

530
00:43:57,515 --> 00:44:00,741
Sometimes it appears, you see –
if I say, “All right,

531
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:05,586
go this way and you will find the place”,
but you won’t find.

532
00:44:05,787 --> 00:44:08,110
So you will say, “See, Mother, You said
to go this way,

533
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:10,863
that’s why we went this way and we didn’t
find the church.”

534
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:14,614
Now there it is not that I’m saying that
you will find the church,

535
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:20,102
it is I am trying to see what you think.

536
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:24,976
I am telling you my own tricks, all right,
so be careful.

537
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:30,559
I’ll tell you although, “Go this way. Now,
you didn’t find the church, I’m sorry.

538
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,454
I should not have told you. Or you should
have gone that (way).”

539
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:36,350
But that’s not true. I must tell you,
that’s not true.

540
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:40,831
What I am trying to see, what you are
saying about this.

541
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:45,112
Now if you are clever, you would say,
“I went there,

542
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:49,428
I didn’t see the place, but I saw something
else, Mother.

543
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:52,608
That’s the reason You sent me there. Now
I know why You sent me there.”

544
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:57,183
That’s it. Then I know that he is Sahaja
Yogi.

545
00:44:57,421 --> 00:45:01,822
But if you say, “Oh, I went there because
I thought I will find this thing,

546
00:45:02,023 --> 00:45:06,405
but, it was not there, and You sent me,
You sent me”, finished.

547
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:10,926
If you say that, “You said so and it
happened.”

548
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:16,265
Oh, I did say, no doubt, but what I said
was just to play a trick on you,

549
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:20,976
because one of the natures of your Mother
is Mahamaya. So be careful.

550
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,326
How you react is very important for me
to see how far you have gone.

551
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:29,470
This is one of the ways you are judged.

552
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:34,617
But for a villager, it’s a different thing
if you see.

553
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:41,045
If I tell him, “Now if you want me to go
to that village,

554
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:48,306
see, take the cart, or take the bullock
cart this way”, he’ll take it.

555
00:45:48,507 --> 00:45:52,962
But there will be a ditch, so I’ll get hit.

556
00:45:53,163 --> 00:46:00,427
So he will say, “Mother, I’m sorry, you
got hit. But I could have avoided it.”

557
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:03,283
You see, so he takes the responsibility
upon himself.

558
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:05,977
He takes everything upon himself.
“Because you asked me,

559
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:12,246
so I had to go that way, but I could have
avoided it if I was careful.”

560
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:15,702
So this is the difference you know, not
to put responsibility.

561
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:19,260
It’s a common human nature is to put
responsibility on somebody else.

562
00:46:19,461 --> 00:46:21,770
Best is to put on Mother.

563
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:28,510
But in that you lose all your punyas.

564
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:34,134
So, “The responsibility is mine. I must
have done some mistake.

565
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:37,217
I must have done some mistake somewhere

566
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:42,492
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn
something in this.”

567
00:46:42,693 --> 00:46:46,273
Every time you do something, I tell you
something,

568
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:50,040
it’s just for you to learn something.
I don’t have to learn anything.

569
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:55,258
Do you think that way, that I have to learn
something now anymore? Not anymore.

570
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:59,230
So you have to learn something. And that
is what if you understand,

571
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:03,944
then a kind of a detachment will build
in you and a surrender.

572
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:08,172
You will be amazed that you will be
so much relieved

573
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:14,320
of nonsensical headaches that you have
and the burdens you carry.

574
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:21,095
If you understand that, “The whole joke,
the whole work,

575
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:26,565
the whole drama is done by Mother and
I am just playing into it.”

576
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:33,943
It’s so simple. That is to be felt, to be
understood.

577
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:37,089
And the enjoyment lies in that,

578
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,181
not in judging or finding alternatives.

579
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:46,694
You try it. Those who have tried it have
enjoyed it very much and so many things.

580
00:47:46,895 --> 00:47:50,118
Every minute, I'll give you an example
of that.

581
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,916
I’ll give you an example of Gregoire last
time I went to his house.

582
00:47:54,117 --> 00:47:56,689
He tortured my life for his wife.

583
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,486
“When will she have her delivery?
How will she have,

584
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:03,300
who is going to stay with her?” Morning
till evening, he had one talk.

585
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,763
“All right”, I said, “something will be
done.

586
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:08,765
You can have this lady to stay...”
“But then how will I go to India?”

587
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:11,895
I mean, “I” was so important.

588
00:48:12,096 --> 00:48:14,306
Then he didn’t realise that time, you see.

589
00:48:14,507 --> 00:48:17,749
He thought it was so important to do
that way.

590
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,065
Ultimately quite before going, I told him,

591
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:23,758
“Gregoire, you troubled me too much this
time, but it’s all right.”

592
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:26,077
So he said, “I’m sorry.”

593
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:31,310
Then he telephoned me one day saying,
“Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

594
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,381
She has gone to the hospital, there is
no chance.” I said, “Forget it.

595
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:38,003
You go back to the hospital, she will be
all right.”

596
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:41,150
So he went to the hospital, they said,
“A miracle.

597
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,647
She’s perfectly all right, there’s no
problem. She’s all right.”

598
00:48:46,848 --> 00:48:49,174
So it came into his head, as he told me,

599
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:52,486
“Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should
I worry?

600
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:55,529
Why should I have worried Her?”
This is first thing.

601
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:03,343
Then, the child was born earlier than time
and he came to India.

602
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:08,526
So also I convince you that what I say,
what I do,

603
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:11,872
you know that, that I look after you.

604
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:16,782
But when you take up responsibility upon
yourself and start thinking about it,

605
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:22,827
then I cannot help. So just know that,
leave it to God.

606
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:25,848
It’s all for your good, for your ‘hita’.

607
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,373
Everything is for your ‘hita’, whatever
it is.

608
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:32,863
Sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes
I have to correct you,

609
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:35,629
sometimes I have to tell you that,
“Don’t come here.”

610
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,879
Some people who touch me, you see, can
give me horrible sensations.

611
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,596
Then I say, “You just don’t come here.
You don’t stand before me,

612
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:45,169
you get out from here.” That helps them.

613
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,513
But if they stand there, the bhoots will
never leave

614
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:51,455
because the bhoots want to trouble me.

615
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:56,126
So this point if you understand, you will
get completely detached

616
00:49:56,327 --> 00:50:00,019
and we’ll know that for our good, for our
betterment

617
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:05,072
we must keep Mother pleased and these
things if we do, by displeasing Her,

618
00:50:05,273 --> 00:50:07,995
we are going to be finished.

619
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:12,977
Now to understand this, what you need –
not age, not position,

620
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:21,660
not your qualifications, nothing – you need
a wise mind, deep personality.

621
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:25,521
I’ve seen very young people are so sensible
though their parents are stupid,

622
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,350
absolutely stupid people.

623
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:31,679
So you just need a wise, deep personality
to do it

624
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,919
and that you should try to develop.

625
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,069
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattwa,
which is a solid thing,

626
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:45,034
which is Shiva, Achala which doesn’t
move, absolute.

627
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:47,870
It is not relative, it’s not relative
at all,

628
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:53,114
it’s not related to anything, absolute.
That gives you the depth,

629
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:59,192
that depth which is required to settle
down, to go deep into you.

630
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:03,816
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that
gives you the gravity

631
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:08,576
to go straight down deep into it.

632
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:12,270
[Aside: Marathi]

633
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:26,219
That is very important. And all this I hope

634
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:34,176
with the puja today we’ll try to settle you

635
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:38,830
into that great principle of Shiva.

636
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:43,827
Let your attention, every particle of your
attention be filled,

637
00:51:44,028 --> 00:51:58,133
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing
of Shiva Tattva.

638
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,045
I bless you all. May God bless you.

639
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,956
So to begin with, we are going to worship
the Devi first of all,

640
00:52:13,157 --> 00:52:16,170
and then the Shiva.

641
00:52:16,411 --> 00:52:19,737
[Aside: Hindi for some minutes]

642
00:56:16,846 --> 00:56:19,966
So first we will have Ganesha’s Avahanam,

643
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:24,255
means we have to establish Shri Ganesha,
that is important.

644
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:31,555
And then, after that we have to say
the names of Vishnu, whatever –

645
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:38,119
because His names are to be said which
are the ascending names.

646
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:46,517
And after that we will be having
the location and everything described

647
00:56:46,718 --> 00:56:50,820
where we are doing it, why we are
doing it, the puja.

648
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:56,366
Then we’ll worship Devi. We take 108 names
of the Devi.

649
00:56:56,567 --> 00:57:00,131
I think you all should remember these
108 names by heart.

650
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:04,390
Have you got printed Devi’s names?

651
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:08,126
Gavin, have you got copies?

652
00:57:10,246 --> 00:57:12,175
You have got them?

653
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:16,158
Have you got these with you? Do you
have booklets?

654
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:19,843
Yogi: No, Mother.
Shri Mataji: (Hindi) Only one.
