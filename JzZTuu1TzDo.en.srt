1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:13,230
It’s nice to come back to America....now 
there are lots of seekers in this country;

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,230
lost.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,330
They are frantically seeking, no doubt.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,650
The are genuine seekers,...ave no doubt about 
it....ame back after...ears; it was unfortunate

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,710
because...as busy with other parts of the 
world and...new I’d find them again when...ame

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,710
back.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:41,720
It is for us to know first of all that if 
you are seeking reality, if you are seeking

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:51,290
the truth, we have to be very honest about 
it; extremely honest.

9
00:00:51,290 --> 00:01:02,410
You have to know that unless and until you 
find it, you should not believe anyone., You

10
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,020
should nbot accept any surface anything.

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:16,619
People may say anything....ay tell you that 
you have to have your realization.

12
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:28,039
That doesn’t mean that you have to believe 
me...t doesn’t mean that at all.

13
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:33,749
But you should not also deny me.

14
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:43,810
Now, first of all we should know what we are 
seeking.

15
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:53,630
There has been never on this earth such an 
urge to seek.

16
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,930
So many seekers!...on’t know if you understand 
that...eally different type of category of

17
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,930
people...

18
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,100
call them men of God...re born who are seekers.

19
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:14,560
And they will go on seeking until they find 
the truth.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,740
But one has to know what we are seeking.

21
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,860
What are we to seek?

22
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,190
It is said you have to become.

23
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,490
You have to be.

24
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,440
What do we have to be?

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,200
We have to be our Spirit.

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Now we do not know what our Spirit is.

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,010
The Spirit exists, no doubt.

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,460
It watches us.

29
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,370
We know there is...pirit.

30
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:13,570
But how to bring that Spirit into our conscious 
mind...nto our central nervous system...s

31
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,590
the point.

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:31,960
And when people know that there are such demands, 
the market also gets filled with enterprise...s

33
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,630
very common.

34
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:42,280
Americans have the worst hit because you have 
worse...ou have money.

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,730
That is the worst part of it.

36
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:55,520
And that’s how all of them are different 
down here and they have exploited you.

37
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,290
I’m sorry for all that.

38
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,830
But...ust tell you that you cannot pay for 
your realization.

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,600
It’s an insult of God.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,620
How can you pay?

41
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,900
How can you p[ay for His love?

42
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,680
Do you pay to...ree when it gives you fruit?

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,259
You do not.

44
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,509
Maybe...erchant might take...ruit and settle.

45
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,129
It’s much more than that.

46
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,270
“How can we pay for it?”

47
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,939
Is...imple question we should ask ourselves; 
honestly.

48
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:50,550
Then second point is, you cannot have courses 
in God realization.

49
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,800
What university did Christ go?

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,939
He was...imple man.

51
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:05,240
Did he go to any university?

52
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,810
There is no understanding for us.

53
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,219
That God is for everyone, whether you are 
rich people or not.

54
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,410
Whether you understand this language or that 
language, God’s language is of love and

55
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,509
it’s for everyone…

56
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:18,990
every person….for every case.

57
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:27,129
It cannot be for one person or one type of 
people or of one category.

58
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:33,480
But one category is there and they are the 
seekers.

59
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:43,650
Seekers is...pecial category; but only trouble 
is they do not know what they are seeking.

60
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:51,749
For this we have to divert to some authentic 
people.

61
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:55,180
For example, we should see now Christ.

62
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,199
Christ said that you are to be born again.

63
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,900
Last time, when...ame to America, they were 
taping my speeches and all that in Los Angeles.

64
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:17,020
And...as amazed, you see, that poeple objected 
to it; felt they should not tape....aid, “Let

65
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,550
them tape.

66
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,610
What does it matter?”

67
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,729
They said, “No Mother, they will publish 
it."

68
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,559
...aid, “Let them publish it.

69
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,559
It’s...act.

70
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,599
They should get it.

71
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,680
They should get their relization.

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,009
They are to be born again."

73
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,009
But...as amazed!

74
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:54,490
Then, they write books as if that was their 
knowledge....on’t mind that either.

75
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:11,259
But saying that you are to be born again and 
they got...ertificate...

76
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,059
sales certificate...hat we are born again.

77
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,210
How can you certify yourslf you are born again?

78
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,660
You have to be honest about it.

79
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:29,069
If you are born again something special has 
to happen to us.

80
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,939
Like Jung has said that you have to become...ecome 
collectively conscious.

81
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:36,839
Not that...ay we are all brothers and sisters 
and we are all one.

82
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,610
No, you have to become that part and parcel 
of the whole...s you say the microcosm.

83
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,520
You have to become this microcosm...as to 
become that.

84
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,650
That means in evolution, your awareness has 
to become something more.

85
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,900
As an animal you see, for example, for an 
animal.

86
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,750
He doesn’t see any colors.

87
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,259
He doesn’t see whether is filthy or good.

88
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,099
But you do.

89
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:20,020
I’m the same way, if you have to rise higher, 
the change has to come in your awareness.

90
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:28,819
That is one thing one should know...hat the 
transformation has to take place in your awareness.

91
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,260
And that is what one should see.

92
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,639
Is there any transformation in awareness?

93
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:44,610
For example, there is some lady who starts 
jumping on the seat.

94
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,339
I’ve seen some poeple who come to me.

95
00:08:48,339 --> 00:09:02,250
They just start jumping and they think they 
have got realization.

96
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,370
How can that be?

97
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:14,570
You are not in possession of yourself.

98
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,100
You have to be your own master.

99
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:29,990
Here somebody is making you jump.

100
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:38,480
Maybe you are possessed.You have not have 
authority over yourself.

101
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,350
You do not know how to control yourself.

102
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,440
And how do you say that you have got realization?

103
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,590
If you become self realized, you are not going 
to be enslaved.

104
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,290
You are going to get over all

105
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,550
kinds of slavery.

106
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,930
You have to be...aster.

107
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:10,569
This should be the test of anything that you 
are seeking.

108
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:16,720
What have you got, you say?

109
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,130
Are you emitting your own powers?...ay say 
(as he has said it,...ean,...on’t know why

110
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,680
Warren said this because...eldom start with 
this kind of...hing); but if you wanted to

111
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,069
see who said it.

112
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:41,270
Now to say that...m such and such and such 
and such is nonsense....ay be anything.

113
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,930
So what?

114
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,720
What did you get is the point!

115
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,370
Did you feel yourself any more than before?

116
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,079
Did you get anthing more than you have had 
before?

117
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,449
Not that you become crazy people or recluses.

118
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,709
That’s not the way.

119
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:14,430
You are going to become most normal person...as 
to be extremely normal.

120
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,360
And above all, you have to have complete control 
of yourself.

121
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,319
That is the minimum of minimums one should 
know.

122
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:34,899
But our idea about self realization is so 
much spoiled and so many psuedo people have

123
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:41,390
written., even about Kundalini....as amazed 
when...ound out that such big, big books are

124
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,390
written about Kundalini....

125
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:49,670
saying it is in the stomache, some say it 
is in the nose....

126
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,629
it is here and there.

127
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,100
It is not there!

128
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,399
It is in the sacrum bone.

129
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
You can see it yourself with your own eyes.

130
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,670
When the Kundalini rises you can see the pulsation 
just like...eart....

131
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,070
not in everyone, of course.

132
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:24,480
But in some poeple who have had an obstruction, 
you can see with your naked eyes.

133
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:35,240
You should be able to see it...appily...nd 
you can also feel the pulsation coming to

134
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,699
the head....ean so many pleople have said 
it.

135
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:50,399
There are people now,...m told, who are converting 
people into Shikhism and this and that.

136
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,600
And what is Shikhism?

137
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,440
If you need...ead Kabir (sp ?) who is the 
basis of Shikhism.

138
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:10,250
He has said that you have to feel the cool 
breeze coming out of your head.

139
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,250
He says...

140
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,470
(Mother quotes in another language).

141
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:22,830
This means, on the head first of all, there 
is the sound of Anahada, is this thub-dub

142
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:29,589
of the heart and then you feel the cool breeze 
coming out.

143
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:35,520
Is so clearly said, but who reads those people?

144
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,019
Those people who talk even of Hinduism and 
all that, do they read Adi Shankaracharia?

145
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,060
What Adi Shankaracharin has said?

146
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:54,839
He has written books after books on Kundalini; 
and not only, but on this Chaintanyita (sp?)

147
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,449
he has written...omplete book.

148
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,329
But people don’t read that.

149
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,610
You get these...

150
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:07,879
don’t know...xtracts and some sort of...on’t 
know how they are not afraid of God?

151
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,629
They are not afraid...ust to make some money...

152
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,079
don’t know.

153
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:22,930
Are they going to carry this money with them?

154
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,329
It’s very, very wrong!

155
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:36,120
It’s very sinful....on’t mind what ever 
they do.

156
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:47,110
It’s alright if they want to be smugglers 
and all.

157
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,610
There are many like that.

158
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,110
But they spoil your Kundalini.

159
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,319
You are damaged.

160
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:03,490
And this is the thing which...m concernd about.

161
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,000
It’s...ery sad thing.

162
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,910
Coming to America is...eal _____?

163
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,959
for me because...id send some of the people 
who were really realized sould and they came

164
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:16,959
here.

165
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,870
They ran away within...ays.

166
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,110
They said they will never recognize us...here 
is...arrier...here is...arrier.

167
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,020
They will never recognize Mother.

168
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,760
They rushed back.

169
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,720
They stayed in New York, one of them stayed.

170
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,610
He ran away.

171
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,139
He couldn’t stand it.

172
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:42,570
He said, “They just want something else.

173
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,089
They don’t want Ìod.

174
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,260
They don’t want their spirit."

175
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,899
Of course,...on’t believe that.

176
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:59,129
These barriers are created to us because we 
read about it.

177
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,620
We try to understand through reading.

178
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:14,339
It’s good, but you must come to...ight conclusion 
through logical, logical understanding; not

179
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,339
rationality.

180
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:21,490
Rationality is something which can take you 
anywhere.

181
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,120
Rationality can give you...you can) rationalize 
even...urder...nything!

182
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,329
But, logically, you must understnd.

183
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:35,480
Where should we reach?

184
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,649
What should happen to us?

185
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,420
As seekers, what are we expecting?

186
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,639
This is...ery, very precarious and important 
time...s more to say.

187
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,600
The Last Judgement has started.

188
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,769
That has started.

189
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:02,339
That’s how you are all here and you are 
seeking.

190
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:09,339
The way it will judge, is the Kundalini has 
to rise.

191
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,640
Your have to become self realized.

192
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,179
Then you start feeling your centers on your 
fingers.

193
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:27,110
Tomorrow...ill give you all the information 
about the centers and all that and...ill tell

194
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,070
you how He will judge you.

195
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,690
What are your centers that are catching?

196
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:47,200
And then you will judge that and you will 
know what is the problem....

197
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,230
how to get it done...ow to get it alright.

198
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,270
There is no technique for _____?...ike if 
you sow...eed it becomes...ree.

199
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,299
There is no technique.

200
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,350
If you have flowers, they become...ruit.

201
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,620
It’s...iving thing.

202
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,070
And living things don’t have any technique.

203
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:19,120
But once you get connected, then you must 
know the Divine laws and you must know the

204
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,360
Divine technique.

205
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,080
But first you must be realized.

206
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,350
Unless and until you are put to the Mains, 
how can you use this machine¿ You are not

207
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,100
yet put to the Mains.

208
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
How can you do anything?

209
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,270
It’s like telephoning somewhere without 
having connection.

210
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:51,170
You must be connected., first of all to the 
Divine.( but this is not...ifficult thing.).

211
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,640
In modern times is very easy.

212
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,900
Formerly, it was, like you can say,...ree.

213
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,770
In the beginning you get only one or two flowers.

214
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,799
But the time has come.

215
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,179
The blossom time has come.

216
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,850
Already today,...ent to see William Blake’s 
drawing exhibition.

217
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,410
And he said, “All your sins and blasphemy 
and everything will be forgiven.

218
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,700
All your sins will be forgiven."

219
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,320
He has said about these days.

220
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:38,520
He said that the God of _____?

221
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:53,210
will become prophets and they will have power 
to convert and transform others into prophets.

222
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,110
He has clearly prophesized about Sahaja Yoga.

223
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,010
Every word he has said about it.

224
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,800
But people don’t read Blake.

225
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
If you go

226
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,280
and see his exhibition, you’ll be surprised 
how in the “Pilgrim’s Progress” only

227
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,370
he has given clearly how you face life.

228
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:25,740
And there are some Sahjaja Yogis here sitting 
down at your back here.

229
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,649
And they have come from London and some of 
them from Australia.

230
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:31,649
And they could see.

231
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,510
This is how you face it.

232
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:40,670
But to get realization is the easiest thing; 
to maintain it...ather difficult.

233
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,900
But also that is possible.

234
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:56,260
Now we have in London (you will be surprised)...all 
at least one and one-half times bigger than

235
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,410
this.

236
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,560
And the hall was completely filled.

237
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,240
And they rose up to sing...ong of Jeruseleum 
which was...reat experience for me to see

238
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
that.

239
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,800
But( you won’t believe)...tarted the work 
in England because my husband got elected

240
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,150
to...ost there.

241
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,510
That’s how we were there.

242
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,560
And in the beginning,...as working with seven 
people...even hippies,...hould say...even

243
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,250
people for four years.

244
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:36,330
And now of course, in the whole of England 
we have many centers and lots of people have

245
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,350
got realization and they are working it out.

246
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,510
It’s working out very well.

247
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,830
We have some people here from there who have 
come.

248
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,830
Dr.

249
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,890
David is here and Hesta is...arrister.

250
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,280
Then we have these two from Australia...r.

251
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,210
Warren, who was...iplomat.

252
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,610
And these two are American girls...oth of 
them...h Christine...as been with me since

253
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:17,750
long and Marcia who got her realization only 
two months back, but she was so upright and

254
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,120
so straight forward.

255
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,020
And you should know that it is you who should 
decide.

256
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,010
If you say...m your Guru, alright...ccept 
it for the time being.

257
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:36,539
But...other is always...uru.

258
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:51,400
If you say that your mother had to teach you 
so many things...lso...ave to teach you some

259
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
things.

260
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:01,840
But actually, it is you who is your own guru.

261
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,429
You have to become it.

262
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:09,200
Unless and until you are connected, how will 
you judge?

263
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,980
Once you get connected, you will be able to 
check.

264
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:24,750
But you don’t think it is...ental activity 
that is going to bring you your realization.

265
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,860
No, God has placed everything beautifully 
within us...verything.

266
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:39,399
You have got your Kundalini very nicely placed 
in the sacrum bone.

267
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,700
Now, see this bone.

268
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,529
Sacrum is...riangular bone called “sacrum” 
so that Greeks know about this bone.

269
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,850
They knew it was...acred bone.

270
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,100
Sacrum means sacred in Greek.

271
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,899
When...ent to Greece,...as surprised.

272
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,950
They have the complete idea of kundalini; 
complete idea.

273
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,470
And they have this Athena also...eans the 
Primordial Mother.

274
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:13,850
In Sanskrit language, Athena...thens comes 
from that and the way She was holding...erpent

275
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:24,240
in her hand and everything...bsolutely She 
is the Primordial Kundalini.

276
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:37,190
And the whole concept was there and when...ent 
into the study of that...ried to find out

277
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,990
what it was....

278
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,399
how did they know?

279
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:49,390
They said we had some Indo-Aryian groups coming 
down here and they told us these things and

280
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,760
that’s how they know about it.

281
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,240
But, that was all lost

282
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:03,200
because they brought all the Gods to the level 
of human beings and made alot of mess out

283
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,230
of it.

284
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:11,960
Now we have to know that how Christ was such 
an important incarnation on this earth.

285
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,420
We have really made...ess of the whole thing.

286
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,640
He said that you are to be born again.

287
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,299
Actually, he came on this center where you 
see this red mark.

288
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,670
You see...t is placed in the optic chiasma.

289
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,510
In the center is...ubtle center called as 
Agnya chakra.

290
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,040
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu.

291
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,010
But...ill tell about His advent when He came 
on this earth.

292
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,430
We say, He is the gate; he is the door.

293
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:59,980
He is the door below the limbic area.

294
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:06,450
And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God.

295
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,680
Where one has to center, the attention has 
to enter.

296
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,170
How you enter into it...ot bodily, but your 
attention has to enter it.

297
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,910
Your attention is apread out in this area.

298
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:32,000
But not there...t has to enter through that 
area into the limbic area and ultimately,

299
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,429
is the fontanel area.

300
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:48,510
It becomes soft and the kundalini has to come 
out and with the cool breeze, this is your

301
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,059
actual baptism.

302
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:58,010
Is not the baptism you go to some theological 
college to learn and say alright...

303
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,159
baptize...t’s all artifical.

304
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,320
It’s absolutely artificial.

305
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:12,760
That’s not the way you can baptize.

306
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,110
You have to be...ealized soul to do that.

307
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,770
John the Baptist was...ealized soul.

308
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:26,990
He was the one who knew how to do it.

309
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,399
And he did it for all of them.

310
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,450
And that’s how it should happen to you.

311
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,540
The kundalini has to rise and give you realization.

312
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,210
Now the Christ advent came at this point.

313
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:48,110
It’s...ery important one because today we 
have brought the charts and all that but tomorrow

314
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,789
we’ll be giving you, in...ull way, how the 
ego and super-ego are sucked.

315
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,320
They create...arrier here.

316
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,990
Our ego and super-ego gives us our I-ness.

317
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,769
We get seperated.

318
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:10,730
When He’s awakened, this portion gets opened 
out and then the kundalini can rise.

319
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,830
That’s why it is said, Christ is to be awakened 
within you.

320
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:21,190
But it can be only done by...erson with Divine 
authority.

321
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,549
And such...erson cannot live on your money.

322
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,549
He cannot be...arasite.

323
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,160
Such...erson has nothing to do wioth money.

324
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,409
How can you purchase such...erson.?

325
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,639
Such...erson is beyond....

326
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:33,370
beyond your purchase...eyond your money.

327
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,830
You cannot do anything for such...erson.

328
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,850
Such...erson just gives.

329
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,870
He just gives.

330
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,870
He emits.

331
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,910
It cannot take anything.

332
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,910
It cannot receive.

333
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,309
It cannot!

334
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,549
You may try, but doesn’t.

335
00:28:51,549 --> 00:29:01,250
One day...as walking...ittle bit, my foot 
was...ittle twisted and one of the doctors

336
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:10,159
she said, “Alright Mother, I’ll try to 
massage it."

337
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:20,549
Yet she was relaxing that side and...as saying, 
“What’s happening to you?”

338
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:23,070
She said, “Mother, what is this?

339
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:31,049
Lots of vibrations are coming and...m just 
massaging yourself and...m massaging myself....

340
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:40,139
the way it is cooling down and soothing."

341
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:45,279
So, such...erson cannot take anythging from 
you.

342
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:52,809
Now, the most important point which...ould 
like to reach you is this: that we don’t

343
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,080
realize hos precariously we are placed otherwise, 
also.

344
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,139
There are equal and opposite forces working 
on us.

345
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:11,590
For example,...isease like cancer....as surprised 
to hear at this country, theere are patients...ne

346
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:18,970
among four...f cancer disease....ave told 
this ten years back, that cancer can only

347
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,899
be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:37,720
There’s no other way out....ave cured many 
cancer patients and you can also cure once

349
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
you get realized.

350
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,269
How it happens...ow you cure cancer...ll this 
knowledte you can have...ree of charge.

351
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,940
Free of this thing.

352
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,820
Actually, first you must get your realization.

353
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:59,159
Without that, there is no use telling you 
because you come into this room; it is all

354
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,669
dark; you are blind; you cannot see anything.

355
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:13,669
What’s the use telling you the size of the 
room, and color of the chairs, and color of

356
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,179
all this?

357
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,210
No use telling you.

358
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:26,990
Best thing is to open the lights and open 
your eyes so that you can see for yourself.

359
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,029
And the complete knowledge becomes your own.

360
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,789
Then is better to talk.

361
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:41,760
Otherwise supposing even though when you can’t 
see,...o on giving you the complete history

362
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,179
about electricity and about everything.

363
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,610
You’ll be bored and stiff.

364
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,040
And its of no use.

365
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,070
First thing is you must get your realization.

366
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,210
That is the first thing.

367
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,640
Cancer can easily be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

368
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,780
Absolustely there is no doubt.

369
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,980
And there cannot be another doubt that it 
cannot be cured by anything else.

370
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:09,980
In our body, we have...articular system called 
as...ympathetic nervous system.

371
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:18,570
How this sympathetic nervous system goes into...errible 
tension when we go to extremes of any kind.

372
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,570
Say smoking, for example.

373
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,570
Now smoking is...ery interesting thing.

374
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,120
According to me, this America is the Visshuddi 
chakra....

375
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,010
is the center of this çenter.

376
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:35,809
This center gets spoiked when we smoke and 
the smoking is the maximum here.

377
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,370
Like the Europe is the liver and there people 
drink.

378
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:48,450
And they are so much in it and their lives 
are the worst of all in Europe.

379
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,789
England is the heart.

380
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:53,100
It (England) is lethargic....ean the whole 
thing is in such...ess that...on’t know

381
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
what...ave to face.

382
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,409
But...as happy to know that now the smoking 
is going down.

383
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,230
But with realization, smoking just disappears.

384
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,270
You don’t have to work at it.

385
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,279
Marsha herself used to smoke alot.

386
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,549
She told me....as amazed.

387
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,460
But she has biven up completely.

388
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,140
Drugs and all those things drop out just like 
something unnecessary because...ransformation

389
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
takes place.

390
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,690
And the transmutation starts...hen the transmutation 
starts, all these things drop out.

391
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,850
You enjoy the best of health...est of your 
heart...est of your miond....

392
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,720
and your emotions come out.

393
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,625
The best part of it is that this is what one 
has to achieve....

394
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:30,230
the whole humanity has to achieve.

395
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:38,750
But the few who are the seekers have to do 
it first.

396
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,150
They have to do it first; they are the foundation.

397
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,240
Like in every evolution, only...ew fishes 
had to come out; then many came

398
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
out.

399
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,960
In the same way, few people have to do it.

400
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,659
I’m happy there are...ew today.

401
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:56,730
Though others are disappointed,...m not....m 
happy because I’ll have to work harder.

402
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,590
If there are too many, maybe difficult.

403
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,419
As he said, it’s true that...ave realization 
to six thousand people in...illage in India.

404
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,850
But they are not complicated.

405
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,290
See, they aren’t so complicated.

406
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:15,419
They don’t live with the sorrows (word?) 
you have here or the tensions you have....

407
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,370
or the litigations you have....

408
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,730
the problems you have....ave seen Indians 
who have come here to earn money.

409
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,320
They have all gone off their heads....ean 
really, they have become half crazy.

410
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,839
The gentleman with whom...m now putting up, 
he told me already so many Indians have been

411
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,839
under litigation.

412
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,760
This happened, that happened and all kinds 
of tensions are building up.

413
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,940
Here, despite all our modern vest(word?) we 
also have landed ourselves into terrible tensions

414
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,009
of this machinery; this machinate and all 
that.

415
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:39,610
The villagers in India are extremely simple 
people.

416
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,840
They lead an extremely simple life.

417
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,280
They have no complications....on’t say that 
it would be so easy here as the way they have

418
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
got realization.

419
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,910
Of course, one has to work hard.

420
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:54,550
Like we had about seven people....ad all of 
them...t took about three hours to get realization.

421
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,160
So, it could be that way also.

422
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,680
It cannot be guaranteed; it cannot be promised.

423
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
It cannot be certified.

424
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,510
It has to happen...s the main point...s the 
happening...s the happening.

425
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,020
You have to become.

426
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,900
It has to be actualized.

427
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,349
It is not to be believed.

428
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:17,829
That’s what you should know.

429
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,130
If you are honest, you are to prove.

430
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,069
And, you want to have it, you’ll get it.

431
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:27,030
I’ll work very hard.

432
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:32,609
It’s you who has to have patience with yourself....ave 
all the patience and love.

433
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:34,510
No doubt about it.

434
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,349
But you all have to have patience....old you 
seven people...as working for four years.

435
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:45,280
Suppose its not going to be that bad, because 
with them...orked out many permutations and

436
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
combinations.

437
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,250
Now,...now all the permutations and combinations 
that are really harmful to people and how

438
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,450
they are eradicated.

439
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,650
But still...ould say...ould still have to 
study some American complications which...o

440
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,650
not know.

441
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:03,099
Nine years back, people were simpler people 
here and they are all mostly have gone away

442
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:08,890
or also at that time the same thing is that...ould 
not contact and everything works on money.

443
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:14,900
You see you have to give them money so they 
publisize you.

444
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,710
Then they publisize you...hen you get more 
money.

445
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,990
Here there is no question of money, you see.

446
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:30,820
You see my whole basic thing is you have to 
get real people so the real thing, without

447
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
money.

448
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,610
And then, you cannot have...ig circus; you 
cannot have...ig thing and it has to be started

449
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,630
in...enuine way...n...eal way.

450
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,380
They asked me that there is, there are agencies 
who work out all these tings....aid to begin

451
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
with...on’t think that

452
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,380
this is important.

453
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,450
We should work it out.

454
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,450
Let’s see.

455
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,890
There will be some people who feel attracted 
and come.

456
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,420
And let’s work it out this way.

457
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:04,780
Still,...ould like your advice as to where 
we can go, when, and in...ecent manner whenever

458
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
we can advertise.

459
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:12,550
Just now...ady told us that if you go to these 
shops it will be good idea.

460
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,690
We would like to invite people for this experience.

461
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,690
This is your right.

462
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:23,730
You are seekers and just like...ank, you have 
got your bank accounts and you just cash it.

463
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:34,210
And these are lots of places also.

464
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:47,680
And whatever mistakes are done, don’t worry 
about it.

465
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,500
One of the big problems...aced in Englad is 
that they all suffer from...enter or left

466
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,700
visshuddi which comes out of guilt.

467
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,300
You see, they are guilty all the time.

468
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,680
Maybe Catholicism that makes them feel guilty, 
but it’s...ery, very common trouble with

469
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
them.

470
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
They all the time feel guilty.

471
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,069
Now, what are you feeling guilty for?

472
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:06,069
We must suffer.

473
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:07,069
Why?

474
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:08,069
Why should you suffer?

475
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,069
Christ has suffered for you.

476
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,640
Did he leave anything for you to suffer?

477
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
We whould be guilty about what?

478
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,240
Why are you guilty?

479
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,120
I’m talking of ocean of compassion...cean 
of love.

480
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,280
Now what guilt can you have?

481
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,950
And is...ery big mistake to think that we 
have done little mistake here and little mistake

482
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,950
there.

483
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,360
God has to save this creation.

484
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,450
It is He who has to come in compassion and 
has to do something about it.

485
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,750
If He doesn’t save you, his creation is 
lost.

486
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,630
You shouldn’t feel like that inb...mall 
way.

487
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,970
It’s all very childish,...ould say, like...hild 
to feel “Oow” after this mistake.

488
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:59,839
But no...our Father is so great, is so full 
of love you have to just look at Him and He’ll

489
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,250
work it out.

490
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,470
You should forgive yourself; that is one of 
the things...ould request of you.

491
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,510
First of all, before forgiving anybody else, 
you must forgive yourself.

492
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,380
That is the first thing you have to do before 
realization.

493
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,880
Of course, in one lecture,...annot tell you 
much about it.

494
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,990
This is just an introductory lecture.

495
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:29,390
And we haven’t got our charts and all that 
because first day, if you start seeing the

496
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,040
charts, you (word?) mechanical and you think 
it’s some sort of...omputer.

497
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,370
You work it out.

498
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,680
Actually, you are...omputer, you become...ivine 
computer.

499
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,170
But that’s...ifferent system and so it’s 
better that we talk about it just now.

500
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,490
And you get your realization; work it out.

501
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:50,220
We are going to be here for some time and...ope 
you’ll be able to follow my lectures and

502
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,960
follow the whole thing.

503
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,780
It’s such...remendous thing....ust tell 
you about this in five hundred...00...ectures

504
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,910
in London...t least...inimum....ay that every 
time...peak.

505
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,600
They say, “Mother, you are speaking something 
now."

506
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,960
So, you can imagine how much knowledge there 
is there.

507
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,700
But you are knowledge; you become knowledge 
yourself.

508
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,569
In Australia, the newspaper people were very 
good to me because there was some happening....ady

509
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:11,200
was very seriously ill

510
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:19,980
and she had some sort of...ery serious stroke 
and...riend of hers was...ig man at the newspapers

511
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,690
and one of the Sahaja Yoginis there gave my 
photograph to her.

512
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,190
And she did get well from that...rom the photograph 
only.

513
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:35,570
So, this man started thinking about it and 
then they did...ig publicity for me.

514
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:45,280
So, it was lucky ,I should say, for Australians 
and...as there for about one month or so...hree

515
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
weeks.

516
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,240
And we got thousands there now...housands.

517
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,160
There are seven cities where we have seven 
centers.

518
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,980
It has worked....ust say, Australians are 
very good for realization.

519
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:08,480
It was surprising because certain people got 
realization and settled down and they knew

520
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,619
it was the trugh.

521
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,600
That was the thing.

522
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,839
YTou have to be intelligent enough to see 
what i8s the truth.

523
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,670
Don’t allow your intelligence to cheat you.

524
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,010
Be careful about your intelligence...lso, 
it can cheat you.

525
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,630
But you should be really sharp about it to 
see what is the truth.

526
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,540
And wise.

527
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:35,490
And that is what you are going to have.

528
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:51,349
Now,...ould request you to ask me questions 
because you see you all must be having lots

529
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,349
of questions.

530
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:58,170
You have your mind and you should better ask 
because...on’t want whild we are giving

531
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:06,500
you realization that you should feel that, 
“Oh,...idn’t ask this question to Mother,”...though

532
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,730
this makes no difference whether you ask me 
questions or not.

533
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,180
It is...ery different thing.

534
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,470
It is beyond your mind.

535
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,329
You go beyond your mind.

536
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:24,740
You go beyond your mind; beyond your ego; 
beyond your super-ego.

537
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,800
You become something else.

538
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,970
So if you have any questions, you can ask.

539
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:42,190
Question: There are many people who come offering 
realization.

540
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:48,020
You come offering realization....ould like 
to know something about this.

541
00:42:48,020 --> 00:43:04,750
In other words, you have something unique 
to offer, is that right?

542
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:16,809
Yes, of course...ould say...on’t know how 
many have come here and how many have been

543
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:20,030
thugs and how many have been real.

544
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,850
But, actually most of them have been thugs 
only because what they offer you...

545
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,850
don’t know...

546
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,200
have had people from other gurus...ll kinds 
of gurus you see.

547
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,800
And there are one or two sitting here.

548
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,730
All of them have been to someone or something 
like that.

549
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,220
Now as...old you, the uniqueness of Sahaja 
Yoga is this: Sahaja means...Saha” is with;

550
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,650
“ja” is born...s born with you....

551
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,190
is your own....

552
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,530
within you.

553
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,950
Now the uniqueness about it is this: that 
it is what you are seeking.

554
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:52,660
That’s what you are going to get....

555
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,730
is your spirit....

556
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,890
is that you become that...s the uniqueness.

557
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,420
It’s not that...an say there is...ourse 
of

558
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:13,490
ten days...ou go through the course or you 
pay for say...umping course or...o-called

559
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,510
flying course or something like that.

560
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,500
It is what you are.

561
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,700
You become that.

562
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,040
The uniqueness of it is that it’s...appening 
which is...iving happening.

563
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,170
You see, we don’t do anything that is...iving 
work.

564
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,130
What we do is...ead work.

565
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:46,840
Like...ree died; we make chairs; we think 
we have achieved alot.

566
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:52,480
You see this wall is all made of dead things, 
isn’t it?

567
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,370
We have just changed the form.

568
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,210
And these forms actually try to dominate us.

569
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:03,220
This chair becomes...ort of an obsession for 
us because we can’t sit on the ground....

570
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,910
this...e have to use...hair like that.

571
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,550
Now, anything that we do is all dead.

572
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,430
Supposing somebody has to jump.

573
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,620
Anybody can jump., What is there to be jumping?

574
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,500
People pay money to jump.

575
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,110
Can you imagine?...o take off clothes?...eople 
pay money.

576
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,420
How can that be?

577
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,490
What is so great about it?

578
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,980
We must understand: what do we become?

579
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,760
What powers do we become?

580
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
You see, there’s...uru.

581
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,910
He says, “Alright,...ive you some knowledge."

582
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,480
Now, what knowledge has he got?

583
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,640
One gentleman came.

584
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,950
He said, “I’ve already got knowledge."

585
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,270
...aid, “What knowledge do you have?”

586
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,030
For example, Warren can tell you where is 
your chakra catching.

587
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,410
Where is your kundalini; where it is obstructed; 
how to raise it; how to bring it us; how to

588
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,530
take it down.

589
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,160
The he can cure patients.

590
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,760
He must have cured...

591
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,359
don’t know how many.

592
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,869
You all can cure patientes and knowingly...hat 
it is.

593
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:06,609
What chakra is catching...hat is happening...hat 
is the mental process.

594
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:10,550
Everything, you know in your awareness.

595
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:16,020
You become...ifferent person...s...ransformation 
that takes place.

596
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,570
You become master of yourself.

597
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,650
To explain,...ill tell you...ery simple anology.

598
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,390
Say we are traveling by....

599
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,170
we are trying to learn how to drive.

600
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:32,690
Now you have got an accelerator and you have 
got...rake.

601
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,070
You’re working it out.

602
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:50,530
You see one, then another....e have two centers...wo 
channels within us which...how tomorrow...ne

603
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,630
for our actions.)

604
00:46:52,630 --> 00:47:02,530
So we start working both of these and start 
managing.

605
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,270
We go to extremes....

606
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:18,690
this way...hat way...nd make all kinds of 
mistakes...hatever it is...ut we try to balance

607
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,690
ourselves.

608
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,510
When do we learn the car driving?

609
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,420
When we learn it.

610
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,500
Once you have done that there the Master is...itting 
at the back.

611
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:38,510
And once He sees you have balanced it, He 
gives you your place.

612
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,950
You become the master of your being.

613
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,950
This is what has to happen....

614
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,950
the breakthrough!

615
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,630
The breakthrough has to take place.

616
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:53,150
Is not just...ake believe that, “Oh, we 
have become like this."

617
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,750
...ean there are people who believe they are 
self realized.

618
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,859
There are many like that, you see, that believe 
that they are that.

619
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:05,000
They are not.

620
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,690
Because they should be able to tell.

621
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,599
They should become collectively conscious.

622
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,030
They should be able to tell where is the kundalini; 
where is the problem.

623
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,030
Now, for

624
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,369
example, you are sitting....

625
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:21,609
alright, now you do not know about the gentleman 
next to you...here is the problem?

626
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,369
Where is his kundalini?

627
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,599
You cannot give him realization.

628
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:40,900
But the people who are realized souls...ven 
the small children...an do it...ery small

629
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,030
children.

630
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:49,480
They will immediately say, “This is the 
center catching.

631
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,280
Here...he finger...ittle children will show 
the same finger.

632
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,650
For example, if you have...roblem, say on 
this center.

633
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,650
Alright.

634
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:06,309
All the children you put some sort of...hing 
to close their eyes.

635
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:09,220
And ask them, “Which center is catching?”

636
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,880
They’ll all say this.

637
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,920
All will say the same thing.

638
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,940
And they also know how to correct this.

639
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,960
Little, little children know how to correct 
this.

640
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,240
They are born realized and born realized children 
are dynamic.

641
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,510
And they know...o many born-realized children 
are born these days.

642
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,980
How will you know whether they are born realized 
children?

643
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,760
You do not know who is...alse guru and who 
is...eal guru.

644
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,559
You don’t know anything!

645
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,349
There’s no discrimination power.

646
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:47,799
But, if you want to know also about that, 
you can just put the hands towards them and

647
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:50,819
they can find out.

648
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:54,599
Your vibrations will vanish completely.

649
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,880
You’ll have heat coming from horrible gurus.

650
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:10,190
If you see any horrible guru, you’ll find 
very bad vibrations coming in that...ll burning

651
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,770
and some of them just stop the vibrations.

652
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,690
You just don’t get any vibrations from them.

653
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,450
You can make it out from everyone what sort 
of...erson he is.

654
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,440
For example, there are athiests who don’t 
believe in God.

655
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Alright.

656
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,200
Now when they get realization they can ask 
the question, “Is there God?”

657
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,559
Tremendous vibrations.

658
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:42,079
To find out relatively, we can say, take three 
people...ne from...uru who’s horrid, one

659
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,650
from...unatic asylum, and one who’s...ealized 
soul, according to us.

660
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,650
Alright?

661
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,290
Now you put themn together.

662
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:56,660
You’ll find the one who’s from the guru, 
maybe feeling hot...ery hot...r may not get

663
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,089
realization at all...aybe frozen...nything.

664
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,089
The one from lunatic asylum may feel hot...orrible...ut 
he may get well...e may get realization.

665
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:04,760
And the third person, who is the one who is...ealized 
soul will get only...ool breeze.

666
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
We have cured many people who are meantally 
like that...any have been cured...ou can cure

667
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
also.

668
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
It is you who become that...s the point.

669
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,760
You become that...t’s your right.

670
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,760
You have been seeking all your lives.

671
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,760
Actually, it is impossible to believe that 
there could be someone who does it just for

672
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
loves sake.

673
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,809
You can’t believe itr because it’s so 
money oriented...he whole thing is so money

674
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:20,809
oriented....

675
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:22,869
that we can’t believe it.

676
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:30,770
Even our parents; we think they love us for 
money....ean, it has gone to that limit of

677
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,770
absurdity.

678
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,420
But God is l,ove and love is there.

679
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,740
Ånd in his love everyone should do it.

680
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,740
It has to happen.

681
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,740
Any other questions?

682
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,740
Question: (A woman asks where the other public 
meeting will be).

683
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,740
(Warren says he’ll make an announcement 
later)

684
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,740
Mother: You see, all of us have got it and 
we’ll give all that to you and you’ll

685
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,740
come along to those lectures and you will 
help us to bring...

686
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,569
(you see actually we do not know how to meet 
the seekers.

687
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:46,579
That’s the main point with us.

688
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,960
And we don’t need anything else.

689
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,589
Like the lady offered...lso.

690
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:52,630
We don’t need it.

691
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:53,940
We don’t need any money.

692
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,940
We have everything.

693
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,940
We have no problem.

694
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
And no money...othing.

695
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,920
We have got places to live in and we have 
no problem of any kind.

696
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,809
What we want...e have also got halls and everything 
and we don’t need anything.

697
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,724
But what we want...hat we want...eekers to 
come down and you have to suggest how to get

698
00:52:04,724 --> 00:52:05,930
them; that’s all.

699
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,140
(Announcements of meetings)

700
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,140
Question:...

701
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:13,290
lady asks for Mother’s comment on somebody 
but asks Her not to judge.)

702
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,770
Mother: No,...ave to.

703
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,260
I’m sorry,...ave to.

704
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,470
You see, it’s very good of you to say that...hould 
not make comment(word?).

705
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,470
But...ave to.

706
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,470
I’m sorry.

707
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,530
Because you see,...an’t bear to see the 
way their kundalini’s have gone down.

708
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,630
The connection has to be.

709
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,980
You see, when Christ was criticizing them, 
they said the same thing to him.

710
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,980
“Why should you criticize them?

711
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,240
They don’t critisize you?”

712
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:48,150
So He said, “The Satanic are not going to 
speak against the Satanic."

713
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,280
That’s what it is.

714
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,690
You do not know how serious it is.

715
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:09,030
When you will know, you will be amazed.

716
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:18,859
You do not know how serious it is and that’s 
shy you are saying that.

717
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:21,799
Once you find out shy...m saying this.

718
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:26,700
You see, it is not easy to say anything against 
these people.

719
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,790
It’s not easy.

720
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:31,549
Bust none of them...

721
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:48,280
have said about them...ach one of them about 
l0 years back...penly...bout each one of them...ho

722
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,670
they are.

723
00:53:50,670 --> 00:54:01,480
Nobody has even tried to even bring any suit 
or any law suit against me.

724
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,710
And whatever is wrong,...ave to say that.

725
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,250
I’m sorry, my child.

726
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,830
You see, this is not...hing where you can 
allow Satanic things to happen.

727
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,830
We have to discriminate.

728
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,830
You will know yourself.

729
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,830
You cannot love...nake like that.

730
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,490
You must know...nake is...nake and...uman 
being is...uman being.

731
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,490
Everybody has his own values.

732
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,770
You see,...m not here going to be angry with 
you for that.

733
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,770
But...m angry with them!...ith all of them...efinitely.

734
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,470
You do not...ou just wait and see.

735
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,619
You yourself will be so angry.

736
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:28,200
I’ll show you.

737
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,880
Say,...irl who came from one of them...hugs.

738
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,450
She was epileptic.

739
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,550
Her daughter was epileptic.

740
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,660
Her husband was epileptic.

741
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,230
She was...randdaughter of...uke.

742
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:42,380
She had lost all her money.

743
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,010
They had sold their house.

744
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,640
They were on the streets.

745
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,640
Absolutely.

746
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,750
And she is...eeker!

747
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,560
If you are...ohter, what would you say to 
that?

748
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,869
You will say they are very nice people?

749
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:55,970
You will go and garland them?

750
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,970
Not one, but I’ll show you thousands of 
them.

751
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,420
Here we have cases who have come.

752
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,800
She is Hesta...itting here.

753
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
You just ask her.

754
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,800
How much she was harmed!

755
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
How she was harmed.

756
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
She would have been dead!

757
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Do you think...hould say they are nice people?

758
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,800
Apart from anything else, they spoil your 
chances of realization.

759
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
I am not here for votes or anything.

760
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Why should...ry to please them?...ave to tell 
the truth, if you don’t mind....ave to tell.

761
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Question: Oh, then...ould just like to ask, 
what about people that are doing chakra therapy

762
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
and they charge very high prices?

763
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,170
Maybe they are not high prices and they help 
people and yet people don’t have that kind

764
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:22,890
of money....ould like to ask you, what do 
you think about people who do chakra therapy

765
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,890
and charge fees?

766
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:24,890
Mother:...on’t know what sort of...

767
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:25,890
(word?)

768
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:26,890
make believes.

769
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,890
How can you have any kind of chakra thearpy 
without realization?

770
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:28,890
It’s all make believe.

771
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:29,890
You blieve all this nonsensical people.

772
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,890
What am...o do now?

773
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:31,890
Why do you believe them?

774
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:32,890
You see chakra therapy,...ean...on’t know...n 
ordinary Indian can understand.

775
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:33,890
Only...aint can do it.

776
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:34,890
He has to be...aint.

777
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,890
How can he charge money?...aint will not take...ie 
from you.

778
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,890
It is...imple thing, try to understand that.

779
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:37,890
Question: Well,...lways thought that, but 
this is America.

780
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:38,890
Chakra therapy is...ew thing, I’ve heard...laugh) 
(woman keeps telling her story)

781
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,890
Mother:...ell you that.

782
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:40,890
What is it.

783
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,890
You might get...emporary help.

784
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,890
No doubt about it.

785
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:43,890
You can get...emporary help.

786
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,890
You see, now you are bringing into controversies 
so...ave to tell you about it.

787
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,890
But you don’t mind it.

788
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,890
What heppens within us, we have some stored 
energies in the chakras, alright?

789
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:47,890
And, like acupuncture, is also...s not to 
be done by someone who is not...ealized soul.

790
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:48,890
Is to be done only by realized souls.

791
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:49,890
If acupuncture is done by someone who is not...ealized 
soul...

792
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:50,890
mean it’s against Zen (?).

793
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,890
It’s against.

794
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,890
You have to be...word ?),...ean people don’t 
read about it....usha (word ?) means...ealized

795
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:53,890
soul.

796
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:54,890
If you are not...ealized soul, you are not 
supposed to do it.

797
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:55,890
Now, this one also...hakra therapy...hat you 
can do is to work on the sympathetic nervous

798
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,890
system.

799
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:57,890
Now the sympathetic nervous system, you can 
pull out the little energy that you have,

800
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,890
but you develop other problems with it.

801
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,890
Sahaja Yoga is...hing by which you get open 
to the all pervading power....ll the time

802
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,890
flowing within us.

803
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:25,059
You have to open yourslf to that universal 
being within your heart...hich is the spirit.

804
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:26,690
You don’t have to sort of lessen energy 
here and energy there and energy there.

805
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,690
You don’t have to take that energy out.

806
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:28,690
But the energy from the above comes in.

807
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,690
Like grace, it flows.

808
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,690
And that’s how always such things can lead 
into terrible problems...ental problems....

809
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,690
all kinds of things.

810
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,690
Supposing you try to treat somebody mentally....

811
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,690
then you extract the physical energy.

812
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,690
Then the person will suffer physically.

813
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:35,690
You see, this

814
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,690
stored energy for...articular chakra, which...ill 
explain to you...verything...ll right?

815
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,690
And you cannot charge for raising your kundalini 
because you have your kundalini intact there.

816
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,690
You are just there.

817
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,690
You have everything.

818
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,690
Only thing, by my being here, your kundalini 
rises by itself.

819
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,690
So you cannot pay.

820
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,690
Do you pay the Mother Earth for sprouting...eed?

821
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,690
They do help temporarily.

822
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,690
They do.

823
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,690
For example, somebody gives you...antra.

824
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,690
Alright, take...antra...’ll tell you...ay 
they say Rama Sita.

825
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:47,690
Now, there cannot be only one mantra belonging 
to any one in any science of mantras.

826
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,690
Because you people are so naive...ou see...hey 
say “all right, you take the name of Rama."

827
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,690
This cannot be done.

828
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,690
Rama mantra is only on the right heart chakra.

829
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,690
If you have...roblem, has to be given by...ealized 
soul because it has to be...onnected one.

830
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,690
It is...cience, you know.

831
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,690
All of them know what mantra is to be said 
at what point because they know how to raise

832
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:54,690
the kundalini....

833
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,690
they know where it is obstructed and what 
mantra is to be said and which Deity is to

834
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,690
be awakened.

835
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,940
Notice the mantra for which particular mantra 
(word?)...hey know all that and they know

836
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,940
all the methods.

837
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
But why they may give you...antra?

838
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,940
Now, you may feel better...eally, sometimes 
you may feel dynamic.

839
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,940
You feel, “Oh,...m very activated; maybe...m 
over active."

840
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,940
And...pirit (if that name may be allowed) 
may come around...nd you may become possessed...nd

841
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,940
you might become extremely active.

842
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,940
But, then you’ll go down.

843
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,940
Within five years, there will be...omplete 
decline.

844
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
You’ll be...ecluse.

845
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,940
You’ll be...rightened person.

846
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,940
You’ll be...oward.

847
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,940
You won’t be able to even...here are people 
I’ve known who can not even face (what do

848
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
you call that...arlic.

849
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,940
Can you imagine...fraid of...egetable?

850
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,940
It’s really...here are people, if you snow 
then garlic, they are frightened....ean, are

851
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,940
you going to become like that?

852
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,940
Is that freedom?

853
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Question: (A man had treid raising his kundalini 
and was asking about seeing something (?) in

854
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,940
his head and other places).

855
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:18,940
Mother: You see, if you try your own self, 
you see trying with the kundalini...ctually

856
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
the sympathetic goes into activity.

857
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,940
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

858
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,940
Parasympathetic is the one which balances 
and that is the central path of Sushumna through

859
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
which the kundalini has to rise.

860
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,940
But if you try anything, what you do is...lways 
you can use sympathetic.

861
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,940
I’ll give you an example.

862
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,940
Supposing you are running fast.

863
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,940
Alright, then you can raise the rate of your 
heart.

864
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,940
But you cannot slow it down.

865
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,940
It slows down

866
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,940
by itself.

867
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,940
That is parasympathetic activity.

868
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,940
So you just get into sympathetic activity 
and sympathetic activity, if you overdo it,

869
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,940
then all these symptoms happen and it’s 
not healthful.

870
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,940
On the contrary, chakras go into...

871
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,940
.(quite like this is the left and the right 
sympathetic and these are the centers).

872
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
They get pulled down like that and if they 
are pulled like this, then you are harmed.

873
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,940
So is not an experience of kundalini; is of 
the sympathetic.

874
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,940
Question: “....his wasn’t anything...as 
looking for or asking for, (etc.)but how come

875
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,940
it went down, instead of coming up?”

876
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
Mother: No, it doesn’t go down.

877
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940
Kundalini never goes down.

878
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,940
It goes upward...lways.

879
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,940
The thing that comes down is the grace, you 
see.

880
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,940
The grace comes down, not the Kundalini.

881
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,940
Kundalini always goes upwards.

882
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,940
And the grace comes on your sympathetic which 
cools you down completely.

883
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,940
You become absolutely relaxed with the grace.

884
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,940
But the kundalini itself always goes up.

885
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,940
It never comes down.

886
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,940
But, in people, it so happens that kundalini 
goes through this central path.

887
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,940
Now, if it is...ort of...ery much rugged or 
if it is extremely smooth due to the mistakes

888
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
of the seekers, then it falls down.

889
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
It falls down...t falls down is...ifferent 
point then going like that.

890
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,940
It falls down.

891
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,940
Then you have to raise it again and tie it 
up.

892
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
Again, raise it and tie it up.

893
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,940
In many people, it has to be done but it can 
work out.

894
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
You will get the complete knowledge, don’t 
you worry.

895
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
Now, he has been in eighteen months, but he 
is...aster of kundalini.

896
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
He can raise your kundalini and you are just 
like him.

897
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
You would become the same.

898
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,940
There’s no problem at all.

899
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
It will work out.

900
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,940
Question:...ow did you get your realization?”

901
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,940
Mother:...as born like that.

902
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,940
I’m like this for ages....

903
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,940
ancient....m...ystery...

904
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,940
should say at the beginning.

905
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,940
We should keep it as...ystery.

906
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,940
Then you’ll discover me, all right?

907
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,940
Let’s have it that way.

908
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,940
First you discover yourself and then discover 
me.

909
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,940
Will be better idea, isn’t it?

910
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,940
Because...on’t want to say something which 
will unnecessarily make some people upset.

911
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,940
Best is...ou become something.

912
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,940
Question:...s it true...ealized guru has cool 
air; not hot?”

913
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,940
Mother: No, hot is very dangerous.

914
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,940
Interuption: “....ut...ool one, is also 
dangerous?”

915
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,940
Mother:...ut you don’t get air.

916
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,940
You might feel extremely cool if you are...ow 
blood pressure patient.

917
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,940
If you are...eft sided persons...f you are 
possessed, you feel absolutely cool, very

918
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,940
cool.

919
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,940
That’s not good.

920
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,940
Feeling cool is different from...ool breeze; 
like you feel...reeze coming.

921
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
But should not be hot in any case.

922
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
Hot is...ery dangerous thing.

923
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,940
If it is too hot, that heat...t’s not good.

924
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,940
Question: “Why do you get...low of hot air?”

925
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,940
Mother: It’s...riction.

926
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
It’s...riction of the Divine.

927
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,940
You see, when the Kundalini’s rising, She 
should normally give you cool breeze....

928
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
cool breeze in the hands...hen She does.

929
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,940
But if there’s...riction...lways friction 
makes it hot.

930
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,940
But it cools down.

931
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,940
There’s no problem.

932
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,940
In the beginning, most of you will get hot, 
little bit.

933
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,940
Because, after all, you see you know...ou 
are all very complicated people.

934
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,940
Our brains especially are modern brains, you 
see.

935
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,940
So we have been thinking, thinking, thinking.

936
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,940
Just, we cannot stop our thinking for...inute 
even.

937
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
But the first thing that will happen is that 
you enter into thoughtless awareness.

938
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
That’s called as Nirvachara Samahdi, in 
Sanskrit.

939
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,940
Means you become....

940
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,940
you are aware, absolutely aware.

941
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,940
There are no thoughts.

942
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
The thoughts(word?)...hat the awakening of 
Christ...hat’s the thing that should happen

943
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,940
to you.

944
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,940
Once that happens, then it passes through 
here and you can feel the cool breeze.

945
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,940
Many people who smoke cannot feel breeze in 
the hand at the beginning because of this

946
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,940
chakra being...ittle bit in trouble.

947
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,940
But, then you start feeling...arsha (??), you 
feel quite all right in the hands?

948
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,940
She used to smoke.

949
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
She is...reat seeker,...ust say.

950
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,940
All right, should we have it now?

951
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,940
Question: “If we’re going to receive the 
Kundalini awakening, is it...rocess over several

952
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
days?”

953
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,940
Mother: No, it is...plit of...econd actually; 
it is...plit of...econd.

954
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,940
But it takes time in some people, as...aid, 
because if there are obstructions...ou see.

955
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,940
Now if you have...eautiful runway and...eautiful 
aircraft, then the landing and take off are

956
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,940
very smooth.

957
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,940
But sometimes it is...econd-hand stop.

958
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,940
Interruption:...hen, you mean it may come 
tomorrow?”

959
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,940
Warren: No, it’s highly likely you’ll 
get it tonight.

960
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,940
Mother: Yes, of course, just now.

961
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,940
Just now.

962
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,940
But you have to learn how to maintain it, 
is the point.

963
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,940
Just now, you are going to have it.

964
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,940
It’s spontaneous.

965
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,940
It is just now.

966
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,940
But only one thing is that you should know 
how to maintain it.

967
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,940
Now supposing you get it and then outside 
you start thinking about it.

968
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,940
Then it goes down.

969
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,940
The vibrations will be lost.

970
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,940
You have to be careful.

971
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,940
It’s like...eed sprouting, you know....eed 
sprouting.

972
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,940
It’s...eedling in the beginning.

973
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,940
So you have to be careful for about seven 
days.

974
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,940
If you are careful, it is settled down in 
about seven days.

975
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,940
You have to be careful.

976
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,940
We will tell you about it.

977
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Interruption: “The reason I’m asking is 
because we’ll become messengers...

978
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,940
”

979
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,940
Mother: Yes, of course, of course.

980
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,940
Next time I’m not going to import people 
from Australia and from England.

981
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,940
You have got to have the Americans here to 
do this job.

982
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,940
We are not going to import them from all over 
the place.

983
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,940
Two are coming from Switzerland.

984
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,940
So that’s not...ery good sign....hink, actually, 
Americans should go abroad and do it.

985
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,940
They’ll go to India and to Indian villages....

986
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
and they’ll do it in the Indian villages.

987
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
Very simple, alright?

988
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,940
Question: (Unintelligible....

989
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,940
something about...eadache).

990
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,940
Mother:...ell you what’s the problem with 
you.

991
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,940
You have...iver problem.

992
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,940
You have...iver problem and that is showing.

993
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,940
You see this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

994
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,940
Once you get realization, you start seeing 
your body; feeling it.

995
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,940
Whatever your problem, you know.

996
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,940
You have You have...iver problem and it has 
to be corrected.

997
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,940
Now,...now you have...iver problem sitting 
down here.

998
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,940
And it’s very simple.

999
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,940
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you can correct your liver 
in no time.

1000
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,940
Once you correct your liver, you’ll have 
never...eadache.

1001
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,940
But, it suggests that you have that and you’d 
better get rid of it.

1002
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,940
You see it’s good you have...eadache, now 
you’ll get after your liver.

1003
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,940
Otherwise, it becomes horribly bad, if you 
continue....ean,...erson becomes mad and still

1004
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,940
he doesn’t know that he’s gone mad.

1005
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,940
It’s like that.

1006
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,940
The disease crawls into you.

1007
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,940
But in Sahaja Yoga, immediately you know.

1008
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,940
And you are...iver patient, you know that.

1009
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,940
It has to be corrected and it’s not difficult.

1010
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,940
Most of the diseases can be cured, except 
for...ew like...hould say, cataracts or something

1011
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,940
like that where something is dead or maybe 
where they put an artificial limb and all

1012
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,940
that.

1013
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,940
We can’t work out all of these things.

1014
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,940
But most of the things get cured, automatically....ean, 
here they say if you cure someone, you’ll

1015
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:58,940
get put in the prison....ean,...on’t cure.

1016
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,940
You just get cured, you see.

1017
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,940
So...ope legally I’m all right.

1018
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,940
Christ would have been in jail here....on’t 
know about the laws.

1019
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,940
But this time, I’m sure they cannot crucify 
me.

1020
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,940
It’s alright.

1021
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:03,944
Let’s work it out.
