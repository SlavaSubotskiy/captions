1
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:44,542
Tonight, we are going

2
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,041
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

3
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:02,000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

4
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,000
prosperity and also of health

5
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,333
Actually your country is already blessed,

6
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,083
because you have so many things here.

7
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:32,458
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

8
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

9
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:51,083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

10
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,959
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

11
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,917
Also you have diamonds.

12
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,959
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

13
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,250
Also gold you have.

14
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,792
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

15
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:43,291
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

16
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,125
to get to you people.

17
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,500
I’m sure it will work out.

18
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:09,041
But in Sahaja Yoga,

19
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:14,417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

20
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,875
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

21
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,834
If you don’t have satisfaction

22
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

23
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,750
One becomes very greedy.

24
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:50,291
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

25
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

26
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

27
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,709
who are very greedy.

28
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

29
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

30
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:37,125
First people try to seek food,

31
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,667
in the Nabhi Chakra

32
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,709
– then they eat – that is Swaha

33
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,667
– then it is being retained in the body.

34
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

35
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,792
he gets sick, he has problems.

36
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,291
But he goes to the second stage

37
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,709
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

38
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,999
because he eats thinking that it is,

39
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,625
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

40
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

41
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,333
In a very simple manner he eats.

42
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

43
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,792
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

44
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,291
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

45
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:23,834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

46
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,625
It is alcohol.

47
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

48
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

49
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

50
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,583
They give up drinking,

51
00:14:55,875 --> 00:15:01,542
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

52
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,041
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

53
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,291
We should have Lakshmi

54
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

55
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

56
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,291
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

57
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:43,125
That symbolizes that a person who has money

58
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:51,417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

59
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,792
– pink color is for love and invitation.

60
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,625
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

61
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,959
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

62
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:21,333
The beetle comes to the lotus

63
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,709
to collect some honey

64
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:30,166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

65
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:53,333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

66
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

67
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,542
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

68
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:13,333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

69
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:29,041
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

70
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,375
till the morning.

71
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,792
Then when the beetle has rested well,

72
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:45,208
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

73
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,417
We can state poetically

74
00:17:55,667 --> 00:18:01,333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

75
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,709
because it is seeking the honey.

76
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,375
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

77
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:27,875
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

78
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,792
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

79
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:47,166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

80
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:56,959
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

81
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:05,291
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

82
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
as in the West I have seen,

83
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:12,041
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

84
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:23,417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

85
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

86
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

87
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

88
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,291
this hand suggests that a person who has money

89
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

90
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,083
If they do not share,

91
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,375
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

92
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,291
when giving to others is so joyful.

93
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,875
Another hand is like this -

94
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,375
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

95
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

96
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:37,709
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

97
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,083
Anything happens in your family,

98
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:57,041
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

99
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,333
you must stand by that person.

100
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,834
Some people try to help their relations

101
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:18,542
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

102
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,583
But by cheating, what you are doing

103
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

104
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,250
you are not really helping.

105
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,625
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

106
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,959
specially his moral character.

107
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,959
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

108
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:06,999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

109
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,875
there are horrible films coming

110
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:15,458
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

111
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:31,125
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

112
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,125
women and men.

113
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:44,417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

114
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:53,333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

115
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,333
and you will have problems with money.

116
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,750
So the wealth that you have

117
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:08,166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

118
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,125
in your behavior, in your living.

119
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:24,709
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

120
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:35,166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

121
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,875
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

122
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,667
because it floats over the water.

123
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:55,917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

124
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:00,083
but of a very mirthful...

125
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,875
and She doesn’t show off

126
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:14,041
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

127
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,959
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

128
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

129
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

130
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:50,083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

131
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,750
But there should be detachment.

132
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

133
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:05,208
and still He was so detached,

134
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:10,375
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

135
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,709
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

136
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:25,083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

137
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:35,375
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

138
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:47,999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

139
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,667
He was living in the palace

140
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

141
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,959
who were throwing pearls on him.

142
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:12,208
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

143
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

144
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,709
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

145
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,208
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

146
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

147
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

148
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,999
such a person cannot get Realization."

149
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:58,959
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

150
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,375
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

151
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,750
and He was enjoying the bath.

152
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:23,041
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

153
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,625
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

154
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,375
He didn’t bother.

155
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:42,291
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

156
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,750
Then he says that, somebody said

157
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,250
that now the fire is coming here.

158
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

159
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,959
But Nachiketa ran out

160
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,875
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

161
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

162
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:25,750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

163
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,166
This is how you are tested,

164
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:38,542
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

165
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,917
She’s the one who is testing.

166
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,250
All the greedy people,

167
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

168
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:57,375
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

169
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,291
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

170
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:10,291
they are all the time worried.

171
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:20,166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

172
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:27,750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

173
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:36,709
Because is said also in the economics,

174
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:40,917
that wants are not satiable in general.

175
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,875
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

176
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,625
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

177
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

178
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,583
you never enjoy the carpet,

179
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,834
for which you have worked so hard.

180
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,417
Then you have a house,

181
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

182
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

183
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,917
This is how it goes on

184
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,458
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

185
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,458
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

186
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,750
There is no peace in your heart

187
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,375
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

188
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,667
you will feel extremely satisfied

189
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,500
with everything that is materialistic.

190
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,291
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

191
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:22,500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

192
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,291
that you start seeking.

193
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,542
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

194
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,999
because you get your Self-realization.

195
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:53,417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

196
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

197
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:10,041
and we should express our love by giving something,

198
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,041
whatever it is, to the needy person.

199
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,250
I have seen Myself,

200
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,792
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

201
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:35,125
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

202
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:43,834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

203
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

204
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,291
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

205
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

206
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:08,500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

207
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,542
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

208
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:22,959
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

209
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:28,875
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

210
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,166
She told Shri Ram that,

211
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:46,542
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

212
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:53,417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

213
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:59,667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

214
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:23,250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

215
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

216
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

217
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:40,917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

218
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,291
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

219
00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:02,542
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

220
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,083
So His wife Sita said,

221
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:14,750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

222
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:24,875
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

223
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,959
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

224
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,625
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

225
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,125
He asked His sister-in-law,

226
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

227
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,542
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

228
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:59,083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

229
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,959
What was in that ber was nothing

230
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,291
but giving sense of this old lady.

231
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:25,083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

232
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

233
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:43,375
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

234
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,834
The other day we had brought some presents,

235
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:58,458
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

236
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:10,083
That is how we all have to live,

237
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:21,291
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

238
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:31,458
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

239
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,417
Think what others like.

240
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:44,417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

241
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,417
They know what you like to eat.

242
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,375
So if you go to their house,

243
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:01,250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

244
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:11,375
And they will make what I would like

245
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:16,208
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

246
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

247
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

248
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:41,417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

249
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,250
when you share it with others.

250
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:56,208
My father was a great Realized soul,

251
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:04,250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

252
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:12,375
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

253
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

254
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,208
what about records – he can’t buy –

255
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:32,917
how will he play?

256
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:39,999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

257
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

258
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,291
please come and take away the records also.”

259
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

260
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,208
The one who is satisfied

261
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,709
and is happiest when he can give something.

262
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

263
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,834
So we have to learn to share,

264
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:35,917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

265
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,875
that is Self-realization.

266
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,250
What more can you give?

267
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,625
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

268
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:53,875
how happy you feel.

269
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

270
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,834
is in giving Realizations to others.

271
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,041
I have seen people, their faces change

272
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:17,250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

273
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:31,417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

274
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:36,375
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

275
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

276
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

277
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:03,166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

278
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,458
you will not be happy.

279
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,458
I heard the other day,

280
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:17,542
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

281
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:26,083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

282
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:32,500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

283
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

284
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,542
I told her, “You change your attitude,

285
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:49,333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

286
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,208
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

287
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,834
Because you have become such a dry person,

288
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:02,959
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

289
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

291
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:24,166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

292
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,792
of supporting, of sharing.

293
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:39,041
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

294
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,999
who will try to have their own party.

295
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,542
They are very power-oriented.

296
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,125
They will have an exclusive party.

297
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:04,500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

298
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:11,458
Everything should be collective.

299
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,959
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

300
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,208
you should know is a possessed person,

301
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

302
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,208
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

303
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:36,999
and we have to live like one family,

304
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:47,083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

305
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:59,083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

306
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:03,291
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

307
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

308
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:22,125
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

309
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,291
There are nine Lakshmis,

310
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,999
but next time I’ll tell you.

311
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:37,250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

312
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:46,999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

313
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:51,417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

314
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,291
But I would request you

315
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,375
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

316
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,834
that very few people have got in this world.

317
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,417
Nourish it with your love.

318
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:27,375
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

319
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,542
If there is any problem, anything

320
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,375
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

321
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:48,417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

322
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:56,542
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

323
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,709
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

324
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:10,792
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

325
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:14,417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

326
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:31,083
You got powers,

327
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,375
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

328
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,542
we have to save the world.

329
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,500
So, May God Bless you all.
