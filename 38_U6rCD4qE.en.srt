00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,723
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

2
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:09,794
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

3
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:18,851
and you should know that the essence of Guru

4
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:22,634
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

5
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:29,914
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

6
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:34,234
faithful wife, of a sati.

7
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:38,674
Her name was Anasuya,

8
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:45,074
and she was so religious

9
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:48,834
and so dedicated

10
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:53,394
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

11
00:00:53,634 --> 00:01:00,234
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

12
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:07,201
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

13
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:13,514
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,754
So all of them came down as sadhus,

15
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,714
dressed up like sanyasis.

16
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,554
And she said she wanted to serve them,

17
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,554
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

18
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,954
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

19
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:37,434
She cooked food for them.

20
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,394
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

21
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:43,954
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

22
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:48,354
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

23
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:51,754
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

24
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:56,394
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

25
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,674
and then she became nude,

26
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,714
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

27
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:07,114
And then she joined them together,

28
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:11,554
their three innocences were joined together

29
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:20,634
and they got their Gurupada.

30
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:25,634
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

31
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:31,914
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

32
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,754
you have to be innocent.

33
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:40,074
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

34
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:47,954
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

35
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:51,634
But what is the nature of innocence?

36
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:57,394
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

37
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:58,434
First of all

38
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:05,674
He's endowed with wisdom,

39
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:12,514
and He puts wisdom into us.

40
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:20,554
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

41
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:28,034
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

42
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:35,154
It is He who puts genetics in us.

43
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:43,114
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

44
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:47,234
and when He puts wisdom in us,

45
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:52,074
then we are wise.

46
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:58,634
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

47
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:03,554
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

48
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,354
They have no wisdom.

49
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:09,034
They do things without wisdom.

50
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:14,554
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

51
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:18,194
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

52
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,634
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

53
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:23,114
but you can see from their behavior they're,

54
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:27,034
that they have no wisdom at all.

55
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:34,354
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

56
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,394
In some people who are not yet evolved,

57
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,434
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

58
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,034
this wisdom is lacking.

59
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,194
Apart from that,

60
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:53,794
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

61
00:04:55,914 --> 00:05:02,194
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

62
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:06,394
all kinds of bad habits.

63
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:10,834
We don't like to look at nudity.

64
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:17,354
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

65
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:24,634
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

66
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:32,114
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

67
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:38,474
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

68
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:43,634
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

69
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:47,394
We are automatically dharmic.

70
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,554
We don't kill others,

71
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,674
we don't aggress others,

72
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:53,954
we don't torture others.

73
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:59,434
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

74
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:03,274
or take away anything,

75
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:07,714
another's property or another's things.

76
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:13,114
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

77
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:20,394
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

78
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:24,754
It is He only ultimately

79
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,834
who looks after us

80
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:31,754
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

81
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:35,234
because

82
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:40,434
He stops all other activities of excretion

83
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:47,834
when you are ascending into new realm.

84
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:53,034
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

85
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,874
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

86
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:59,554
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

87
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:05,194
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

88
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:09,314
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

89
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,794
So this wisdom is innate,

90
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:18,194
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

91
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:22,914
He becomes, manifesting in us -

92
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:27,714
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

93
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:32,434
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

94
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:36,714
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

95
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,634
You become the child,

96
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,434
at that time you become a child.

97
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,674
And with the kundalini rising,

98
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,394
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

99
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:51,643
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

100
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,874
He's the power in the kundalini.

101
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,914
He gives wisdom in the brain.

102
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:03,274
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

103
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:07,874
all your attachments which are wrong,

104
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:13,874
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

105
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,394
He changes, your genetics are changed.

106
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:21,314
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

107
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,874
about the same I would say,

108
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:30,314
and the genetics of other people would be different.

109
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:33,514
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

110
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,834
because Indians normally are very wise people.

111
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,586
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

112
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:42,794
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

113
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,474
Indians are very wise.

114
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:48,194
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

115
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,674
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

116
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,314
when they go to India: they went for this school,

117
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:57,312
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

118
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,113
nobody could understand.

119
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,914
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

120
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:03,554
They got malaria.

121
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,834
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

122
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:12,874
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

123
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:14,754
So they put a gate.

124
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,914
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

125
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:21,114
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

126
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:27,674
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

127
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,434
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

128
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,714
he understands the importance of his life.

129
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,834
He respects his parents, he respects everything

130
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,554
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

131
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:45,434
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

132
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:52,194
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

133
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,994
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

134
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:03,434
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

135
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:09,634
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

136
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:13,274
so much developed in these Western countries,

137
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:16,954
people took to stupid things.

138
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:22,474
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

139
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:26,994
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

140
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:30,434
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

141
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,386
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

142
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,234
they have no Ganesha.

143
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,674
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

144
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:41,114
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

145
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:45,554
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

146
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:48,194
Before that you just call "holy father",

147
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,514
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

148
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:54,994
which can create holes in the organization;

149
00:10:55,634 --> 00:11:00,874
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

150
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:05,674
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

151
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,234
So this wisdom part is so important,

152
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,624
and that's what we should ask

153
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,994
Ganesha, to make us like children.

154
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:20,754
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

155
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,114
This is the thing is,

156
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:26,234
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

157
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:31,274
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

158
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:36,794
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

159
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:42,074
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

160
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:45,274
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

161
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:48,113
because there's no strength from within.

162
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:51,753
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

163
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:53,673
Now you know yourself,

164
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:56,193
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

165
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,474
they behave differently, they stand differently,

166
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,308
they talk differently, they think differently, they

167
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,914
- everything is different.

168
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:06,794
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

169
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:11,834
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

170
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:15,274
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

171
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:16,634
everything they did.

172
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:19,514
But how is it suddenly you changed?

173
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:24,634
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

174
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:30,274
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

175
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:35,314
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

176
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:41,114
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

177
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,074
But is it so with us?

178
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:48,874
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

179
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:53,914
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

180
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:57,434
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

181
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:01,114
that means they have to ascend still.

182
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:03,874
People who have worked with Me,

183
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,514
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

184
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,314
There's no need to pay,

185
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,634
because after all I have done so much for your building,

186
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,634
your body, why should I pay you?

187
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,554
But I always pay sumptuously,

188
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,434
I look after them, give them ...

189
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:21,554
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

190
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,434
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

191
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,994
extremely selfish.

192
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:31,114
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

193
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:36,034
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

194
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:41,914
Or they just try to find some excuse.

195
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,394
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

196
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,234
They are not sincere.

197
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,914
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

198
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:53,554
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

199
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:56,314
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

200
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:59,794
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

201
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:03,554
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

202
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:08,274
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

203
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:19,834
For example, someone becomes sick.

204
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:23,554
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

205
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:27,394
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

206
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:30,554
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

207
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:33,714
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

208
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,434
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

209
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:41,714
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

210
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:45,394
what is important.

211
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:49,834
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

212
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:52,434
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

213
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:56,794
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

214
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,314
All kinds of liabilities come in,

215
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:03,074
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

216
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:06,034
You solve the problem with your husband.

217
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,314
You solve the problem with your children.

218
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:12,234
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

219
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,554
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

220
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,234
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

221
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:19,554
can you believe that?

222
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,714
Nobody else can touch it.

223
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,194
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

224
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,714
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,034
So we have many cases like that.

226
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:30,794
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

227
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,754
they have seen miraculous photographs,

228
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:36,194
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

229
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,954
they have been so many times helped.

230
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:42,514
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

231
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,234
"Very good," I say,

232
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,954
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

233
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:53,114
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

234
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,914
and no place for such half-hearted people.

235
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,314
If they have to leave, they should leave.

236
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:04,554
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

237
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,421
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

238
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,592
That way you were worshipping Christ,

239
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,713
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

240
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:15,194
But what has come inside you, is the point.

241
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:19,114
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

242
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:25,194
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

243
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:30,554
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

244
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,874
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

245
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:39,754
You are also made the same way.

246
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:43,994
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

247
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:47,514
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

248
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:51,114
All these things have happened to you

249
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:55,434
without having a father.

250
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:00,194
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

251
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,554
you would never have known.

252
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,354
Like, other gurus, you see,

253
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:11,634
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

254
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:14,554
So this actually has happened with you,

255
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:19,793
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

256
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,513
Of course you must be having something, you know,

257
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:25,194
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

258
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:30,754
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

259
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:35,754
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

260
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:36,914
if not crooked,

261
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:41,154
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

262
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:47,834
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

263
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,114
that you were seeking it truly,

264
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:56,354
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

265
00:17:56,794 --> 00:18:00,154
Still, when the growth is taking place,

266
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,354
you must watch,

267
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:07,154
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

268
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:13,354
with what dedication we are working out?

269
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:16,234
Now, we have people

270
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,034
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

271
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:22,034
- not now, it's long time back -

272
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:25,794
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

273
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:29,194
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

274
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:33,154
otherwise they would have charged Me!

275
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:40,234
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

276
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:43,234
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

277
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:46,714
But still we have people on the periphery,

278
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,274
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

279
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:53,034
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

280
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:53,954
You don't know,

281
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:59,914
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

282
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:02,354
and then He stopped it.

283
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,874
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

284
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,794
then only the storm stopped,

285
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:10,714
just to prove that these songs have such power.

286
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,633
If such things don't happen,

287
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,682
how will you know that these songs have the power?

288
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:18,879
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,331
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

290
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,783
all awakened songs.

291
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:27,434
And then it stopped.

292
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,834
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

293
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:33,513
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

294
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:36,234
Suddenly they thought of singing,

295
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:38,354
and then it worked out.

296
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:41,274
Because every time if I have to suggest,

297
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:44,914
then when will you use your power?

298
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:46,754
All such incidents take place,

299
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,274
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

300
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:50,896
He's the real judge for you.

301
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:53,634
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

302
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:57,434
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

303
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,514
So there is a testing point also.

304
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:03,754
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

305
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:06,434
But there's a bigger door on the back side

306
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:09,514
to throw out people.

307
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:18,514
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

308
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:22,994
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

309
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:26,154
Then to come back is very difficult.

310
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,154
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

311
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,634
and others are also suspicious of you.

312
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:36,234
So you see, what you have to understand

313
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,994
is that this is a judgment point.

314
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:41,914
Introspect yourself, find out,

315
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:46,554
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

316
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,314
Is it wise for me to do?

317
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:53,274
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

318
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,954
Should I do it or not?"

319
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,114
At every point you should see.

320
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,994
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

321
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:02,672
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

322
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:03,913
but they won't listen.

323
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:04,907
Now they are saying that

324
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,381
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

325
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:10,313
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

326
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,554
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

327
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,190
there's one thing definitely:

328
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:18,071
there's love, and you want to express it.

329
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:22,274
But love here is not attached;

330
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:28,794
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

331
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,794
takes all the responsibility.

332
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,634
There is people, there are people

333
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,154
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

334
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,074
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

335
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:44,074
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

336
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:46,634
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

337
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,794
He's trying to criticize others,

338
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:52,554
does he see what is wrong with him?

339
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:56,394
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

340
00:21:56,874 --> 00:22:01,554
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

341
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:06,034
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

342
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:11,114
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

343
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:14,194
and they are in the sternum bones first,

344
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,674
and then they go all over the body.

345
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:20,514
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

346
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,474
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

347
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,234
So we have to be alert.

348
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:32,034
It's very important that we have to be alert.

349
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,114
For about twelve years of your age

350
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:38,234
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

351
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,594
and then they go to the whole body,

352
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,273
because they are matured enough.

353
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,910
They are kept there till they are completely matured

354
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,794
to fight the enemies.

355
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:51,074
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

356
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:55,554
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

357
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:01,314
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

358
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:05,194
who should fight whom, who should do this.

359
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:10,554
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

360
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:15,194
So we have to go to the people.

361
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,754
We have to go into the Virata's body.

362
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:22,874
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

363
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:26,554
without having any fear you have to fight them.

364
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,802
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

365
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,274
now you are all grown-up people.

366
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:38,394
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

367
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:43,554
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

368
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:44,874
"Ma treya."

369
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:48,394
But also that He goes all out in the society,

370
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:53,554
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

371
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:58,914
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

372
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:02,994
Guru doesn't sit at home.

373
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,194
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

374
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:10,794
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

375
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:12,659
You have to live in the society,

376
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,064
you don't have to have exclusive society

377
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:18,994
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

378
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:23,554
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

379
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:27,034
But you have to go beyond.

380
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:31,194
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

381
00:24:31,394 --> 00:24:35,794
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

382
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:38,114
but you have to go all out,

383
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:39,794
meet other people,

384
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,394
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,554
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

386
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:49,034
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

387
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,194
You don't have to give up anything,

388
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,634
don't have to give up anything.

389
00:24:54,874 --> 00:25:00,196
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

390
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:02,631
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

391
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,674
also disco dance they showed you.

392
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:07,714
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

393
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:11,834
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

394
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,874
Or do this kind of a disco more there

395
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:19,034
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

396
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:23,034
Then you say, "We are copying you."

397
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,419
That will put them down.

398
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,234
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

399
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:34,112
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

400
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,833
and smoking like this.

401
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:38,794
She'll stop it.

402
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:42,234
So by copying them, one way,

403
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:45,554
showing them what they are - another, writing.

404
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,154
You must have writing.

405
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:50,714
It's very important to write and answer.

406
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:53,474
I must tell that there's a very nice article

407
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:55,274
which has come now with Me,

408
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:57,787
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

409
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:59,708
and answer the gentleman.

410
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,754
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

411
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:07,274
You must know what's happening all around -

412
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:10,954
what's happening in Bosnia,

413
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,554
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

414
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,754
You should read newspapers.

415
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,554
You can see television also,

416
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,474
when - and now, when you are matured.

417
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:23,314
Otherwise if you see television,

418
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:27,274
you'll go mad like other television people are.

419
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:31,234
So what's the use of seeing the television?

420
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:35,034
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

421
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:39,114
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

422
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:43,314
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

423
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:48,714
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

424
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:55,914
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

425
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:58,274
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

426
00:26:58,474 --> 00:27:00,474
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

427
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:03,474
then you have to be like ganas

428
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:07,914
who go all out, and work it out.

429
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:11,194
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

430
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:13,072
which you can play on these people

431
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:15,193
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

432
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:18,194
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

433
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:19,754
You should not shun them.

434
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:23,154
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

435
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:26,754
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

436
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,674
You should write.

437
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:33,754
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

438
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,194
which are money-oriented

439
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:39,674
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

440
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:44,354
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

441
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:50,714
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

442
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:56,194
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

443
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:59,074
Try to now assert yourself.

444
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:00,714
Unless and until you do that,

445
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:05,634
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:08,714
You might get very great people out of that.

447
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,194
You can invite some people, you can call them.

448
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,514
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

449
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,554
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

450
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:20,714
as soon as they go to some house.

451
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:24,514
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

452
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:27,954
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

453
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:31,914
you can say a kind of a

454
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:37,994
negotiations, you can call it,

455
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:42,114
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

456
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,634
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

457
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:47,074
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

458
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:49,114
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

459
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,774
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

460
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:56,193
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

461
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:59,274
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

462
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:01,514
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

463
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:05,954
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

464
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,083
They would like to meet you. You should say:

465
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,993
"We found out this, we found out that."

466
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:13,754
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

467
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,154
you have to do this special work,

468
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:19,074
is to understand now you are matured enough,

469
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:21,474
you have to go in the society.

470
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:22,954
Now if you get upset,

471
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,926
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

472
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,154
It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:30,194
You are not going to be crucified,

474
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,274
you are not going to be murdered.

475
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:35,674
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

476
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:38,314
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

477
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:43,074
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

478
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:47,234
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

479
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:49,808
You are the marked people, who are going -

480
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:52,794
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

481
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,914
Why should you be afraid?

482
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,714
Why should you not meet people?

483
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:00,554
Then also I said, make some music.

484
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:02,993
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

485
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:05,569
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

486
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:12,234
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

487
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:17,234
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

488
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,914
but the message should be clear, it should not be

489
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:22,874
- I can never understand what they are singing.

490
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:25,794
So every word should be clear-cut.

491
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,634
We can go all out to have real publicity,

492
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:33,234
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

493
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,474
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

494
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:39,634
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

495
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:41,914
Also we should not say

496
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:44,634
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

497
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,834
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

498
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:50,474
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

499
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,954
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

500
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:56,474
where we can discuss about these things.

501
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,194
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

502
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,514
- morning time is always free -

503
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:05,314
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

504
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:08,354
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

505
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,238
And there you can discuss things,

506
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,679
how we can proceed, what we can do.

507
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,314
Now the time has come. It's over now,

508
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:18,954
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

509
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:22,234
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

510
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:25,994
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

511
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,994
"Now the doomsday has come.

512
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:30,994
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

513
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:35,874
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

514
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:40,074
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

515
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:43,714
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

516
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,514
Unless and until you take your realization,

517
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:51,274
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

518
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:54,714
All these genetic problems can be only solved

519
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,554
if you get your realization.

520
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:01,434
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

521
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:06,154
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

522
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:08,114
There are so many children in this world,

523
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,314
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

524
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:14,394
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

525
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:19,114
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

526
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,954
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

527
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:24,474
Before marriage

528
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:28,794
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

529
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,343
But if they are married, they kill their children.

530
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,113
So many people kill their children,

531
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,354
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

532
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,634
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

533
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:43,554
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

534
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:50,354
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

535
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:55,474
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

536
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,514
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

537
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:04,074
your nourishment that is needed.

538
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,234
You have to give love to everyone,

539
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,074
you have to care for everyone,

540
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,754
but you shouldn't get attached.

541
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:14,834
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

542
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:18,554
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

543
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:22,634
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

544
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,714
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

545
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:28,434
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

546
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:32,314
he came back, and they went away with him.

547
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:36,274
That shows you have not developed your personality.

548
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:40,994
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

549
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:44,914
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

550
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:49,754
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

551
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,754
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

552
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,114
but God has chosen you.

553
00:33:57,394 --> 00:34:04,114
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

554
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,874
In every aspect of life one should understand.

555
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,754
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

556
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,269
I don't want anything from you;

557
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,350
as it is you know how much I am spending.

558
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,274
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

559
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:21,474
you must go all out to help with money also.

560
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:25,394
People will, they spend money in, say, races

561
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:29,474
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

562
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:31,514
All that money is saved now,

563
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,954
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

564
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:38,394
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

565
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:41,034
Then another thing is, people just start asking

566
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:44,394
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

567
00:34:44,714 --> 00:34:49,154
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

568
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:53,314
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

569
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:55,674
How do you have this, say, tent?

570
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,674
How do you have this land?

571
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:02,034
How do you have Daglio?

572
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,952
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

573
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:10,193
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

574
00:35:10,314 --> 00:35:15,394
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

575
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:20,994
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

576
00:35:21,474 --> 00:35:25,394
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

577
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,314
It's giving no money at all.

578
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:31,994
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

579
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:36,474
And if you start saving money on that also,

580
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:39,674
then I don't know what to say to you.

581
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,154
It doesn't mean like

582
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:44,237
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

583
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:47,878
but your dedication.

584
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:51,074
If you have the dedication

585
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:55,274
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

586
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:58,116
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

587
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:00,072
Now school has to be built.

588
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:02,753
Who has built Vashi?

589
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,954
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

590
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:09,874
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

591
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:16,914
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

592
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,514
You all have prospered in life,

593
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:23,074
you all have got sufficient money,

594
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:27,754
but what are you doing?

595
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:35,554
So in this aspect is,

596
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:41,314
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

597
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:44,394
Another side is your creativity.

598
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:48,754
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

599
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,994
If they have to give any present

600
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:54,674
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

601
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:59,194
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

602
00:36:59,514 --> 00:37:01,394
If they could give even one piece like that

603
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:05,394
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

604
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:09,914
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

605
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,554
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

606
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:17,834
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

607
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,474
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

608
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:25,634
their programs and things can make some money.

609
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,874
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

610
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,794
Do you know we, I just asked once

611
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,314
that collect some money for Indian project,

612
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:38,674
one year, in Sahasrara.

613
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:39,914
You must know that,

614
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:43,714
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

615
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:47,474
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

616
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,754
in the bank.

617
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:52,634
How can you send five thousand to India?

618
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,874
What will they think of you?

619
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:04,554
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

620
00:38:06,794 --> 00:38:08,274
not for Indian children.

621
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:13,034
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

622
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:16,194
Thus we should realize

623
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:18,754
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

624
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:21,714
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

625
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:25,754
We should have some money for our organization.

626
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:29,514
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

627
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:31,434
that's very little amount;

628
00:38:31,674 --> 00:38:34,954
but still we are managing.

629
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:41,674
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

630
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:47,474
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

631
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,246
I don't need any money.

632
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:53,314
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

633
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:56,994
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

634
00:38:57,314 --> 00:39:03,274
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

635
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:06,394
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

636
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:09,554
but are you respectful like that?

637
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:14,634
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

638
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:18,434
Once, His Father said that

639
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,634
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

640
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:25,154
I'll give that person a present."

641
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:28,354
So another brother, Kartikeya,

642
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:33,714
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

643
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:36,354
was a peacock,

644
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:42,834
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

645
00:39:43,354 --> 00:39:45,794
and He could never have competed with Him.

646
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,074
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

647
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:49,834
She is the greatest of all.

648
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,914
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

649
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:55,302
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

650
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:58,114
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

651
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:02,474
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

652
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:10,034
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

653
00:40:11,394 --> 00:40:14,714
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

654
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:18,714
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

655
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:22,914
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

656
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:25,274
But despite that, try to understand.

657
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:29,354
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

658
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:34,074
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

659
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:37,554
that this is the Power sitting before you.

660
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:41,354
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

661
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:44,874
what we do, is all wrong.

662
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:49,074
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

663
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:52,194
that means kundalini has not come there.

664
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:57,034
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

665
00:40:57,434 --> 00:41:00,474
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

666
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,834
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

667
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:08,194
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

668
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:12,354
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

669
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,634
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

670
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:18,114
none of you have doubts about it.

671
00:41:18,314 --> 00:41:21,034
And not only that it's happening through Me,

672
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:22,754
but you also can do it now.

673
00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:27,474
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

674
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:34,354
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

675
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:37,194
I joke, I make fun,

676
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:42,914
I do everything just like a normal mother.

677
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:46,754
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

678
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,194
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

679
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:51,474
I must tell you: be careful,

680
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:54,667
you can't write rude letters to Me.

681
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:56,913
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

682
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:59,033
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

683
00:41:59,154 --> 00:42:01,873
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

684
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:05,954
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

685
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:09,794
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

686
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,394
you must understand this,

687
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:14,994
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

688
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,874
This side is, of course,

689
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:24,914
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

690
00:42:25,634 --> 00:42:32,674
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

691
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:36,954
Others may little bit hesitate,

692
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:40,234
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

693
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,114
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

694
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:46,954
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

695
00:42:48,114 --> 00:42:54,394
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

696
00:42:56,154 --> 00:42:59,634
because He has a parasha in His hand

697
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:04,234
and people get punished, no doubt.

698
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:09,394
So this is another thing one has to understand,

699
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:12,994
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

700
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:16,874
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

701
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:20,234
which you don't know.

702
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:26,034
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

703
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:31,954
But what is missing is the faith.

704
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:35,514
not blind but enlightened faith.

705
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:39,474
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

706
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:43,194
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

707
00:43:43,394 --> 00:43:45,474
he's an Indian

708
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:49,754
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

709
00:43:50,034 --> 00:43:51,474
- very good man.

710
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:56,074
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

711
00:43:56,994 --> 00:44:00,674
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

712
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:04,114
Some people tried to trouble him.

713
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:09,754
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

714
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:12,994
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

715
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:16,034
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

716
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:19,874
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

717
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:22,232
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

718
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:24,794
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

719
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:27,794
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

720
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:32,074
And still today they haven't got jobs.

721
00:44:35,994 --> 00:44:37,674
He said, "I had told you."

722
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,552
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

723
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:43,833
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

724
00:44:43,954 --> 00:44:47,274
But nothing works out now.

725
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:52,714
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

726
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:56,354
in Me, and in yourself.

727
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:58,647
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

728
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:01,554
how can they have faith in others?

729
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:06,834
This is another one thing you must understand,

730
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:10,674
that you have tremendous powers,

731
00:45:11,114 --> 00:45:14,194
tremendous powers if you have faith.

732
00:45:14,554 --> 00:45:16,674
You'll just pray,

733
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,945
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

734
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,464
or this lady to be cured."

735
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,874
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

736
00:45:23,114 --> 00:45:25,274
but your faith.

737
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:28,114
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

738
00:45:28,354 --> 00:45:30,474
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

739
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:33,314
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

740
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:38,514
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

741
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:41,474
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

742
00:45:41,674 --> 00:45:44,154
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

743
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:47,674
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

744
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,514
Why should I cure anymore?

745
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:53,434
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

746
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:56,994
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

747
00:45:57,274 --> 00:45:58,794
Just pray.

748
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:02,434
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

749
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:06,834
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

750
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,394
You have got that.

751
00:46:09,674 --> 00:46:14,354
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

752
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:16,634
But if you are not generous,

753
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:19,834
calculating each and every pai - finished.

754
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:22,154
Why should you?

755
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:25,274
The Lakshmi will serve you.

756
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:28,794
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

757
00:46:29,034 --> 00:46:30,794
He never bothered.

758
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:34,314
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

759
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:38,194
With human heads you should manage much better -

760
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:42,634
or do you need elephant heads?

761
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:47,634
Then another thing He has,

762
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:51,194
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

763
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:54,514
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

764
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:57,634
is the modoka He eats.

765
00:46:58,394 --> 00:47:04,834
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

766
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:07,354
which has got all these dry fruits

767
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:10,114
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

768
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:16,474
And that is one capacity He has,

769
00:47:16,954 --> 00:47:18,634
to eat;

770
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:21,354
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

771
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:23,554
But Mine is just the other way round:

772
00:47:23,794 --> 00:47:26,274
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

773
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:30,314
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

774
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:32,554
But He can eat well.

775
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:35,034
And whatever you eat,

776
00:47:35,274 --> 00:47:40,154
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

777
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:45,034
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

778
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:52,834
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

779
00:47:53,234 --> 00:47:56,074
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

780
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,634
I said, "All right."

781
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,394
As soon as we cooled it down,

782
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:02,474
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

783
00:48:02,794 --> 00:48:04,754
So He came with full force,

784
00:48:04,954 --> 00:48:06,114
He cooled it down

785
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:09,114
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

786
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:11,514
because there was no water in these streams.

787
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:16,074
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

788
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:21,434
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

789
00:48:21,994 --> 00:48:24,834
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

790
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:27,914
Even a little tent was not blown off.

791
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:31,634
It was all fun.

792
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:36,514
This is what is,

793
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:40,474
that you are also a testing ground for others.

794
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:43,074
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

795
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:46,554
You are so powerful.

796
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:50,914
Use your powers, use your powers.

797
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:54,674
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

798
00:48:54,954 --> 00:48:57,914
it's not pure. Attention is on other

799
00:48:58,114 --> 00:49:03,394
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

800
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,554
keep attention on Me.

801
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,434
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

802
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:12,274
He is there to work out everything for you,

803
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:16,114
His ganas are there to work out for you?

804
00:49:16,514 --> 00:49:20,474
So put your attention in such a way

805
00:49:20,714 --> 00:49:27,834
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

806
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:31,634
you know where is your attention going.

807
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:36,394
And then you see the attention how it works.

808
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:42,634
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

809
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:48,634
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

810
00:49:48,914 --> 00:49:52,074
how am I to give you certificate?

811
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:55,187
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

812
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:57,183
Like they say you have graduated.

813
00:49:57,304 --> 00:50:01,424
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

814
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:05,754
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

815
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:09,154
You are praveenas now.

816
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,394
"Praveen" means a master.

817
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:13,554
Use your mastery.

818
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:16,634
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

819
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:20,074
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

820
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,554
- you are a master.

821
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,114
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

822
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:32,074
is the master, you are also masters.

823
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:36,314
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

824
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,194
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

825
00:50:39,394 --> 00:50:43,474
and brickbats and all that, rise!

826
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:52,874
The another great quality of Him is that

827
00:50:53,154 --> 00:50:58,554
He uses His teeth to write.

828
00:50:58,754 --> 00:51:03,234
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

829
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:08,394
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

830
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,994
So He uses the teeth to write.

831
00:51:12,314 --> 00:51:15,714
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

832
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:20,394
So it is said that you must use

833
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:25,314
your brain

834
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:29,754
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

835
00:51:30,074 --> 00:51:33,274
and write, write, and write,

836
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:38,514
and produce it into books.

837
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:43,834
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

838
00:51:44,554 --> 00:51:47,834
And these books were read by people

839
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:50,114
and they were so much impressed,

840
00:51:50,314 --> 00:51:54,194
because anything black and white becomes something great.

841
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:57,234
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

842
00:51:57,474 --> 00:52:00,154
You can approach the televisions

843
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:02,754
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

844
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:06,554
Now think about going in to people,

845
00:52:06,954 --> 00:52:09,234
live in the society, live with them,

846
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:13,034
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

847
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:16,474
It's not only that but it is also,

848
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:20,434
it's a special privilege to you.

849
00:52:20,714 --> 00:52:24,914
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

850
00:52:25,154 --> 00:52:29,354
and I've tried to give you

851
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:31,874
some points about Shri Ganesh.

852
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:35,274
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

853
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:38,674
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

854
00:52:39,154 --> 00:52:42,634
So I hope you will understand the essential,

855
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:46,434
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

856
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:51,514
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

857
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:59,654
May God bless you all.
