1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:04,280
[UNCLEAR]

2
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,500
Yogi: Mother, [UNCLEAR] with the Italians.

3
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,600
What are your [UNCLEAR]? Even before realization,

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,340
I have a feeling that during this whole programme

5
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,340
there was certain attitude of respect.

6
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,260
Maybe two or three are useless but the group.

7
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,480
There was a kind of respect and they say, "Madre" and you know.

8
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,540
this kind of right attitude right away.

9
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,280
Yogi: Well, this is the place where the virgin Mary is most respected in the whole of Christian [UNCLEAR]

10
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,200
This is the place where [UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR] were.

11
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,780
Mataji: They may not [UNCLEAR] the church. Right?

12
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
There were [UNCLEAR]

13
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Yogi: That was the illusion of the church, much better than the Swiss.

14
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,800
They, they have lost their illusions of the church much better than the Swiss.

15
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
Mataji: They are [UNCLEAR] better.

16
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,020
And nobody objected.

17
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,740
Nobody objected.

18
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Yogi: And I was so amazed, they were so enamored by raising the kundalini Mother.

19
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,160
Mother, they were so happy to raise the kundalini, it was amazing.

20
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Mataji: I would say it was a very good achievement.

21
00:04:08,500 --> 00:05:11,660
 

22
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,480
In India, [UNCLEAR]

23
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 

24
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,880
 

25
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,400
they know how to respect the Goddess.

26
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:31,980
 

27
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,500
In India, [UNCLEAR] no once can [UNCLEAR] Mother.

28
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,880
 

29
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,500
[UNCLEAR] to say even.

30
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,100
very remarkable.

31
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,100
 

32
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,920
They [UNCLEAR] that to say something will not [UNCLEAR]

33
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,040
 

34
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:14,180
In India, [UNCLEAR] listen [UNCLEAR] where [UNCLEAR] No Mother,

35
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
[UNCLEAR] because

36
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
their sense of protocol is very clean.

37
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:32,200
 

38
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,020
Yogi: Therefore Mother, it is so important for us to go to India because we learn so much from them.

39
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,040
Yogi: Mother, if some people want to come to India, what do I tell them?

40
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,840
Yogi: If some people want to come to India, what do I tell them?

41
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
What about organization? How

42
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,880
Mataji: There have to be [UNCLEAR] three weeks.

43
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Mataji: From, we start from Bombay we go to [Vaitarna?]

44
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,000
From there we are going to [UNCLEAR] and all those places.

45
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 

46
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 

47
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 

48
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So now will be one week.

49
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
An soon it will be [UNCLEAR]

50
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,960
Yogi: Who should I contact Modi? Who has information?

51
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,900
 

52
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
[UNCLEAR] I am going to [write?UNCLEAR]

53
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,840
 

54
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,860
Mataji: Bombay to Pune only this time we are going to organize. We are not going to [UNCLEAR], only

55
00:08:02,860 --> 00:09:02,800
 

56
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,220
Mataji: 18th, they are all [UNCLEAR] there.

57
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
 

58
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Mataji: We are having weekly programs you see.

59
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,440
 

60
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,180
Yogi: Why will they stay in Bombay? Mataji: Not in Bombay.

61
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,400
Mataji: This time they are going to stay near Bombay, there is a place called Vaitarna.

62
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Mataji: Its [UNCLEAR]

63
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,300
There are some guest houses, [UNCLEAR], so we will privately go there.

64
00:09:44,300 --> 00:10:19,460
 

65
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,080
Yogi: I think the heart is more opening this [timeframe?]

66
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,440
It's more open than in Switzerland, than in UK also.

67
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,060
 

68
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Mataji: They are simpler people.

69
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:47,000
 

70
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In UK, people think that they are very clever.

71
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
I think the ego is not overdeveloped here.

72
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,480
Yogi: It is Mother but something Spiritual, I mean,

73
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,200
[UNCLEAR] Portuguese, Spanish are not also not so bad.

74
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,560
Ego is not so over developed.

75
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,420
Yogi: I have explained a bit to Ruth [UNCLEAR] came back from

76
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,420
the meeting

77
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,100
how it was in this Swiss German part of Switzerland.

78
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,660
And you came for the third time.

79
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
Unbelievable.

80
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Mataji: So did you [UNCLEAR] word I said?

81
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,740
Yogi: These girls call you Goodbye 
Mother. I love you, I mean,  nobody [like I know UNCLEAR]

82
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,800
Mataji:  [UNCLEAR] are the [UNCLEAR]

83
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:27,200
Yogi: Remember Mr. [UNCLEAR]?

84
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,520
I give him my poster like this one to him.

85
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,140
[UNCLEAR] the [UNCLEAR] of program down. But meditate [Christian UNCLEAR] fellow.

86
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,380
Mataji: All the souls are there, very [UNCLEAR]

87
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,200
Yogi: Mother, it's my prayer that

88
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,400
my sister and brother will bring

89
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,380
some of Mediterranean Italian art.

90
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Let's hope.

91
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,720
Sahaja yoga is very good.

92
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,700
[UNCLEAR] this is the problem.

93
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,480
They don't talk.

94
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,560
Just keep quiet, that's all.

95
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,420
But, now the protocol [is going to change UNCLEAR]

96
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,020
For me, [UNCLEAR] was such a problem.

97
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,580
Yogi: In India too, Mother, I know, in India.

98
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:55,280
Matai: But in America, to come all the way, to there, to see [UNCLEAR] it was very [bad? UNCLEAR]

99
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,900
Mataji: She said, as soon as you start your lecture

100
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,920
they go out, you see.

101
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,560
Mataji: You sit here like a Sahaja yogini [UNCLEAR]

102
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,900
Yogi: I remember

103
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
It was in Pune.

104
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Big all.

105
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,140
And the newcomers were in the middle and

106
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,120
sahaja yogis were around.

107
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,380
And so we were facing each other during the meeting.

108
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,320
And suddenly, I was just in front of Pamela and

109
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,820
[UNCLEAR]

110
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,240
Yogi: I don't know but

111
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
the wedding

112
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
at some point I spoke very loud, so that you should not shout.

113
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
Remember, when there was the sixteen petalled wedding?

114
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
And [UNCLEAR] was sitting near her

115
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
and she started speaking about me.

116
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
Saying, for who does he think

117
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
look how he shout?

118
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yogi: What did she say?

119
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,680
Yogi: That I was gross to shout like this.

120
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,040
and things like that,  I don't know why she mind.

121
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,500
Mataji: She must have been disturbed [UNCLEAR]

122
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,280
Yogi: Sometimes your answers are so sharp Mother.

123
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Chile people, really Mother?

124
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Mataji: They are from Chile, yes.

125
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,320
[UNCLEAR] things started operating.

126
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,460
Some Chilean family was there.

127
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,200
And from there, they shifted to

128
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,040
[UNCLEAR]

129
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,580
Mataji: Today they were telling me about [UNCLEAR] Chile people [UNCLEAR]

130
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,160
I know them.

131
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,360
[UNCLEAR]

132
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,760
They are very innocent people.

133
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,040
[UNCLEAR] so many people from Chile. [UNCLEAR]

134
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,200
So nobody knows [as to UNCLEAR] how many people were [killed?]

135
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,260
[UNCLEAR] people.

136
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,200
[UNCLEAR]

137
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,160
Actually, [UNCLEAR]

138
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
wife was to be [UNCLEAR]

139
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,120
[UNCLEAR]

140
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,620
 

141
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,600
[UNCLEAR] ladies also came at the [UNCLEAR]

142
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,180
China, [UNCLEAR]

143
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,940
Bandernaike

144
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,560
[UNCLEAR] in Israel.

145
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,460
I mean the funny characters.

146
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Yogi: He was quite funny.

147
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,260
Even I think.

148
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,700
Czechoslovakia [UNCLEAR] .

149
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,660
You know Czechoslavakia.

150
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,920
[UNCLEAR] 's wife

151
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,560
Mataji: Kennedy's wife.

152
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,680
[UNCLEAR] 's wife?

153
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,360
Mataji: I sent this [UNCLEAR]  such a nice big thing.

154
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,900
of Shiva and Parvati.

155
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,060
You have seen that.

156
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
in my house.

157
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Statue of Shiva and Parvati.

158
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,600
of [UNCLEAR]

159
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,620
That's what C.P wanted me to give him.

160
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,720
I sent it over.

161
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,360
[UNCLEAR]  is [coming?] to America next [UNCLEAR] ?

162
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,980
But Russian people are very good for realization.

163
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,600
[UNCLEAR]

164
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,640
Russian people.

165
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
Very good.

166
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,140
Very nice.

167
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
[UNCLEAR]

168
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,660
I went there.

169
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,120
With my husband.

170
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,080
[UNCLEAR]

171
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,940
Yogi: It is very sad that in the West we identify the Russians with the Government.

172
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,580
so [UNCLEAR]

173
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,160
Good people, very good people.

174
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,220
[UNCLEAR]  simple [UNCLEAR]

175
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,460
They have something [UNCLEAR] make in the church.

176
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,060
The kind of the freedom you have also

177
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,920
[UNCLEAR]

178
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,620
Even in this freedom, there is so much of [UNCLEAR]

179
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,420
In our freedom, now, in Switzerland,

180
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,920
Such a lot of hierarchy is there.

Hierarchy.

182
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
Isn't it?

183
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,800
So much of Hierarchy.

184
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,820
 

185
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,060
some five six families are controlling [the whole show UNCLEAR]  you see.

186
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,280
Money, this, that.

187
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,660
So, actually, man is not to be to understand evil.

188
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
And most things are [UNCLEAR]

189
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,540
The wait has gone just [asking UNCLEAR]  for God.

190
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,760
You know, worst, was, when I reached there that day

191
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
A man was crossing at the road.

192
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Another was going [UNCLEAR]

193
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,040
And the man was crossing the road as he was a little late or whatever it was.

194
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,540
The man in the car said something [UNCLEAR]  him

195
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,640
Immediately he turned back some words.

196
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,940
The man in the car took out his pistol and [UNCLEAR]

197
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,660
Yogi: When? Where?

198
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,300
Very violently.

199
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,820
Yogi: You saw that Mother?

200
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,360
No, no it was there in the newspaper.

201
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,200
Just about two streets away from where I was.

202
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,340
Yogi: And Mother, I tell you, we went to Miami.

203
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,460
with Maria and now they cannot go

204
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,000
out during the night because they are so

205
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,280
many crimes.

206
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,320
And it went up with all of these refugees from

207
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,300
South America, you know, now.

208
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,280
All the refugees of South America have

209
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,700
settled down in this part of the United States.

210
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,440
And criminality is so horrible.

211
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,780
Mataji: They are very hot tempered people.

212
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,060
The trouble is so.

213
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,180
Nodody is safe today.

214
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,800
Anybody can [UNCLEAR]  this boy Michael

215
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,140

with life. If you have

217
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
had not met me I would have just committed suicide.

218
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
I said, What happened? He said, His first cousin

219
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,420
killed his own mother.

220
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,800
in the [UNCLEAR]

[UNCLEAR]

223
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
Yogi: With 18?

224
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,900
Mataji: Eighteen, 1 8.

225
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,340
Mataji: So what is the [use UNCLEAR] of having so much freedom?

226
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,360
to become like this?

227
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,840
abandoned [UNCLEAR], you see, it's going too far.

228
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,400
Russians, are you see, they are underdeveloped even.

229
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,200
[UNCLEAR]

230
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,500
Both views are not good, but

231
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
to give freedom also, this happens.

232
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,840
If you don't give freedom that happens.

233
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,300
which [UNCLEAR]  to [UNCLEAR] ?

234
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,680
Yogi: But, the Russian will have to come

235
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,160
to the stage of America, in order to get the

236
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,120
[UNCLEAR]  of the seeker.

237
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,620
Mataji: They are seeking all right.

238
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,920
I talked to [UNCLEAR]

239
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,420
They sad, they have got everything.

240
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,460
But it's not satisfying.

241
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
There must be something in [New York?].

242
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,240
There is a direct [UNCLEAR] ?

243
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,980
Very surprising, isn't it?

244
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,240
In Russia, as she told me.

245
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,060
Of course America should come much faster.

246
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,860
But the idea we got about Russia,

247
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,320
which is not so horrid.

248
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
They cannot get realization?

249
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,540
I have [UNCLEAR]  intimacy from

250
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Yogi: About the things to Florence.

251

Thomas, because he felt so good with us, he want to go Germany today.

252
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,500
So tomorrow, there is a ... Thomas

253
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,660
could come to Florance but

254
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,360
[UNCLEAR]  too, so there are too many

255
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,740
people and I

256
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,720
asked if it would be possible

257
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,160
to take 2 cars

258
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,220
or is it expensive to hire cars for one day?

259
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,360
Mataji: Or what about the, we can go by train?

260
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,780
We can go by train and meet at a certain point.

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,080
to hire a car

264
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,540
on time, because

265
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,920
it's a three hour and a half drive.

266
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,780
So we have to start early tomorrow morning.

267

Yogi: Yes, but to see Florence with you Mother, it is to see Florence for the first time.

271
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,780
Mataji: We can get a bus or something.

272
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,280
Mataji: It's a small place or big place?

273
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,420
Yogi:  Well, Florence, I think the [UNCLEAR] one can walk really

274
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,260
No no, it's a bit too much.

275
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,160
Yogi: There is another solution, it is that we take

276
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
2 cars from here.

277
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,060
