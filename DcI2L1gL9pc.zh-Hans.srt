1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:09,238
Most of you are Sahaj Yogis here.

2
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:29,003
Now those who have got Realisation, those who have felt the vibrations,

3
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:37,487
must know that they are now developing into another being.

4
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:41,261
The germination has started,

5
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:49,597
and you must allow the germination to work out its own way.

6
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:59,892
But normally, when we get Realisation also,

7
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:08,843
we do not realise that it is a tremendous thing that has happened within us.

8
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:15,583
That this triggering, which is an impossibility, has taken place within us,

9
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:19,533
and it has to work out slowly.

10
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:27,473
It has to develop, and evolve us into that, and because we do not feel it,

11
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:33,173
we do not take it that seriously as we should, our Realisation.

12
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:41,723
Moreover, they are surrounded by people who have not felt the vibrations,

13
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:47,473
they do not know this area; they have never seen it.

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,643
As Guru Nanak has called it, it is alakshya (???????: unobservable).

15
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:55,763
They have not seen it, they don’t know about it,

16
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:02,573
they don’t know there is a power of God that exists,

17
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:09,593
which understands, coordinates, cooperates with you,

18
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:16,743
which is working in the collective being, which makes aware,

19
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:26,443
you aware of that collective being and of others also.

20
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:29,933
This alakshya, or we can call it paroksha (??????:invisible),

21
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:34,443
which is not seen by any one, which no one knows about, they talk about it.

22
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:41,773
They talk about the Kingdom of God, they talk about God’s Powers, Divine Power.

23
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:46,633
It’s all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

24
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:55,153
But once you are triggered into it, you have to grow into it.

25
00:02:55,162 --> 00:03:03,953
Unless and until you grow into it, you’ll be dropped,

26
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:09,473
specially for people who have come from fake gurus

27
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:14,473
and from false things that they have been following.

28
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:22,753
They don’t know how terrible these things are.

29
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:27,884
Like you are on a crocodile, and suddenly you discover it’s a crocodile:

30
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,903
how fast you would run from that?

31
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:37,753
But even the understanding that it is a crocodile and it is going to eat you off

32
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:41,823
doesn’t come up so easily.

33
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:22,333
So, this one doesn’t realise also, as you do not realise

34
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:26,023
that triggering which is the most difficult thing has happened to you,

35
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:30,375
it is difficult.

36
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:36,344
But it has happened to you, you know why it has happened.

37
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:42,623
You take that one for granted and also you take the devils for granted.

38
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:47,153
At least don’t take the devils for granted.

39
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,353
Run away from them as soon as possible.

40
00:04:50,362 --> 00:05:03,203
Meditate, meditate, and try to establish yourself, in the realm of Divine love.

41
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:06,473
I say it is Divine love.

42
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:10,243
You cannot understand what Divine love is.

43
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:16,013
You cannot understand any human being who loves you only for love’s sake.

44
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:25,583
Just because that person loves you, he goes on loving because he enjoys that loving.

45
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,253
In Sanskrit it is called avyaja (??????: natural; simple),

46
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:39,153
that there is no interest, avyaja, it’s just flowing.

47
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:47,493
Even when it corrects you, it corrects you in love.

48
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:59,470
And the protection of Divine love is the only way you are germinating.

49
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:05,835
That love gives you that warmth needed, that strength needed, that confidence needed.

50
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:14,543
Everything is given to you by that Divine love.

51
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,736
So, one has to realise

52
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:23,483
that it is love, and love, and love is the basis of all this Creation.

53
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:30,073
God has created this world, this universe, only because He loved.

54
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:36,803
And He wants to bestow this blessing on you because He loves you.

55
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:42,503
But how far you love yourself is the problem.

56
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:49,863
How far you understand yourself is the problem.

57
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:58,371
You do not evaluate yourself, and that is the reason why,

58
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:05,897
though the Kundalini has risen and you have got Realisation,

59
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:14,203
your vibrations are flowing, the growth is very slow.

60
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:22,833
Because attention has been outside, and even after Realisation it is outside.

61
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:28,443
Sometimes it is sucked in [but] again it goes outside.

62
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,173
Then we do not change our old habits at all.

63
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:36,083
We go on sticking to those old habits.

64
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:42,333
Our structure of life, our styles of thinking, continue to be the same:

65
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:52,560
again, we find ourselves lost into the same shambles.

66
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:57,123
Now SahajYog gives you Realisation, alright,

67
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:05,053
but also it gives you a long rope to hang yourself,

68
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:09,743
if you do not pay heed to yourself and to your being,

69
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:12,093
if you don’t love yourself

70
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:15,853
and understand that you are the instrument of God

71
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:23,073
by which for the first time you are going to give Realisation to people,

72
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,493
you are going to save people from getting drowned.

73
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:31,553
And this is the first time you are made like that.

74
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:37,994
This capability you never had and no human beings have, which you have got now today.

75
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,371
Very few people had this capability, very, very few people.

76
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:53,963
But now you have got that capacity and you do not want to evaluate yourself.

77
00:08:53,972 --> 00:09:00,793
How important it is, if you could realise,

78
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:05,893
then you would work it out [and] allow the blossoming to come up.

79
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:08,373
On the contrary I find [that]

80
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,653
today, because you are all Sahaj Yogis, I can talk to you like this.

81
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:15,875
Normally it is about Kundalini and all that, but I find that,

82
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,977
you do not see the movements of your Kundalini.

83
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:23,413
If you try to understand that She’s the one who loves you the most,

84
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:26,023
because She is your individual Mother.

85
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,353
And, if you try to follow Her,

86
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:30,983
you will see that She’s suggesting where is the problem with you,

87
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:34,073
what you have to correct, what you have to do.

88
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:37,223
Because She wants to perfect you.

89
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,243
She wants to help you.

90
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:45,603
So, if you start watching it, carefully, with love, with understanding-

91
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:54,453
She’s very playful, extremely sweet, full of beautiful plays like a little child.

92
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,414
She will tickle you here and there, call for your attention.

93
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,402
She doesn’t trouble you.

94
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:07,883
You have to be just alert about Her, and She really matures you.

95
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:12,973
You have seen people, with time, how they have matured.

96
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:20,993
But you have to pay attention to Her and to yourself,

97
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:26,873
otherwise what is your value, without enlightenment?

98
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:32,533
 What is the value of a human being without enlightenment?

99
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:36,233
 What is the use of having human beings if they are not enlightened?

100
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:40,283
 What is the use of this instrument if it is not put to the mains?

101
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:45,883
 The rest is all useless, isn’t it?

102
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,563
And it is you who have to raise the people.

103
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,993
You have to enlighten the people.

104
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:58,613
As we have some gas lights: a man runs up to the gas lights to lighten them,

105
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:02,063
he only has the power or capacity to do it.

106
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:07,923
So, he runs up the street, lightening all the gas lights.

107
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,953
It is he, here, who has to do it.

108
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:15,173
He is appointed for that.

109
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:25,253
Sahaj Yogis must realise what is their value.

110
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:27,743
What have you made out of Sahaj Yoga?

111
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,163
 How many people have you saved?

112
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,913
 How many people you have helped?

113
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,103
 Instead your own problems are so many

114
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:37,813
and you are creating problems for others by talking, by discussing, by arguing.

115
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,303
You cannot discuss it out.

116
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,433
You must know.

117
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,603
You cannot argue it out.

118
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:44,963
It has to work by itself.

119
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:52,203
By arguing, discussing, fussing, judging, confusing yourself,

120
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,583
you create a problem for your Kundalini to work it out.

121
00:11:55,592 --> 00:12:00,353
Are you not seeking your Spirit?

122
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:08,491
 Are you not worried about the salvation of your own Spirit?

123
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,171
 If so, what are you doing about it?

124
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:17,983
 That’s the most important thing.

125
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:27,773
I think everybody realises this, that only achieving Self-realisation is not the end of it,

126
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,483
because it’s just the sprouting that has started.

127
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,803
You have to go further.

128
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:35,553
You have to have compassion for others who haven’t got it yet.

129
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,303
You have to think about them,

130
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:40,343
you have to give it to them; work it out, put all your minds to it.

131
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:45,283
But still I find people are busy with other things.

132
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,683
They go back into the same circle.

133
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,503
You should be busy.

134
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:52,292
I don’t say that you should not do something for your living.

135
00:12:52,324 --> 00:12:56,143
You have to do it.

136
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:03,073
This is one thing very important for us to know, that we have to work it out.

137
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:07,283
We have to allow it to grow within ourselves.

138
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:10,203
But I mean if you say that, “Mother, we have all faith in you, that’s all.”

139
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,383
That’s not sufficient.

140
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:12,313
What faith do you have?

141
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,193
 What do you mean by faith?

142
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:14,713
 It is such a vague term.

143
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:18,573
What is faith after all?

144
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:22,443
Have you ever analysed the word ‘faith’?

145
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,973
 Some people think that, “We have all faith in Mother.

146
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:30,543
If we sing Her praise – finished!”

147
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:41,843
For that, one has to reach a certain stage, like AdiShankaracharya had reached.

148
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:44,693
Have you got faith in yourself?– is the point.

149
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:47,413
Who is having faith in me?

150
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:54,483
 Is the one who has no faith in oneself!

151
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:56,763
You have to have faith in yourself

152
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:06,963
and in all your fellow beings, all these other Sahaj Yogis.

153
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:14,573
Anybody who thinks that, “I am something greater than the others!” is a gone case.

154
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:17,883
Nobody should work Sahaj Yoga for oneself in that way.

155
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,843
You have to work collectively for every one of them.

156
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:25,883
Any one of you who thinks that you have something higher than the others have,

157
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,503
you are sadly mistaken.

158
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:31,333
It’s like one eye saying that, “I am higher than the other!”,

159
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,403
or one nose saying, “I am higher than the eyes!”

160
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:37,783
Everything has its own place in the body of Virata,

161
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:48,923
and everybody is so important, as well as dispensable.

162
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:53,103
You know what happens in Sahaj Yoga – very common in India, not so much here.

163
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:57,163
I mean Indians do this way: they have certain very good points like,

164
00:14:57,172 --> 00:15:01,513
I mean wherever I go I find them very much matured and very much developed,

165
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,573
because they are not such thinkers as you are.

166
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:07,443
You are great thinkers, visionaries, intellectuals, you see.

167
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:12,723
And I was thinking all the intellectuals will be developing a horn here like this after some time.

168
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:17,263
And when you see them, you’ll know that these intellectuals who are denouncing God

169
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:26,323
and denouncing all His ways, they are not intellectuals I would say, to that extent.

170
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:33,653
But they [Indians] fail in certain things, while you fail in certain things.

171
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:40,853
They always had this kind of thing where somebody came up like one man, who said,

172
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:41,973
“No, I am something great!”

173
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,143
Then, he says, “I am this, I am that!”

174
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:52,153
Goes on with this kind of harping, and he shows down other people.

175
00:15:52,162 --> 00:16:00,683
And then suddenly, such a person is brought down, and the people are shocked.

176
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,553
“Mother, how? What happened?” You cannot!

177
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,283
You see if you have to even pull a dead carpet like that,

178
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:11,353
you cannot pull one side of it, you have to carry the whole.

179
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:18,053
Only one person cannot shoot off in the whole game.

180
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:24,443
Now you take my position.

181
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:24,543
Yes, I know I have all the powers, everything is there, of course;

182
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:30,383
I am supposed to be much higher and all that – supposed to be, I should say.

183
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:45,023
But confronting you, I have to come down; I have to fight the way with you, up the hill.

184
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:48,813
Every step, we have to go together hand in hand.

185
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:52,863
You know that.

186
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:57,513
Somebody’s some chakras are catching so I put my Chakra into play.

187
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:03,293
It works out. It works out that way.

188
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:14,503
But you know how much I have to struggle, how much I have to work hard.

189
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:18,013
It’s a task, giving Realisation.

190
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:21,003
My Kundalini doesn’t need anything, you know that,

191
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:27,953
but still She has to carry your heavy Kundalini on Herself and raise it.

192
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:33,333
It’s a very heavy thing.

193
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:42,173
Only a Person of real love can do that, that’s the only criteria.

194
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:52,763
The one who does not have love, cannot do it [because] it is too much a thing to do –

195
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:58,773
the whole body vibrating, every centre vibrating; it’s not easy.

196
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:12,713
But it’s just the love, the compassion between you and me, which soothes me,

197
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:19,773
which covers all the tasks and the labour and the thing that I have to put in.

198
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:23,823
And sometimes it’s such a wasteful thing I feel about some people.

199
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:26,433
It is such a waste with them.

200
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:38,021
But still the love that has brought us together gives that soothing feeling

201
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:40,228
and you feel so cheerful.

202
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:53,068
Every morning you get up with a new fragrance within yourself, feeling so happy about it.

203
00:18:53,102 --> 00:19:00,443
So be careful in dealing with people, you have to deal with love,

204
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:07,593
not with criticism or in any way showing them down in any way.

205
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:15,813
When you are not any way higher than anyone then there is no reason it should be done like that.

206
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,553
If you are getting any way higher, you are helping the Collective Being.

207
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:23,383
But in that, if you are feeling that you are higher than others you are again coming down

208
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,083
because you are pulling down the Collective Being.

209
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:37,003
If you put down anyone, or condemn anyone like that, then you are putting down that person.

210
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:43,179
And, you should not also correct, because I am there to correct.

211
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:46,854
It’s not easy to correct others, you may hurt them.

212
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,283
You don’t know even the ways of correcting people.

213
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,783
Unless and until you have those powerful vibrations,

214
00:19:52,792 --> 00:20:01,293
which are emitting from your being just love, then you can do it.

215
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:07,273
Because of an ego-oriented society we are very good at hurting others.

216
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:11,803
We dominate others.

217
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,913
We don’t even know that we are dominating others.

218
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:18,563
There are so many ways I have learned in this country we have,

219
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:23,833
by which we dominate, in a very subtle way.

220
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:32,533
We talk to people, in such a way that we are dominating them.

221
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,703
Do we ever think, sit down,

222
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:40,373
how are we going to talk to others, suggesting our love to them?

223
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:44,833
I’ll tell you again and again that SahajYog is nothing but love, love, love.

224
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:48,613
How much you love others is the main point.

225
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:54,533
Despising, criticising, is not good.

226
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:58,213
Yesterday, you were just the same, today you are better off,

227
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,733
you are going to be better off still.

228
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,843
Of course, some people who are very heavy,

229
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:04,815
who are very troublesome, you should tell them plainly that:

230
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:11,033
“Sorry sir, you are very negative, we can’t bear you.”

231
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:18,403
There are some cunning people also who may come in and try to trouble you.

232
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:23,073
To a point is all right, then you have to tell them off that: “We are sorry.”

233
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:27,483
But even to judge whether a person is negative or what sort of a thing he is doing,

234
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:30,413
you are just thinking about it, you are rationalising –

235
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:37,123
not through rationality, but through vibrations.

236
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:41,173
Because rationality, a person may appear to be a very nice person, may be,

237
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:48,090
or a lady coming in, see, and the lady will be a terrible stuff.

238
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:58,913
So how much you meditate means how much you love.

239
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,873
When you think of others, think how much you love them,

240
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:07,955
just try to think how beautiful it is.

241
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,773
If it is not love, it is hatred.

242
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,993
It’s like a scorching heat you see,

243
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:30,923
which will completely take away all the beauty, the smoothness, of your heart.

244
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:37,203
Only through love, Sahaj Yoga is going to spread.

245
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:43,613
All these years you have seen the powers of hatred.

246
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:50,713
You have seen how people hate, how they talk about each other, how they treat each other.

247
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:58,323
There’s no tenderness about them, there’s no kindness about them,

248
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:05,613
how sharp they are with each other.

249
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:07,633
You have to change all that now.

250
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:14,493
You have to create a world of people who love each other, for nothing:

251
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:23,971
not for money, not for positions, not for beauty, not for sex, only for love’s sake,

252
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:35,842
only because you have been blessed by love.

253
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:40,201
From next time we’ll be advertising and there will be many more coming

254
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,820
who are new people to Sahaj Yoga.

255
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,993
And I am sure it is going to increase.

256
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:48,756
But I have told you that all of you must find out

257
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:54,203
how many people you can bring in yourself and work out.

258
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:56,673
I must say Jim has done a good job, very good job.

259
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,103
I’m very proud of him.

260
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:01,693
He has gone and done such a lot of things,

261
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:04,279
and single-handed he has worked it out,

262
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:09,993
fighting such a horrible monster there, but he’s done it.

263
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:14,643
All of you must support him, and also such people who want to do something.

264
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,233
Put your mind to something like that.

265
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:21,083
All the time we are thinking about jobs, this, that, that.

266
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,313
This is a very precious time which should not be lost.

267
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:32,973
All our lives we have done jobs, earning money, marrying, having children and dying.

268
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:41,203
This lifetime, let us do something special, for which this whole universe was created.

269
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:49,043
Open the gates of heavens for the rest of the people.

270
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,433
You have to be assiduous.

271
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:54,553
There’s no compulsion in Sahaj Yoga you know that very well.

272
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:58,133
There’s no timing for it.

273
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:02,503
There’s no forcing for it, because I say it is love.

274
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:08,003
If you do not want to do it, nobody is going to force you.

275
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:14,303
But, as I said, Sahaj Yoga gives a very long rope to hang yourself,

276
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,186
till you go into illusions completely

277
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,234
and you wouldn’t even know that you have lost all your vibrations.

278
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:29,853
It is to that extent.

279
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:36,953
If we have entered into something which was unprecedented,

280
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:41,623
we have to take the ways which are unprecedented.

281
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,603
You cannot go about with the ways that you have had before.

282
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:51,983
You have to change your methods.

283
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:56,503
Judge every action of yours through love.

284
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:59,103
How much sacrifice can you make for others?

285
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:01,343
 What can you sacrifice for others?

286
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,313
 What service can you do for others?

287
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:06,353
Sahaj Yogis I am saying.

288
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:08,523
There is no sacrifice in it.

289
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:13,843
If you see it, what is the sacrifice? It is love.

290
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:20,383
If you love someone, and you want to take, say, a rose for a person,

291
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:24,353
and you go to the market, with great difficulty you get the rose.

292
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:26,173
When you get it you feel happy.

293
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:30,815
But then you get the thorn in the finger, still you don’t mind.

294
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,719
It’s bleeding, doesn’t matter.

295
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:36,193
Then you are just waiting to see the person there.

296
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:42,583
And when you see the person, you forget all that is gone in between

297
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:48,743
and you give that rose just to express yourself, symbolically.

298
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:52,753
And how happy you feel that you have been able to give that rose to that person.

299
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:56,263
This we do every day in our life.

300
00:26:56,272 --> 00:27:04,793
But in Sahaj Yoga you do it without even knowing it – it’s happening.

301
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:06,533
You are transmitters.

302
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,853
Everywhere you are sitting in meditation you are transmitting vibrations.

303
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,363
Do you know that?

304
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:17,513
 At that time if you are thinking of your jobs and your other things

305
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:23,953
which you have been thinking [about] before, the transmission is poorer.

306
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:30,433
Think of love, think of the whole country, think of the whole world at that time.

307
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:39,573
You are transmitters of these waves of love, and love will flow from you.

308
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:45,893
I told you once that you are made in the form of Ganesha,

309
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,863
and that’s what you have to do.

310
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:53,733
You know there are vibrations from you coming out,

311
00:27:53,742 --> 00:28:01,603
you are sending vibrations out, you know that.

312
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:10,921
That means you are like any deity which is thrown out of the Mother’s,

313
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:18,013
I mean Earth’s womb, and a big temple is raised,

314
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:22,993
and thousands of people go to worship that.

315
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:31,567
And they say it is a temple of a JagrutDevata.

316
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:37,644
‘Jagrut’ means enlightened, awakened.

317
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:45,993
And that’s just a stone, a stone that comes out and people build a temple on top of that

318
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:50,533
and go there and worship that.

319
00:28:50,542 --> 00:29:00,083
While there are so many already sitting here, so many jagrut, realised-souls.

320
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:12,183
These are living, these are moving, these are understanding, they manoeuvre.

321
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:20,073
The stones only emit vibrations to clear the atmosphere, but you can raise the Kundalini.

322
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:22,833
They cannot raise the Kundalini; you can.

323
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,983
And what are you doing about it?

324
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:26,833
 Such a precious thing you have got.

325
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,073
What are you doing about it?

326
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:38,223
 Is it because there is no business with it that we are taking it so slowly?

327
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:43,113
 Supposing it’s an enterprise then everybody would be up and doing, is it?

328
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:46,633
We have to change our ways and methods of understanding.

329
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:56,383
The reward of God is thousand-fold than any enterprise can bestow upon you.

330
00:29:56,392 --> 00:30:08,263
When He blesses you, you wouldn’t even have words to thank Him, to that extent He goes.

331
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:16,743
Are we depending on Him or on our own old ways?

332
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:18,263
 We have to change very much;

333
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:22,963
we have to transform ourselves into new style of thinking.

334
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:28,993
It is very, very important.

335
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:40,653
I hope you’ll think about it, what I have talked to you today.

336
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:48,893
Don’t take to life which has not brought any happiness to you.

337
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:51,853
You have your friends who are Sahaj Yogis.

338
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:54,143
Change your friends.

339
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,213
Change your methods of life.

340
00:30:56,222 --> 00:31:03,061
You’ll enjoy much more.

341
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:17,217
This is for you to understand about yourself and about the importance of Sahaj Yoga.

342
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:21,323
Unless and until it is an enterprise, nobody takes it up seriously.

343
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:26,733
This is the style of Western thinking.

344
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:31,393
It has to be, whether it is hocus-pocus or real enterprise,

345
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:38,413
doesn’t matter, as long as there are money exchanges, everybody is up and doing.

346
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:45,918
But when it comes to Sahaj Yoga they have no time even to meditate.

347
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:57,113
Because we have not yet loved, we have not felt that love within ourselves.

348
00:31:57,122 --> 00:32:00,958
I wish you could all feel that depth of love.

349
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:12,792
Then you would go all out to work it out for yourself and for others.

350
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:16,463
I would like to have some questions from you, Sahaj Yogis, if possible.

351
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:27,332
But somebody should try to give him, he can get it in no time, Realisation.

352
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,869
Is there any question?

353
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:31,363
 Ask me – anything practical.

354
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:37,973
Because we have very few new people today, we can just have a very nice chat.

355
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:41,493
Lady: Would you explain to me about sometimes,

356
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,923
when people say if you put your legs out like that it’s just not good

357
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,293
and you should have them underneath– what’s wrong?

358
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:48,483
 I mean if it’s not a sexual tantalisation or something,

359
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:53,563
what’s wrong with having your legs just stretching out in front of you?

360
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,603
Shri Mataji: In front of me?

361
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:55,433
 Will you do to the Queen?

362
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:56,303
Lady: No, no, I’m sorry.

363
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:59,133
Shri Mataji: No, no, what I am saying, will you do to the Queen of England?

364
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,143
Lady: No, no.If you are alone, now what happens?

365
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:01,983
Shri Mataji: Hum?

366
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,343
Lady: I don’t mean if somebody’s there.

367
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:07,743
Shri Mataji: Before my photograph? Will you spit at?

368
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:08,773
Lady: When you sit to meditate.

369
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:13,843
Shri Mataji: No, no, what I’m saying if your Queen’s photograph is there, will you spit at her?

370
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:14,763
Lady: Is that a spit?

371
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:16,683
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is! It is an insult.

372
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:19,123
Putting your feet towards somebody is an insult.

373
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:20,983
Is a common thing!

374
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:23,033
Lady: Is it only a custom in India?

375
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,863
Shri Mataji: No, no, it is a custom everywhere in the whole world.

376
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:27,683
You have lost all your traditions,

377
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:31,413
doesn’t mean that there were no such traditions of putting away feet on somebody.

378
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:33,683
Imagine, somebody coming down to see you,

379
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,553
somebody whom you have to respect, you put your feet up?

380
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:40,613
 I mean, anybody can understand, even a child understands this.

381
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:45,233
You see the sense of our respect has come to us from inside, not from outside.

382
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,213
It’s not rationality.

383
00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:49,753
It has come to us from our unconscious.

384
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,633
We know how we respect.

385
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:55,543
Say somebody would say that, “What’s wrong in talking like this to someone?”

386
00:33:55,552 --> 00:33:59,303
You see, supposing somebody says, now you know that, even a child knows,

387
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:02,723
if he is talking to elders, he’ll put down his head.

388
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:04,623
But here, you see everybody is so abnormal.

389
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:09,153
You don’t know how to do everything because everything is rationalised, you see.

390
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:11,813
Tomorrow, you might say, “What’s wrong if I stand on my head?”

391
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:14,333
I mean, “Do it”, but that’s not the way.

392
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:18,213
There are certain normal ways of protocol, of praying.

393
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,373
How do you pray in the church?

394
00:34:19,382 --> 00:34:22,673
 Imagine, in the church you go and sit with both your feet towards the priest.

395
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:23,253
What will he say?

396
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,953
 “Put down your feet!”

397
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,523
These things are innate within us.

398
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:32,103
Human beings know already lots of things.

399
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,133
They are not animals.

400
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:35,703
They know lots of things already.

401
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:38,383
You don’t know how many things are built in you.

402
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:46,553
In a very beautiful way in your understanding, as a human being, you know so many things.

403
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:51,353
Nowhere in the world you’ll find anybody putting up their feet before anyone whom you respect.

404
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:54,953
It’s not a sign of respect.

405
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,953
There’s no question of India or anything.

406
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:02,843
Only thing in India, people have yet preserved all their sense of respect.

407
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:06,323
In other places, they have so rationalised and so ego-oriented

408
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:10,243
that they have no respect for anyone whatsoever.

409
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,633
Lady: You take it only as a sign of respect.

410
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:16,373
Supposing that somebody is sitting alone and they don’t have Your picture

411
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:19,553
or they don’t have anything, is it all right to stretch their legs?

412
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:22,713
Shri Mataji: Then it’s all right.I mean, you see it is.

413
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:27,623
Lady: Somebody said that if you put your legs out it’s creating some bad energy or something.

414
00:35:27,632 --> 00:35:28,373
That’s why I wanted to check.

415
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:31,083
Shri Mataji: No, no not that way, not losing energy.

416
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:34,883
I was just thinking about stretching the feet before somebody whom you respect.

417
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,913
Say, my Photograph is there or I am there.

418
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:38,543
Now, you respect me.Isn’t it?

419
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,363
 Then you will not like to sit with the feet.

420
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,843
That’s what I’m trying to say.

421
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:45,243
But, you see, losing energy and all that is not there at all.

422
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,083
Who told you that? That’s not.You sleep like that.

423
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:51,063
You don’t sleep with the feet on the ground.How can it be?

424
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,843
 If anybody says that, you should not take it for granted.

425
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:59,363
You see I think all this is not so important also.

426
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,163
Even you sleep, how do you sleep?

427
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,843
 I mean, it is so simple and natural.

428
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,523
You know this is what’s happening with rationality.

429
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:09,283
See, very simple things become so funny that you, I don’t know what to say.

430
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,813
That’s why I said a horn will be growing from here, all of you intellectuals.

431
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:15,333
You’ll be having a big horn coming out so people will know,

432
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,793
“All right, all right, we know these people.”

433
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:22,363
Nobody will face them.You see, this so simple.

434
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:26,133
Because you are so complicated, all simple things look so horrid.

435
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,903
Is a question of respect and is a question of –

436
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,613
if you are sleeping, of course you stretch your feet like that, straight.

437
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,993
It’s all right.

438
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:36,173
While you sit down, you can sit like that, there’s no harm.

439
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:38,333
You need not be cross-legged all the time.

440
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:39,283
It’s not necessary.

441
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:44,923
If you are doing some sort of a exercise or something, you can be like that.

442
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:48,493
But everything, now say, for example, you have got hands.

443
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:50,843
Now this is for many purposes, all right?

444
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:54,963
 It is for taking vibrations, it is for eating, it is for scratching.

445
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:59,263
Now, if you are eating at that time if you want to scratch, now what to do?

446
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,983
 It’s a question like that.

447
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:07,493
See whatever you have to do, you do at that right time, with the way you want to do.

448
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:11,633
If you need your feet for something – running, you should run.

449
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:14,243
When you have to sit down, you should sit down.

450
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:16,183
When you have to sleep you must sleep.

451
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,533
I mean this is normal.

452
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:23,063
Sahaj Yogis does not mean that you should cut your noses.

453
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,863
No, it doesn’t mean that.

454
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:29,713
It means you have to be more beautiful.

455
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:33,383
It doesn’t matter, you see even if you bend ten times,

456
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:37,723
but it does matter if you pull back yourself, even once.

457
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:47,103
Doesn’t matter, to be humble, to be more humble and more humble, is so sweet and good.

458
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:52,803
You see, makes you more cultured, more harmonious and beautiful.

459
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,883
Man: I have a problem.

460
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:56,903
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

461
00:37:56,912 --> 00:38:10,883
Man: I’ve been, in my humble way, devoted myself, to the spiritual realisation of myself,

462
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:18,233
I adopted meditation, I completely lost number of years.

463
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:23,083
I realised that state in subtle awareness

464
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:30,313
and I feel myself highly elevated from this material world,

465
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:36,093
the feeling of bliss, absolute peace, happiness and joy.

466
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:42,523
And, I see the Spirit which I construct upon in a very glorious, boarded way,

467
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:45,483
in a boarded, shut boarded way.

468
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,943
That state continues for some time,

469
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:52,493
but doesn’t stay for a long time, for a long number of days.

470
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:56,313
After a short time again I find I come down.

471
00:38:56,322 --> 00:39:05,863
And this goes like a curve, and when I find that from the height I have come down,

472
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:09,583
I feel a little disturbed, why it is happening.

473
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:16,003
And, I have found that the more I detach myself from my family,

474
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:22,393
from my work, from my friends, from other things, the lighter I feel

475
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:30,933
and the greater number of peace I get from meditation.

476
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:33,523
Now, the trouble is this.

477
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:41,443
About one year ago, when I would see a beautiful girl, a beautiful lady,

478
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:48,693
I would remain restless perhaps for two days, three days or something like that.

479
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:51,643
When I learnt about Patanjali’s yoga –

480
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,453
Shri Mataji: What yoga is this?

481
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:54,493
Man: Beg Your pardon?

482
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:55,623
Shri Mataji: What yoga are you doing?

483
00:39:55,632 --> 00:40:00,153
Man: Now, I’m just saying that now, I’m perfectly all right.

484
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:04,453
Shri Mataji: What was that you did? What yoga did you do?

485
00:40:04,462 --> 00:40:10,393
Man: Well, as a matter of fact, I’m not following any yoga as such

486
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:12,353
but I have studied Patanjali.

487
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:14,213
Shri Mataji: Patanjali, all right.

488
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:19,503
Man: And, then when I met … Now the concern is this: that attraction

489
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:23,403
which I used to have some time back is eliminated.

490
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:31,443
But still, I do find a stern will within myself, to maintain that state of mind

491
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:35,273
which gives me lot of bliss, for that moment it disappears,

492
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,803
and then again I revert to that.

493
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:42,433
That is my personal problem.

494
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,223
I think I’ve tried to be very open.

495
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:46,743
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, that’s correct.All right.

496
00:40:46,752 --> 00:40:50,623
Now, the first thing is what chakras are catching?

497
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:51,503
Man: Left Swadishthana.

498
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:53,003
Shri Mataji: That’s it.

499
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:58,793
Now see, to do Patanjali was a mistake in the very beginning.

500
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:01,483
As a Mother, I must tell you frankly, all right?

501
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:07,263
 Because Patanjali cannot be done unless and until you have some realised guru behind it.

502
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:11,123
If you start doing it, it is unauthorised, you see.

503
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:13,543
It is an unauthorised thing to do.

504
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:19,683
Like, supposing I am not a policeman,all right?

505
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:24,143
and I start behaving like a policeman, I’ll be arrested.

506
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:28,083
In the same way, you did it in an unauthorised way.

507
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:35,313
By doing in an unauthorised way you have started in the wrong direction altogether.

508
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:37,163
The direction was wrong.

509
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:43,413
And the bliss and all that you get it, is not the bliss that we are talking about.

510
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:48,753
That’s a bliss one gets when you shirk responsibility, you can get it.

511
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:52,213
You see, if you can get out of your family and children and all that,

512
00:41:52,222 --> 00:42:00,483
one can feel blissful if he thinks that it is having a sort of a pressure on you

513
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:03,983
or a kind of attachment or something.

514
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:13,883
But in Sahaj Yoga what happens is that you become a personality when you are in the drama

515
00:42:13,892 --> 00:42:15,933
but you are just seeing it.

516
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:18,863
You become a sakshi (witness).

517
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:22,113
That should happen.That’s the reality.

518
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,133
That’s how it should happen.

519
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:26,703
Once it happens to you, then you will just start seeing the whole thing as a drama.

520
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,173
Man: Yes.

521
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:31,953
Shri Mataji: You understand?

522
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:35,473
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

523
00:42:35,482 --> 00:42:42,083
Sahaja Yogi: He feels a slight cool breeze.

524
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,433
Shri Mataji: He is getting.Yes, he is a realised-soul.

525
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:50,923
Yes, he got Realisation.He got it.

526
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:59,393
What about this gentleman here, in front of you Marcus?

527
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:01,313
Question: (inaudible)

528
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:08,643
Shri Mataji: So, it should happen in the most natural way, in a spontaneous way.

529
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:13,673
And, God has given you that ankura which is called as Kundalini, which of course you know.

530
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:16,333
Kabira and all these people have talked about.

531
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:20,853
But it is a Sahaj method, it just happens to you, with a realised-soul only.

532
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:22,723
You cannot do it yourself.

533
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:25,793
If you try to do it, you will be making a mistake.

534
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,123
And that’s what has happened in you.

535
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:33,033
So now we have to completely sort of neutralise the effects of that.

536
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:36,713
And then we’ll raise your Kundalini by which you’ll get your Realisation,

537
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:40,223
by which, gradually you will get your vibrations, and you’ll start understanding.

538
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:40,983
All right?

539
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:45,583
So, you just now forget about what you have done, and it’s going to work out.

540
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:50,203
Then it’s a permanent thing.

541
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,303
What about his vibration Marcus?

542
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:54,893
Marcus: Vishuddhi.

543
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:58,163
Shri Mataji: Left or right?

544
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:01,783
You’ve got your Realisation is it?

545
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:03,323
 I’m asking him.

546
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:04,293
Other man: Yes.

547
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:07,873
Shri Mataji: Is it all right? There’s a catch on the left is it?

548
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:12,833
 Are you feeling something? You get what?

549
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:14,873
Other man: I have a slight pain on my leg.

550
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:25,033
Shri Mataji: Hmm.Anybody who has any problems about chakras, anyone of the Sahaj Yogis,

551
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:30,923
anybody who has any problem about their own chakras, please ask me.

552
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:33,863
Because next time we’ll be having lots of people here,

553
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:39,033
 then we won’t be able to talk, so better ask me about it.

554
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:41,103
Dinesh what is your problem?

555
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,593
Dinesh: My problem? Hmm.

556
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:48,533
Shri Mataji: Agnya.I can see that clearly, from here.

557
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:49,773
You have to forgive people.

558
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:54,773
Do you understand that?

559
00:44:54,782 --> 00:45:02,493
Forgive, and forgive.

560
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:07,502
What about her vibrations? Now just see.
