1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,780
It is that you apply a mixture of turmeric and oil and all that to the body to the boy first and then is applied to the girl.

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,720
They feel better on the body and on the face, they feel soothed down. Its a kind of a jubilant thing, now they are in for marriage, now painted for marriage you can say.

3
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,740
They are not supposed to talk to anyone

4
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,200
They have to keep to themselves and to be very very quietly settled down.

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,700
This function has to be done.

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,380
For the girls who are to be married, will you please get up and come round here.

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,000
The girls who are to be married, all the girls

8
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,260
Now, this thing is a turmeric, another thing mixed together.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,200
And this may spoil your sarees a little bit, so

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bring one towl and were very simple clothes, you see, you may just wear a saree and a blouse, you may not have the inner clothes.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,820
You can just come down there, and someone will apply this to you, or you can sit there at one side

12
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,940
Then you have to go for a bath, to arrange for the bath now

13
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Where are you?

14
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Just come this side

15
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,980
Now

16
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,080
You first go from here so we will have to apply this to the boys first.

17
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
Now those boys who are going to get married, should come forward.

18
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,080
With great courage.

19
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,860
Now all your clothes are going to be spoilt

20
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
and bring a towl, and wrap it and sit down with a towl

21
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,540
so best thing would be that you change your dresses and bring a towel

22
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,180
Go go go all of you, just bring a nice big towl, so that you cover yourself. All these clothes have to be taken,

23
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,680
I am sorry, you have to be in your birthday suits.

24
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,100
This has a very secret thing you see

25
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,780
If the boy is suffering from any disease or anything you can see on the skin of the boy

26
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,100
So this system also helps a person to find out, if there is such a problem that exists.

27
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,400
There is quite a lot of things in it, and apart from that if he has any skin troubles, because

28
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,240
it is an auspicious day, if some ordinary skin trouble then also application of this soothes his skin so

29
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,060
it has a double purpose, but if he has some bad skin  trouble I mean something comes from a very dirty disease or something

30
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,700
that shows on the skin, so the people know about it.  Of course these boys are healthy, but I am saying in general.

31
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,660
And the boys who are not getting married should go move backwards, otherwise they will also be.

32
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,540
Everybody must know that there clothes are going to be a little bit spoilt so be careful.

33
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
No no no you are not alright, you don't have a big thing

34
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,020
some big sheet or something?

35
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,420
Go wrap yourself completely with a sheet and come back.

36
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,360
All this is going to be spoilt.

37
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
Put a nice sheet around, tell them to put a big nice sheet around

38
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,920
So now when the disturbed people have gone, we can talk to something else

39
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,240
..James is it alright for you? Its alright for me, yes. What she said?

40
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
we talked a little bit, but she went off to the home with the other people , please come and talk to me

41
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,820
no no no this is nothing, you better come in sheets, take out all this

42
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,420
we have not had any talk, these people have appeared ..

43
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,380
very very you see crazy husbands

44
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,240
In Marathi there is a saying

45
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,280
means that .. is the one that is to be tied here

46
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,500
he is so in a hurry to get married that

47
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
he is putting it up to his knees

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Now they are walking with anything they can get a hold of, they must have rushed

49
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,100
there

50
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,580
good good good

51
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,080
looking like Romans I think

52
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Alright, now these are good

53
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,400
what's that? oh you must dress up with something more

54
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,560
you don't have something here? your pant will be spoiled.. you don't mind?

55
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,940
doesn't matter, then its alright..

56
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,100
you are just suited for each other

57
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 

58
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,460
Rajneesh is too short for you

59
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,520
its better that

60
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
