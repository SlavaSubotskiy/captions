1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,530
I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the
very outset we have to know that truth is

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,220
what it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot
mold it. Also we cannot know it at the stage

3
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:37,340
when we are human beings, with human awareness
we cannot know it. So we have to become a

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,420
super human being, a higher personality. What
is said that you have to be the Spirit, you

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,480
have to be the Self. In all the scriptures,
in all the religions it has been said that

6
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:03,909
you have to be the Spirit. I mean we see the
turmoil and the problems of the world that

7
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:13,229
are completely show us clearly that there
is so much of a mess and most of them are

8
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,799
the problems created by human beings. We have
to do some introspection and some soul searching

9
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,250
and we have to find out, after all, why we
human beings have created all these problems

10
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,490
for ourselves. We have had philosophies, we
have ideologies, we have so many kinds of

11
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,750
enterprises but despite that there are so
many differences and the differences are having

12
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,020
larger and larger gaps. If it is the truth,
it has to be the truth for everyone. Everyone

13
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:14,869
has to say: "This is The Truth". But it has
to be the Absolute Truth. If it is not the

14
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,090
Absolute Truth then what we believe into is
not the reality. And this is the main reason

15
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,530
why everything in the name of God, Divinity,
everything has failed so far because it is

16
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,190
not substantiated by reality.

17
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,190
First we must feel the reality. And what is
the reality, and what is the truth? The truth

18
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,560
is that you are the Spirit, you are the pure
Spirit. And that there is All Pervading Power

19
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,239
of divine love which does all living work.
Now we see all these beautiful flowers, beautifully

20
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,370
arranged, everything, but we never think how
so many flowers have come out of one seed.

21
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,370
How it has worked? This living work is done
by whom? We will say: "The Mother Earth".

22
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,500
But the Mother Earth seems to be just... just
a thing... it is just a matter. Than how these

23
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,510
flowers have sprouted from a little seed,
who has done this work? We don't even think

24
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:45,510
who has done the job of making us human beings
from ameba stage. So for a hypothesis let

25
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,180
us think there is something, some power that
is doing it. As scientists you must keep your

26
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:04,459
minds open. There is no use having blind faith
in Me, in Sahaja Yoga, in anything because

27
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,890
blindness will never give you reality. But
you should be open like scientists are and

28
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:20,340
whatever hypothesis I am putting before you,
you have to feel it on your central nervous

29
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,250
system.

30
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,250
This is what is the Bouddha, is what is Buddha
preached about that you have to feel the All

31
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,650
Pervading Power on your central nervous system.
And the time has come. Time has come for all

32
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,110
of you to feel that. You all can feel that
All Pervading Power, the power of the Holy

33
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,199
Ghost, power of the Primordial Mother. And
then, once you are in connection with that,

34
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,190
like this instrument when it is connected
to the mains it has a meaning, your self-knowledge

35
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,190
will tell you what is the meaning of your
life. Otherwise, there is no meaning. We are

36
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,430
without any connections to the reality and
that's why we do not know where are we drifting,

37
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,039
what is happening to us, where are we going.
Now, I verily say to you that within us lies

38
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:44,229
this instrument. And this instrument is very
well intact in all of you.

39
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,039
Now, there are some people who have written
books after books which have really shocked

40
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,479
Me saying that is very dangerous to raise
the Kundalini, some people have said that

41
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,849
Kundalini is in the stomach - shows they are
unauthorized people or perhaps they do not

42
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:10,110
want you to have your self-knowledge, they
want to deviate you. Also you will find people

43
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,970
who will tell you that you should not do this
Kundalini awakening and all that because very

44
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:21,970
dangerous and this brings problem. Not at
all. This Kundalini which is in three and

45
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,770
a half coil is an energy of Pure desire within
you. All other desires rise within us and

46
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:46,190
once we achieve them we still are not satisfied
we are going from one desire to another. So

47
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:54,150
the law of economics is that in general desires
are not satiable.

48
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:02,129
So this is the only power which has to rise
and give us that Pure desire that once we

49
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,300
achieve it or once we manifest it then all
the desires become absolutely of no value.

50
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,460
Then this madness of desire goes away and
we understand all this transitory things,

51
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,460
all this pleasures of life with it's full
limitations and we know how far to go with

52
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,720
them.

53
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,720
But first we must seek the Eternal, we must
seek this All Pervading Power which is very

54
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:50,169
subtle and is all around us. But as human
beings are as you must have seen here also,

55
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,800
on top of your head here is on one side is
the yellow ego; on the left side is your superego

56
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:06,889
- is your conditionings. We have so many conditionings
in our mind. To say that I am an Indian and

57
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,240
you are British or you are this and you are
that is a conditioning. God never created

58
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,310
world like that, He created only one world.
We have made it like this. This is the one

59
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,810
world, this is another world, this is another
nation. We human beings have done - created

60
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,810
problem for us. Of course, I mean He did create
rivers and mountains and He did create different

61
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,400
type of people otherwise we all would have
looked like some military junta. But no He

62
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:50,410
made us differently to look different. That
was His idea to create beauty. Why we have

63
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,920
such conditionings, from the very childhood
we have conditionings of this kind, then we

64
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,630
think we are born in a particular religion.
So that is one another horrible conditioning

65
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,440
we have that we have got we are in this religion
so we must follow this religion. But in Sahaja

66
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,320
Yoga when you come you will be amazed to see
that those people who started all these religions

67
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,320
are the real people and once they started
it after some time is drifted into something

68
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:33,710
extremely nonsensical and now running away
from religion also you can not solve the problem

69
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,810
or running towards is just the same. So what
is it that you have to go beyond all these

70
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,400
conditionings that are there and also beyond
your ego.

71
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,250
Now, the ideas about ego are also prevalent
and people say that these are our karmas,

72
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,250
we must suffer. I know of so many people who
say that: "Mother what about karmas". Now,

73
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,920
the yellow stuff that you see there is the
ego, is the only human beings think that they

74
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,650
have done some bad karmas or good karmas.
Animals don't think. They are under the complete

75
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:21,650
control of God that's why they are called
as pashu means paash - completely controlled.

76
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,830
A dog is a dog, a scorpion is a scorpion and
tiger is a tiger. They behave the way they

77
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:34,830
are, but human beings are everything in them.
You may find somebody as a very nice dog and

78
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:42,930
suddenly becomes a snake. From where does
it come in? It comes because still all these

79
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:50,260
conditionings that are within us are built
in and then also this ego that has come into

80
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,830
us that I am doing this work, I am doing that
work. Now, see we have a beautiful hall of

81
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,490
course to be appreciated very much and we
should say that it's a very good piece of

82
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:08,490
art or whatever it is. But something like
a tree was dead, so we have made this platform

83
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,890
from dead to dead. We have done no living
work whatsoever, we cannot do it. But when

84
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,450
the Kundalini rises you will be surprised
in many people who have problems on their

85
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,730
centers you can see with naked eyes the pulsation
and on your hand you can see the pulsation

86
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:37,730
of the Kundalini rising and you can feel the
pulsation on top of your head here. And when

87
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,140
the pulsation disappears you feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head, out of your

88
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,140
own head. All these things are to be verified.
There cannot be pretensions about it, reality

89
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:59,710
stands by itself, it does not need any support.
So when all this happens to you, what you

90
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,350
get- the self-knowledge.

91
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,190
And what is the self-knowledge is to first
of all to know about your own centers. Now,

92
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,960
a person gets lunatic without knowing that
he is getting lunatic, a person gets cancer

93
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,230
without knowing he has got cancer. Whatever
happens to him, he does not know what is happening

94
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,060
to him. He has to go to doctors, spend lot
of money, everything and then the doctor certifies

95
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,060
no you have these ten diseases in you and
that now you will die after one month or so.

96
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,360
You don't know how it has developed in you,
how it has come suddenly to you but when these

97
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,260
centers are out of gear then you feel this
is wrong with you, that is wrong with you.

98
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,610
Because you are realized soul and you can
feel it on your fingertips when the centers

99
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,610
tell you that this is wrong with you. This
is not only on physical side, physical side

100
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,350
is the minimum that you get, but you find
out about emotional side, you find out about

101
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,600
your spiritual side also very clearly that
spiritually where are you. Just to certify

102
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,360
yourself that we are twice-born people or
we are this and this is misleading yourself.

103
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,350
You've not been kind to yourself, I should
say, and not honest to yourself.

104
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:39,350
We have to be honest, we have to find the
truth and we have to get to it, because it

105
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:47,530
is our own, this is our right to have it as
human beings and you cannot pay for it. One

106
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,320
thing if you understand you cannot pay for
it, you will understand what is reality. Like

107
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:03,810
the seed you plant in the Mother Earth. How
much do we pay to Mother Earth? How much did

108
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,250
we pay to Christ? How much did you pay to
Rama or Krishna? To any one of them how much

109
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,860
did we pay? But those who are now commercialized
all these ideas we are just getting lost into

110
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:32,650
it. So we have to, little bit, have a soul
searching and find out: "Where am I ?" I have

111
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,720
to find the truth and I must get to it.

112
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,840
This is the time when the whole world has
to emancipate, this is the resurrection time

113
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,920
or we can call it this is this Last Judgment.
But you will be judged by your own Kundalini

114
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,920
who is your Mother. She doesn't trouble you.
When you were born your mother took up all

115
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,820
the trouble, all the labor pains upon herself,
she didn't trouble you. In the same way this

116
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Kundalini doesn't trouble you and she is anxiously
waiting. I'm Myself amazed the way these days

117
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,760
the Kundalini is rising. Of course today we
have so many people I am sure you all will

118
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,540
get realization. But in a place like Paris
where I never had such hopes thousand people

119
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,640
getting realization I was amazed at that and
all of them full of joy, laughing, I have

120
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,640
never seen French women laughing that much.
They never laugh normally. I was amazed that

121
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,280
all there cheeks were up there, up to their
eyes and I said: "What's the matter?"

122
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,990
They said, "Mother, we don't know from where
this joy is pouring".

123
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,740
That's the quality of the Spirit that you
start feeling so joyous and the joy doesn't

124
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,740
have the duality of happiness and unhappiness.
It's singular. You just feel it from within

125
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,600
yourself, you enjoy yourself. Then another
quality of the Spirit is that when it comes

126
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,930
into your attention- the light of the Spirit
comes into your attention. Let's supposing

127
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,620
this room is completely dark, we don't know
how we relate to each other, where we are

128
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,640
sitting, if we start walking we might tumble
over other people, we may try to trample some

129
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,640
people. But if there is light you see, you
know where you are sitting, where others are

130
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:53,220
sitting, what is your chair, what is their
chair. So in that light of Spirit you develop

131
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:00,010
a new awareness, a new dimension which we
call as collective consciousness, which is

132
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:07,010
described by Jung very clearly. Jung has talked
about this and that is what happens to you,

133
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:14,600
it is not a false thing that, 'Oh! I am collectively
conscious'. No, it happens to you. Means you

134
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,600
can feel the chakras of another person, you
can feel what's wrong with him and you know

135
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,819
how to correct it. Under your hand itself
the Kundalini will rise, you get the powers,

136
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,660
you get your own powers to raise the Kundalini,
give realization. I mean, now I cannot go

137
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,280
all over the places, Sahaja Yogis are doing
this work. You all get those powers of raising

138
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,280
the Kundalini and giving realizations to others,
so that they find their own self, their own

139
00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,630
Spirit. So, the absolute knowledge can be
only known through self-realization, because

140
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,290
whatever you want to ask like a computer,
the answer comes in.

141
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,680
There is somebody who met Me in Paris. He
said: "I don't believe in God".

142
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,600
I said: All right, you ask a question to Me:
'Mother is there God?'. Stretch the hands

143
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,690
towards Me, ask the question three times.

144
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,120
"Mother, what's happening? This cool breeze
coming"

145
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:28,120
I said: "The answer has come, there is God".

146
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:35,230
So absolute knowledge is only possible when
you know the Absolute Truth and to have the

147
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,700
Absolute Truth you have to go to the Absolute
Being within you which is your Spirit. So,

148
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,700
it gives you the Truth, it gives you the collective
consciousness. The main thing is that you

149
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:59,050
become extremely peaceful personality, you
become peace, you emit peace. It's like the

150
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:07,750
wheel, the wheel at the periphery moving very
fast but in the center of the wheel is the

151
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:14,750
axis, it has to be silent otherwise cart won't
move and you jump onto that point within yourself

152
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,360
where you are completely peaceful with yourself,
completely integrated without any tension,

153
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:33,820
without any problems. And these other ideas
of removing tensions, this thing, that thing

154
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:42,040
are all artificial and mental. It cannot be
mental, it is beyond mental. When the Kundalini

155
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,970
rises as you see there this is the center
in the optic chiasma - Agnya chakra. When

156
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,970
it crosses that center then these two institutions
are sucked in and she passes through the limbic

157
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,450
area and comes out of your fontanella bone
area, which is the actualization 
of your realization. So, now for it is absolutely

158
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,560
evident for people to see that we have to
get to that stage and you have all the properties,

159
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,980
all the possibilities, everything within yourself
to get to it.

160
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,980
So, now you'll have to close your eyes. Before
closing the eyes, you can take out your spectacles

161
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:48,350
but please don't open your eyes till I tell
you. Nobody will have any problems. May be,

162
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:55,350
some of you might feel the cool breeze coming
out. Some will feel in their hands; some will

163
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,380
feel out of their heads. Some will feel little
heat coming out. Doesn't matter, let the heat

164
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,720
get out. Doesn't matter! It's very simple.
So, what I have to ask you is that you are

165
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,030
entering into the kingdom of God and you have
to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

166
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:42,030
First of, forgive yourself. Don't say it is
difficult. It's the easiest thing to say.

167
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Just forgive yourself. And, don't feel guilty.
Actually, forget the past because it's finished.

168
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,940
And, the future doesn't exist. You have to
be in the present. So, just forget about it.

169
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,750
Some people might be feeling guilty: 'Why
I read this book?' 'Why I read that book?'

170
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,910
Forget it! Done is done! Finished! So, have
confidence. All right!

171
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:23,910
Now, please put your left hand towards Me,
like this. And, now the right hand on your

172
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:33,770
heart and please close your eyes. Here now,
you have to ask Me like you ask a computer

173
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,060
- a question. You may call Me Shri Mataji
or you can call Me Mother - whatever suits

174
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,570
you.

175
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,570
Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this question
three times. In your heart.

176
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,950
Now, you should know that if you are the Spirit,
you are your master. So, please take your

177
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,720
hand on to the left side of your body in the
upper portion of your abdomen and press it

178
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:20,130
hard. Here, ask another fundamental question
three times.

179
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:57,050
Mother, am I my own master? Ask a question.
Please ask three times.

180
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I've already told you that I cannot force
pure knowledge on you. I cannot force! So,

181
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,860
now take your hand down in the lower portion
of your abdomen and ask six times a question.

182
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Or, you have to request. Six times because
this center has got six petals.

183
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Six
times as this center has got six petals.

184
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:58,700
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the
Kundalini has started moving upward. You may

185
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,010
not feel it but it is moving. So, now we have
to nourish the upper centers with our self

186
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:13,010
confidence to open them out. So, now raise
your right hand on to the upper portion of

187
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,900
your abdomen on the left hand side. Press
it hard and here, you have say with full confidence.

188
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,710
Mother, I am my own master. Just say it with
full confidence. Ten times because this center

189
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,309
has got ten petals.

190
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:36,929
Now, raise your right hand on to the heart
where resides the Spirit. I've already told

191
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:43,929
you that you are not this body; you are not
this mind; you are not this conditionings

192
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:00,080
nor your ego but you are the Spirit. Pure
Spirit! So, now raise your right hand on your

193
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:16,970
heart and say with full confidence twelve
times.

194
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:37,230
Mother, I am the Spirit. Twelve times! Mother,
I am the Spirit. Which you are!

195
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:03,270
I've already told you about this Divine Power
and this Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge;

196
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,020
is the ocean of compassion; is the ocean of
blessings. But above all, it is the ocean

197
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,960
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might
commit, the power of 

198
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:52,340
this ocean of forgiveness can dissolve all
that. So, now raise your right hand in to

199
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:52,460
the corner of your neck and your shoulder,
as far back as possible. Press it hard and

200
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,950
push your head to 

201
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,910
the right fully. Now here, you have to say
with full confidence in yourself.

202
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,870
Mother, I am not guilty at all.

203
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:30,870
I've already told you that whether you forgive
or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

204
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:43,220
But if you don't forgive then you play into
the hands of wrong people and you torture

205
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:53,220
yourself. So, you have to forgive everyone,
in general. So, raise your right hand on to

206
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,240
your forehead and put your small finger and
your thumb on two temples and three fingers

207
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:43,609
on your head and put down your head. This
is the control of the sympathetic and the

208
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,929
parasympathetic. Now, put down your head.
Put down fully! Now here, please say - very

209
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:56,649
important - if you don't forgive, I can't
forgive for you. You won't get your realization

210
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:03,649
because this center is a center which is a
very, very tight one. So, you have to forgive

211
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:13,450
everyone in general. Just say that! Just say
that!

212
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Mother, I forgive everyone. In your heart,
say it in your heart. Not how many times;

213
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,800
from your heart. Say it from your heart. Not
how many times; that's not important.

214
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:23,590
Now, please take back your hand on 

215
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,750
the back 

216
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:20,869
side 

217
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:36,980
of 

218
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:55,710
your head. Push back your head fully as far
as possible. Hold it. Now here, you have to

219
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:08,310
say for your own satisfaction without feeling
guilty; without counting your mistakes.

220
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:17,990
You have to just say: Oh Divine Power of Love,
if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,

221
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:31,770
please forgive me. Oh Divine Power, if I have
done any mistakes knowingly or committed any

222
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,520
wrongs knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive
me.

223
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,520
You say it from your heart. Not how many times
but from your heart.

224
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Now, please stretch your hand or stretch your
palm fully and put the center of your palm

225
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,160
on top of the fontanel area which was the
soft bone in your childhood. Now, please bend

226
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:37,460
your head as much as you can. Push back your
fingers as much as you can. Please push back

227
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:35,170
your fingers. Put a good pressure on the fontanel
bone area. And now, again I have to tell you

228
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:06,320
that 

229
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:41,150
I respect your freedom. I cannot force Self-Realization
on you. So, you have ask for it in 
your freedom. So, now move your scalp seven

230
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:37,830
times slowly; seven times slowly clockwise
saying: 'Mother, please give me my Self-Realization'.

231
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:53,670
Now, please take down your hands. Slowly open
your eyes. You 

232
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:07,970
can wear your spectacles. Put your hands up
like that. Watch Me. Can 
you 

233
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:24,780
do 

234
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:06,450
it without thinking? Watch Me.
