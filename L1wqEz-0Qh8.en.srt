1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,859
Guru Puja.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:06,930
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

3
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:33,370
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

4
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:48,800
What does a guru do.

5
00:03:48,800 --> 00:04:03,750
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

6
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:12,670
Actually it is all there - everything.

7
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:28,640
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

8
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:43,220
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

9
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:51,240
It's all contained within you.

10
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:10,280
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

11
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,560
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

12
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,660
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

13
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,630
There is nothing that you get from outside.

14
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:42,850
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

15
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:53,800
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

16
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:08,270
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

17
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,520
That is the first step.

18
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:25,780
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

19
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,070
world, this is all an illusion.

20
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:39,270
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

21
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,110
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

22
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,310
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

23
00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:02,640
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

24
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:12,390
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

25
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,770
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

26
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,210
to know yourself.

27
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,010
But people get into rituals.

28
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,770
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

29
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:46,540
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

30
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,290
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

31
00:07:51,290 --> 00:08:00,770
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

32
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,390
Because it is all ignorance.

33
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:14,750
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

34
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:26,470
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

35
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,780
They pamper your ego.

36
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:41,720
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

37
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:50,420
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

38
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,010
connection with God, which you are not.

39
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,950
To know God you should know your Self first.

40
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,880
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

41
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,760
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

42
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,300
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

43
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,420
The experience is not sufficient.

44
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,110
The knowledge has to come.

45
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,220
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

46
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,230
Now you have to tally it.

47
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,270
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

48
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,890
Is it true or not?

49
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,510
Is it correct or not?

50
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,670
Or is it just another illusion?

51
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:59,380
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

52
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,670
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

53
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:11,930
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

54
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,940
is something special about you.

55
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:28,830
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

56
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:37,820
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

57
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:51,210
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

58
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:59,850
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

59
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:14,680
Then what starts is introspection.

60
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:23,710
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

61
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,120
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

62
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:42,320
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

63
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:51,890
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

64
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,230
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

65
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,700
great and they don't need any introspection.

66
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:13,330
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

67
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,050
it Self realisation.

68
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,420
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you, how

69
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,040
far you have come.

70
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,590
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

71
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,770
You can do it later on.

72
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,440
You must hear with full concentration.

73
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:52,630
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

74
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,630
gradually.

75
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,630
How?

76
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:07,700
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

77
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,840
very gentle and mild.

78
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:26,430
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

79
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,170
At that stage you have no fears.

80
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:42,380
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

81
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,400
You are not easily disturbed there.

82
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:56,010
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

83
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,130
is something wrong within yourself.

84
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,950
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

85
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:15,890
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

86
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:27,740
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

87
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:42,450
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:49,810
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

89
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:56,340
to verify how far it is correct.

90
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:10,820
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

91
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:26,870
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

92
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:35,870
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

93
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:47,670
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

94
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:58,810
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

95
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:13,020
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

96
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,570
How you love.

97
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,800
What is the quality of your compassion?

98
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:38,190
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

99
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:46,760
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

100
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,560
You will do anything for that person.

101
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,090
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

102
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,800
This is just the love.

103
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,670
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

104
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:25,590
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

105
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:38,150
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

106
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:48,140
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

107
00:17:48,140 --> 00:18:01,940
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

108
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,900
that person you try to tolerate.

109
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:15,180
Such a person just tolerates.

110
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:31,950
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

111
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,900
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

112
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:44,090
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

113
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,900
They don't have any anger about anyone.

114
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,580
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

115
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:06,240
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

116
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,710
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

117
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:20,260
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

118
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,080
People never liked them.

119
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:36,870
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

120
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,640
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

121
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:55,260
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive

122
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
them.

123
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,490
What they are doing they don't know'.

124
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,830
Extremely compassionate.

125
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,990
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

126
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:19,440
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

127
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,090
They are not disturbed.

128
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:33,630
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

129
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,300
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

130
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:49,240
They just enjoy their devotion.

131
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,840
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

132
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Devotion to God.

133
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:10,700
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

134
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,450
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

135
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:31,660
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

136
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:46,090
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

137
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,640
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

138
00:21:51,640 --> 00:22:01,630
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

139
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,350
but they are in the present.

140
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:13,550
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

141
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:26,280
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them, they immediately go into thoughtless

142
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,650
awareness.

143
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,630
That is what their capacity is.

144
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:40,080
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

145
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,850
Now I'll tell you my own example.

146
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,740
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

147
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,430
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

148
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:06,970
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

149
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,160
and one child fell down.

150
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:16,140
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

151
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,590
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

152
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,020
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

153
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,750
I said, "I'll go in any case!

154
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,160
". So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

155
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,450
go to the airport".

156
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,260
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

157
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,020
Let's go!".

158
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:49,480
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

159
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,610
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York, and I wanted to go to Washington

160
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,440
only!

161
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:09,450
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

162
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:18,120
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

163
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,260
That means it's a effortless.

164
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:40,300
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

165
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:52,460
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

166
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:03,970
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

167
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,090
guarantee for your safety.

168
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,860
For everything that you want to do.

169
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,710
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

170
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,710
You can become also very powerful!

171
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:33,920
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

172
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:44,280
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

173
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,930
you have to have.

174
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:51,950
Everything is provided by the Divine.

175
00:25:51,950 --> 00:26:05,220
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

176
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:18,410
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

177
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,400
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

178
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:32,390
You just close your eyes and things work out.

179
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:41,230
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

180
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,530
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

181
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:55,670
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

182
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:09,520
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

183
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,660
for which the Divine is responsible.

184
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,530
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

185
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:27,000
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

186
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,520
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

187
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:43,940
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come, he'll

188
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,300
never come.

189
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,650
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

190
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,560
use your compassion.

191
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,330
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

192
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:10,460
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

193
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,520
So now you have got your Self realisation.

194
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,060
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

195
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:26,860
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

196
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:33,610
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

197
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:43,160
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

198
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,740
And some men also are like that.

199
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:59,580
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

200
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:07,350
you should win over the partner of your life.

201
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,870
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

202
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,920
But women indulge into so many other things.

203
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:24,390
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

204
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:33,170
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

205
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,300
Without meditation you cannot rise.

206
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,440
You have to meditate.

207
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,410
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

208
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,410
No!

209
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,930
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

210
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,340
With the cleansing you understand.

211
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:05,900
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

212
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,380
That is done by Divine.

213
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:16,140
But you must religiously meditate.

214
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:25,690
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

215
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:36,910
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

216
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:43,430
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

217
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:51,080
All sorts of problems can be solved.

218
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,750
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

219
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:04,590
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

220
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,700
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

221
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:20,160
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

222
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,410
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

223
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:36,200
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

224
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,100
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

225
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,230
It just envelops you completely.

226
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:53,910
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

227
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,510
It works so many miracles.

228
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:05,460
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

229
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,190
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

230
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,090
to develop shraddha.

231
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:24,760
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

232
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:36,680
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

233
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:44,230
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

234
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:51,210
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

235
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:57,200
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

236
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:05,430
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

237
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,350
do it for popularity.

238
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,120
Many people are like that.

239
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,790
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

240
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:23,080
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

241
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:30,880
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

242
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:40,050
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

243
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:51,040
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

244
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,010
solutions to things.

245
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,980
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

246
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:08,550
It can find solutions to all your problems.

247
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:19,010
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

248
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,290
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

249
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:30,100
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

250
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:37,880
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

251
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:47,170
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

252
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:59,600
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

253
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,290
within, which makes you understand.

254
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:11,470
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

255
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,820
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

256
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:25,890
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

257
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,660
it to the leader.

258
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,630
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

259
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:39,600
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

260
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:51,560
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

261
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,820
They never see their own faults.

262
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,780
What's the use of finding faults of others?

263
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,690
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

264
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:11,740
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help, which you can work

265
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,690
it out.

266
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:24,080
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

267
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,910
defects and get them corrected.

268
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:37,200
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this, "I like this, I like

269
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
that".

270
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,690
But what about the Spirit?

271
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,890
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

272
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,680
Does it like?

273
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,690
Does it enjoy?

274
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,850
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

275
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:02,380
It's very common in the West.

276
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,610
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

277
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:14,680
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

278
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:26,560
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine what I feel

279
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,830
about them.

280
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:34,290
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

281
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:45,150
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

282
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:55,320
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

283
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,950
grace on your being.

284
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,310
The love of other people enthrals you.

285
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:15,160
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

286
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,400
friendship in that kind of relationship.

287
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,370
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

288
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:34,390
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

289
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:41,120
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

290
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,370
person -- instead of helping that person.

291
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,540
Always people are in trouble.

292
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,010
Then collectively you must help that person.

293
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,230
Not talk ill of that person.

294
00:38:53,230 --> 00:39:02,460
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

295
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,580
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

296
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:20,140
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

297
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,760
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

298
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,800
You had the experience.

299
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,020
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

300
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:42,490
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge is really there or

301
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,620
not.

302
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:58,280
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

303
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,660
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

304
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,160
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration what's wrong

305
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
with me".

306
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:17,920
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

307
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:28,860
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

308
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,380
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

309
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,850
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

310
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:44,650
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

311
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:58,470
And they have given us such a good attention,
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their

312
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,090
hospitals.

313
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:10,570
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself, what

314
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,560
are you?

315
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

316
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:45,500
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

317
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:54,710
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

318
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:04,830
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

319
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:13,910
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved, a great

320
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,910
personality.

321
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:21,510
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

322
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,070
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

323
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:35,510
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

324
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:42,060
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

325
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:54,730
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

326
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:03,670
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

327
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,340
Are you one of these type?

328
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:12,990
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

329
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,300
It's a process, I must confess.

330
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:22,530
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

331
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:31,250
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

332
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,260
had a very strong desire.

333
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,790
What are we seeking?

334
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:44,340
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

335
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:50,800
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

336
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,300
So we seek.

337
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,670
We seek.

338
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:59,330
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

339
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:08,230
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

340
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:14,820
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

341
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,850
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

342
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:27,540
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

343
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:34,290
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

344
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:40,860
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

345
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,810
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

346
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,040
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

347
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,090
She said, "I gave it up".

348
00:44:53,090 --> 00:45:01,540
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

349
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,530
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

350
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:16,050
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

351
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,480
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

352
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,260
Guru's job is to guide people.

353
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,850
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

354
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,990
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

355
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,810
That I have to tell you.

356
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:41,770
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

357
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:51,080
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

358
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:58,680
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

359
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:07,140
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved, what is your

360
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,610
understanding?

361
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,060
What do you know?

362
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,030
Why these disasters are coming?

363
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,590
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

364
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,240
It has to become very collective.

365
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,530
It has to spread much more, all over.

366
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,020
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

367
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,280
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

368
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,970
But go all out!

369
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,340
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

370
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,130
Of course the people went into wrong things.

371
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:52,820
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

372
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:01,700
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

373
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:10,050
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

374
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:17,560
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

375
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,320
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

376
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:32,680
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

377
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,410
for the collective?

378
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,170
Are we talking about it?

379
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,510
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

380
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:42,340
Are we making people know about it?'

381
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:53,290
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad

382
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,350
vibrations.

383
00:47:55,350 --> 00:48:07,980
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

384
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,090
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

385
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,150
"My God" I said.

386
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:19,640
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

387
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,840
So, what will happen?

388
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Disasters!

389
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:31,880
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

390
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:41,370
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

391
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,960
to them, and how they spread their message.

392
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:52,840
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

393
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,310
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

394
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:04,960
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

395
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,220
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

396
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,340
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

397
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:24,930
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

398
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:29,700
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

399
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,580
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

400
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,570
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

401
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:41,730
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

402
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:47,510
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

403
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,100
nonsense, you get it.

404
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,210
You are saved from so many things.

405
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:02,550
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

406
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:09,930
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

407
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,910
But why not save the whole world?

408
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:20,740
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

409
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:27,180
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

410
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,620
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

411
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,080
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

412
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:44,930
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

413
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,750
Go everywhere.

414
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,370
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:58,050
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

416
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:07,150
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

417
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,730
to save this Mother Earth.

418
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,300
You have to save the people who are in it.

419
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:19,240
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

420
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,630
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

421
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:28,420
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

422
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,040
Not that the people are stupid.

423
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:41,360
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

424
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:48,250
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

425
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:55,530
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

426
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:02,830
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

427
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,680
we don't want!".

428
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:15,170
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

429
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,650
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

430
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,630
God is wrathful, no doubt.

431
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,840
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

432
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,230
We have to save this Mother Earth.

433
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:38,560
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

434
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,040
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

435
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,220
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

436
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,760
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

437
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,730
You can talk about it to people.

438
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:02,120
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

439
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:08,660
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

440
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:15,230
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same and talk about

441
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,230
it.

442
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:25,130
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

443
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:34,370
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

444
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:39,520
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

445
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,540
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

446
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,390
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

447
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,680
Because you are always saved.

448
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,310
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

449
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:03,320
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

450
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:16,460
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

451
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:29,160
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

452
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,910
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

453
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,560
to fight it.

454
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:42,080
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

455
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,080
a difference.

456
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,720
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

457
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:57,430
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

458
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:09,580
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

459
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,580
above jealousies, above talking loose.

460
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:20,620
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

461
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,370
gurus if you try to do that.

462
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,630
This is what you have to achieve.

463
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:33,090
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

464
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,670
May God Bless You All
