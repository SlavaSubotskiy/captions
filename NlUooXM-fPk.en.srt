1
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,402
You can sit here also, some of you, it’s good...

2
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,402
I think you can come here, there is room.

3
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:11,484
Some of you can move here so that they can also come here,

4
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,818
so it won’t be a problem.

5
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:21,860
You sit in front here.

6
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,985
You are better, you see.

7
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:33,484
Good.

8
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,277
Open this door, would be all right.

9
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:11,026
It’s all right, you can open the door if you like.

10
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:13,152
It’s all right.

11
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:18,277
Better open – these doors cannot be opened?

12
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,277
They don’t open?

13
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:28,277
Oh, my God! You need a tall person.

14
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,943
You need Hanumana!

15
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:35,818
Take His name and He’ll open!

16
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:51,609
Keep a chair in front of that.

17
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,402
Today we have come here

18
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,617
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

19
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:34,734
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

20
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:41,734
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

21
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:49,693
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

22
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,526
in our futuristic planning,

23
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:58,818
or in our mental activities;

24
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,568
He gives us guidance and protection.

25
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,068
As you know that Germany is a place where

26
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:20,193
people are very active, very right-sided,

27
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:25,068
use their brain too much,

28
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:29,442
and they are very machine-oriented also.

29
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:35,318
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

30
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,026
who is an eternal child

31
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:43,443
– because He was like a monkey,

32
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,402
His head was that of a monkey,

33
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:49,568
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

34
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:54,734
and He was the one who was used

35
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:58,402
to run the right side of human beings.

36
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:04,818
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

37
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,609
To begin with He has to control the sun,

38
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:10,651
that the sun in the people,

39
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,235
if there is too much sun

40
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,985
then He must try to control it

41
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:19,734
and make it cooler, or smoother.

42
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:26,360
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

43
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:30,235
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

44
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,943
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

45
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:38,318
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

46
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,818
There He had to be told,

47
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,442
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

48
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,985
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

49
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:49,734
– because He thought that this sun

50
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:53,568
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

51
00:07:54,068 --> 00:08:00,402
So the beauty of His character is that

52
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:06,484
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

53
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:11,568
has to control the right side,

54
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:16,568
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

55
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,152
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

56
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,943
They’re over-right-sided,

57
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,568
then even they get children,

58
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,026
but they are really not liked by the children

59
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,277
because they have no time for children,

60
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,776
they all the time are very strict with the children,

61
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:35,152
they shout them, shout at them,

62
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,402
they don’t know how to handle the children.

63
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,443
Or they’re over-indulgent,

64
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:44,235
because they always think that “I never got this,

65
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,568
so let me give it to the child.”

66
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,277
So these extreme type of people

67
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:54,026
who are right-sided

68
00:08:55,693 --> 00:09:00,360
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

69
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:08,152
He is very anxious, very anxious

70
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,443
to do the work of Shri Rama.

71
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:14,152
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

72
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:18,693
which is full of balance, absolutely.

73
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:22,443
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

74
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:27,193
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

75
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:33,693
to do the work,

76
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:40,318
or to supply Him or to help Him

77
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:43,568
– like a secretary you can call Him;

78
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,442
and Shri Hanumana was the one

79
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,152
who was created for this purpose.

80
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:53,360
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

81
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:58,152
was such a assistant;

82
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:01,193
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

83
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,943
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

84
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,152
– even the servants, you see,

85
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,484
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

86
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,901
We can say like a dog or a horse,

87
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:22,068
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

88
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:30,360
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

89
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,402
navadha siddhis.

90
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,609
Nine siddhis He got.

91
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:41,484
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

92
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,693
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

93
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,068
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

94
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,068
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

95
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,568
There are nine siddhis that He got.

96
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:05,068
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

97
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,776
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

98
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:18,360
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

99
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:19,943
in his life?

100
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,402
What He does is to control his movement,

101
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:26,443
He makes him in such a way

102
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:31,402
that he has to put down his speed.

103
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,443
He makes his feet very heavy;

104
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,443
now he can’t do that much.

105
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:41,026
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

106
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:45,026
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

107
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:56,068
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

108
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,152
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

109
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:09,484
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

110
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:17,277
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

111
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,776
He has only one gadaa in His hand

112
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:27,484
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

113
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:32,026
and He can handle people with His tails,

114
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:33,901
He does not have to use His hand.

115
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:37,901
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

116
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:43,068
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

117
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,402
and sit on that.

118
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,110
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

119
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,943
as you’re to call them, you see,

120
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,943
and all these things He has within Himself

121
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,193
is to control a person

122
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,110
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

123
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,985
Then He can fly in the air.

124
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:09,860
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

125
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,193
but He can just fly in the air.

126
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,360
That means He can become so big

127
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,318
that the amount of air He displaces

128
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:24,985
has a much more weight than His own weight

129
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,068
– just the same principle Archimedes,

130
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,110
if you know the Archimedes principle

131
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,943
– that He becomes so big that His body

132
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:38,442
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

133
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,402
And He can fly in the air,

134
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:49,860
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

135
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,860
from one to another, through the ether.

136
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:57,943
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

137
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,776
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

138
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,235
He is the one who controls,

139
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:11,193
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

140
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,734
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

141
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,110
it communicates.

142
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,734
All the communications that you find,

143
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:23,442
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

144
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,068
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

145
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:30,860
is through Hanumana’s movement;

146
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,318
because He can go into a nirakar,

147
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,651
He can go into a formless state.

148
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,193
Also the communications,

149
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,402
we use it for this communication that we have,

150
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:46,068
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

151
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:49,985
but we have a television, we have got radios

152
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:51,734
and all those things.

153
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,193
Where we catch on to the ether,

154
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:59,776
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

155
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:03,651
and are available to people who are right-sided.

156
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:09,818
Only the right-sided people discover these things

157
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:14,484
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

158
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:19,068
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

159
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:24,152
where we don’t use any wires.

160
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:27,734
So without any connection through the ether,

161
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,110
He can manage.

162
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:35,734
So all the ethereal connections has been done

163
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,860
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

164
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,609
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

165
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,068
that you cannot challenge it,

166
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,860
and you cannot find faults with it.

167
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,484
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

168
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:53,193
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

169
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:54,985
He’s perfectly there.

170
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,193
Now the scientists discover it and think that

171
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:03,985
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

172
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,318
We say something in the ether

173
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:09,484
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

174
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,443
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

175
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:16,526
we say something here or we relay something

176
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,318
on the television and it is seen the other side.

177
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:25,734
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

178
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,026
what is the way.

179
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,318
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

180
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:39,526
who has done such a beautiful network,

181
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:43,860
and through that network all these things work out.

182
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:47,734
So even on the right side

183
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:54,901
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

184
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:59,609
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

185
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,068
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

186
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:06,651
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

187
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,360
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

188
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:10,985
you all must be knowing about it.

189
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,360
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

190
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,443
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

191
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,985
nobody wants to find out,

192
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:20,901
because after all in an atom or...

193
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,734
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

194
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:30,110
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

195
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,443
So He has another great,

196
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:40,193
great siddhi which we call as anima.

197
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,860
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

198
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,068
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

199
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:51,277
or “renu” is the atom.

200
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:54,277
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

201
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:55,985
Now, many scientists think that they have,

202
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:58,693
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

203
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,193
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

204
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:07,860
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

205
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,818
so is already described there.

206
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:16,318
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

207
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:20,693
the electromagnetic forces working,

208
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,818
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

209
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:29,943
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

210
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,068
So now we can see that as Ganesha

211
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:37,734
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

212
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,442
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

213
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,693
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

214
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:49,526
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

215
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,818
on the material side of it.

216
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:59,068
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

217
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:05,442
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

218
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:12,526
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

219
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,152
of the different sides of our brain.

220
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,277
So how much He gives us.

221
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:25,609
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

222
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,193
then He gives us the power to think.

223
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:33,985
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

224
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:36,277
That is, we can say that,

225
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:41,484
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

226
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:47,818
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

227
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,943
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

228
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,943
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

229
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,985
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

230
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,818
But conscience is needed in a personality

231
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:05,277
where he is to be controlled,

232
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:09,860
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

233
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:12,484
which is the conscience in the human being.

234
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,734
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

235
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:21,860
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

236
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:24,734
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

237
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:28,277
means, “sat” means truth,

238
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:30,734
“asat” means untruth,

239
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:34,193
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

240
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,277
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

241
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:44,609
So, intelligence to discriminate between

242
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:51,277
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

243
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,235
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

244
00:20:56,651 --> 00:21:01,651
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

245
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:03,193
He’s the adhyaksha,

246
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,318
means He is the – I call Him

247
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:07,776
as the chancellor of the university.

248
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,443
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

249
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:15,235
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

250
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:22,443
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

251
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,609
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

252
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,318
nirvichara samadhi

253
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:30,526
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

254
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,526
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

255
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:36,776
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

256
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:50,776
But the understanding that this is good,

257
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,110
this is for our benevolence,

258
00:21:55,985 --> 00:22:02,442
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

259
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:06,651
And it’s very important for Western people

260
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,526
because it has to be mental,

261
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,860
otherwise they won’t understand.

262
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:14,443
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

263
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:15,985
It has to be mental.

264
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,318
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

265
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,360
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

266
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:29,318
Without Him, even if you become a saint

267
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:32,443
you will be – of course, you are a saint

268
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,360
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

269
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,985
but whether this saintliness is

270
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,526
all right if you live on Himalayas,

271
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:46,609
or is all right when you go across to people

272
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:49,734
to give them realization – all this scanning,

273
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:52,360
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

274
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:56,526
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

275
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,360
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

276
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:05,484
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

277
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,318
I should say, an essence of right side;

278
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,651
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

279
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,734
is important to get the protector of right side

280
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,443
here worshipped.

281
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:24,110
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

282
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,443
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

283
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,443
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

284
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:34,442
Now what is Shri Rama?

285
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:36,734
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

286
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,110
He works for the benevolence.

287
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:44,110
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

288
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:45,651
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

289
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:47,985
the English words are not so good to explain this,

290
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:52,318
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

291
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,734
who will not push forward Himself.

292
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,860
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

293
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:01,651
He is a very poised person.

294
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,526
So the Hanumana, you see,

295
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,235
He, He is the one who is always anxious

296
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:11,609
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

297
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,651
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

298
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:18,901
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

299
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:23,026
is the kind of a herb that was needed

300
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,110
to bring Lakshmana to life

301
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:29,985
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

302
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,901
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

303
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:36,776
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

304
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:42,360
And the discrimination in this is that,

305
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,776
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

306
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,776
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

307
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:50,360
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

308
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,526
like a guru and [*]shishya.

309
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:55,443
But even more than that, that the shishya

310
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:59,693
is just like a subservient servant,

311
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,026
absolutely surrendered to God,

312
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:07,526
absolutely surrendered to God,

313
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,985
and His main thing is surrender.

314
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:13,985
Now see, this surrender itself

315
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:17,651
shows that all those who are right-sided people

316
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,901
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

317
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,026
Mostly all those right-sided people

318
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,776
are very surrendered to their bosses,

319
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,985
surrendered to their jobs,

320
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,693
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

321
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:35,901
But they are subservient to wrong people,

322
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:38,277
they have no discretion.

323
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,110
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

324
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,152
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

325
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,901
then He tells you that you have to be

326
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:50,526
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

327
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,026
or to your Guru like Rama.

328
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,443
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

329
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,526
And then you are a free bird,

330
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:02,152
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

331
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:10,443
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

332
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:15,568
to antidote your too-much thinking,

333
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:18,318
to antidote your ego.

334
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:22,901
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

335
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,443
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

336
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:34,776
– is the capital of Ravana

337
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:37,526
– and the way He made fun of him.

338
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,360
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

339
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:44,693
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

340
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:50,110
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

341
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:53,526
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

342
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,152
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

343
00:26:57,443 --> 00:27:00,860
and tickled his nose with His tail.

344
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:08,693
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

345
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:11,360
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

346
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:14,651
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

347
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,442
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

348
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,442
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

349
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,693
and has broken his crown.

350
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,901
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

351
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,860
to protect you from egoistical people.

352
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,651
And also He protects the egoistical people

353
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:35,442
by showing them down – like, say, Saddam.

354
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:39,484
In the case of Saddam I just asked Hanumana to do the job,

355
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,193
because I know He’ll do it.

356
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:44,818
Now, how He has put this Saddam

357
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:47,152
into different circumstances,

358
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:49,734
that he doesn’t know what to do,

359
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:52,360
he doesn’t know how to go.

360
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:55,568
Because supposing he says, “All right, I’ll have war”;

361
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:58,818
so the whole of Iraq will be finished,

362
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,277
he’ll be finished,

363
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:03,360
Kuwait will be finished, all petrol will be finished, all right.

364
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:04,943
Everybody will be in trouble.

365
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:08,026
But what about him? – he won’t be there, too.

366
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,193
Because if the Americans have to fight,

367
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,443
they will go in his place and fight.

368
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,068
They won’t fight in America,

369
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,277
he’s not going to go to America to fight them.

370
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:17,734
Few Americans may be dead.

371
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:21,943
So now, in this Saddam’s brain

372
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:24,068
also Hanumana is working and telling him,

373
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:29,693
“Now see, Mister, if you do like this, then this will happen.”

374
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:35,152
He works into the brains of all the politicians,

375
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,360
all these egoistical people.

376
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:41,776
And then, then they get sometimes stunned,

377
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:43,693
sometimes they change their policies,

378
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:47,943
they come round and that’s how they manage.

379
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:53,943
Also another great quality of Hanumana is that He makes,

380
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:59,568
makes people – sort of an arbitrator He is

381
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:02,484
– He makes people meet each other.

382
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:05,068
And two egoistical people,

383
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,568
He will make them meet,

384
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,818
and then He’ll create such situation

385
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,776
that they both become friends and become mild.

386
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:19,235
So His whole character within us acts us to see our ego,

387
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:23,360
discriminate that “Oh, this is my ego that is working,”

388
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:29,068
and then to become childlike and sweet,

389
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,901
mirthful and happy.

390
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,776
He’s always in a dancing mood,

391
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,568
all the time He’s dancing,

392
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:38,277
and before Rama He’s always bowed down,

393
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:43,943
and always wants to do whatever is the desire of Shri Ram.

394
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:47,235
So if Ganesha stands behind Me,

395
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,609
Hanumana stands here at My feet,

396
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:51,068
and He’s there.

397
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:55,693
In the same way I would say, if Germany – as Philip,

398
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:00,277
he has asked Me that if

399
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:03,609
Germany can become like Hanumana

400
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,152
– then what a dynamic force we have,

401
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:08,818
if they become so subservient.

402
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:14,068
And the subservient nature of Hanumana

403
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:16,360
is seen to such an extent that,

404
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:18,402
as you know the story of Sita

405
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,277
when She gave a necklace to Him

406
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:25,402
and He wouldn’t wear it, because inside there was no Ram.

407
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,860
Once, Sita felt that all the time He is around,

408
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,901
and so He’s sort of cutting out Her privacy.

409
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:40,235
So She said, “Now, You can be there only for one work.

410
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:41,901
You need not to do every work.”

411
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,443
He used to do every work of Shri Rama.

412
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:45,568
She said, “For one work You should be there.

413
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,026
Choose whichever work You want to do.”

414
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:52,442
He said, “Only, you see, I would like to be with Shri Ram,

415
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,860
that whenever He sneezes I should do like this.”

416
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:57,318
You see, in India when we sneeze,

417
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:58,651
we have to do like this with this;

418
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,152
because the sneezing is, you see, avoids,

419
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,443
to avoid all the negativity to go out.

420
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,318
So we do like this if you sneeze.

421
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:13,651
Or if you feel sleepy

422
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:19,235
and you yawn, then also we do like that, mostly.

423
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:24,068
So He said, “Whenever He’ll yawn, You allow Me just to...”

424
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:25,526
– this we call as chutki,

425
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,110
I don’t know what you call this, chutki –

426
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:30,110
“allow Me to do this.”

427
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,734
Sita said, “This is something very little work,

428
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:34,943
you see, this fellow then will be out of sight.”

429
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,484
So He stood there.

430
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,860
So She said, “Now, why are You standing here?”

431
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,235
“I am waiting for that.

432
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,985
So how can I go?”

433
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:51,484
And that’s how – She granted, first She granted,

434
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:52,943
“All right, given to You this job,”

435
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,943
now She can’t take it back because She’s granted this job.

436
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,818
So He’s always there like this standing,

437
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,402
just to do this to Shri Ram.

438
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:05,068
So I mean, the sweetness of the whole thing

439
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:10,651
is that every time, every minute He is subservient,

440
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:13,943
He’s attentive, He’s there.

441
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:19,068
Also in Sahaja Yoga

442
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:27,442
I have relationships with you as a Guru, as a Mother

443
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,818
and, I don’t know, unlimited.

444
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:38,110
But still these two relationships we know of,

445
00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:40,609
that I’m your Mother and I’m your Guru.

446
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:43,734
Now My – as a Guru,

447
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:47,193
My main concern is that

448
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:50,526
you should learn all about Sahaja Yog,

449
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,318
you should become experts of Sahaja Yoga,

450
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:57,068
and you should become yourself the gurus.

451
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:59,235
It’s the only concern I have.

452
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:02,068
But for that, complete surrender is required.

453
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,985
“Islam” means surrender.

454
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,609
So you have to surrender.

455
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,277
If you are surrendered,

456
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:10,526
then only you can learn what is the,

457
00:33:10,818 --> 00:33:17,526
what is the way you will handle Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:20,402
Now, even this surrendering

459
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:23,110
is done by Shri Hanumana.

460
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:26,568
He’s the one who teaches you how to surrender now

461
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,985
or makes you surrender,

462
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,235
because egoistical people don’t surrender.

463
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:36,318
Then He puts some sort of hurdles

464
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:40,318
or some sort of miracles or some tricks,

465
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:48,443
by which then a disciple surrenders himself to the Guru.

466
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,235
Otherwise he’s not surrendered,

467
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,442
he finds it difficult to surrender,

468
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:59,235
and the force that acts to make him surrender to the Guru

469
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,026
is also that of Hanumana.

470
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,901
So not that He is only surrendered,

471
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,860
but He makes others also to be surrendered.

472
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:11,985
Because only the – because of ego you cannot surrender,

473
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:15,235
so He’s the one who fights your ego,

474
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:20,360
and He puts it down and makes you surrender.

475
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:23,651
So in His own expression,

476
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:30,442
I would say that what He has shown that

477
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,901
there’s a very beautiful area of right side.

478
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:40,360
If it is to be perfectly enjoyed

479
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,651
then you should be completely surrendered to your Guru,

480
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:48,443
as if you are the servant of that Guru.

481
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,484
Whatever you have to do for that Guru,

482
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:54,651
you have to do it.

483
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,651
Of course, you must know that your Guru

484
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,193
has to give you realization, minimum,

485
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,402
otherwise that’s not a guru.

486
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:04,609
But anybody who has given you the realization,

487
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,943
you have to be so surrendered

488
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:09,442
that you should be just like a servant,

489
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,402
not to feel shy about it.

490
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,985
Like I would now sometimes,

491
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:15,068
you know, I am going by, say,

492
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:18,110
I’m going by aeroplane,

493
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,818
and sometimes I cannot wear My shoes

494
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:25,193
because they’re so swollen up.

495
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:28,068
So normally I would take the shoes in My hands

496
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:29,651
and walk about.

497
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:31,442
But I have seen Sahaja yogis,

498
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:33,609
they pick up My shoes also and walk with it,

499
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,985
and they don’t feel shy about it.

500
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,402
They just feel so proud that they are carrying My shoes.

501
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:41,318
So there is not

502
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:44,860
– one should feel proud that you are doing all these things,

503
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:48,609
that you have a chance to do all these things for your Guru,

504
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,193
and that you are surrendering to that Guru;

505
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,110
you are absolutely only bothered

506
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:57,402
as to how you can serve the Guru,

507
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:59,110
how you can please the Guru,

508
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:03,318
and how you could be closer to that Guru.

509
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:06,193
It doesn’t mean physical closeness

510
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:10,609
but a kind of a rapport, a kind of an understanding.

511
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,484
Even those who are away from Me can feel Me in their heart.

512
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:16,651
And this is what it is, that

513
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:23,442
we have to get this power from Shri Hanumana.

514
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:28,402
Now, He’s the one who protects also all the deities.

515
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,818
He protects. Now, there’s a difference

516
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,068
between Shri Ganesha and Him.

517
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:39,235
The Shri Ganesha gives energy shakti,

518
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:42,442
but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

519
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,402
So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna

520
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:48,860
was the chariot of Arjuna,

521
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,318
then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana,

522
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:55,068
not Shri Ganesh.

523
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:58,734
Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him.

524
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:04,526
Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu,

525
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:07,193
so He has to look after Him.

526
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:10,484
He is an angel, as you know:

527
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:14,985
according to Christian, we should say according to Bible,

528
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,526
that He is the angel called Gabriel.

529
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:24,484
Now Gabriel is the one who brought the message,

530
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:28,985
because He’s always a messenger, to Maria,

531
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:32,609
and it’s surprisingly the words He used were

532
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:37,651
“Immaculata Salve” – that’s My name.

533
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:39,318
My first name is Nirmala,

534
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:41,818
means “Immaculata” and surname is Salve.

535
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,943
He said those words to Her.

536
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:46,985
And today also I was surprised

537
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:50,943
when it came to giving Me a present,

538
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,985
they found a tea-set and dinner-set

539
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:57,193
which is called as “Maria.”

540
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:02,193
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumana all Her life.

541
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:05,068
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.

542
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:10,068
Mahalakshmi being the Sita, Sita then Radha,

543
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:13,484
Hanumana has to be there to serve Her.

544
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:17,235
And that is why, you see, sometimes

545
00:38:17,651 --> 00:38:20,860
people say, “Mother, how did You know?

546
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,193
Mother, how did You come to know?

547
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:27,110
Mother, how did You send a message?

548
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:30,110
Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?

549
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:34,651
This is Shri Hanumana’s headache, He does it.

550
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:37,068
Anything passes through My mind,

551
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:38,860
He just takes it up and it’s done.

552
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,318
Because as I told you that His whole organization

553
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:44,193
is so well planned;

554
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:46,526
all these messages, from where do they get them?

555
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:48,734
Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”

556
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:51,068
There was a gentleman

557
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:52,734
whose mother was very sick

558
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,442
and he went to see her,

559
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:58,484
and she was just going to die with cancer.

560
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:00,402
So he said, “I didn’t know what to do,

561
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,484
so I just prayed to You,

562
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,484
"Mother, please save my mother.”

563
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,442
Now the sincerity of that person,

564
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:10,609
the depth of that person as a Sahaja yogi Hanumana knows.

565
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:13,818
He knows what is the weight of this person is.

566
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,734
And immediately, you’ll be surprised,

567
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:20,402
within three days the woman who was going to die survived,

568
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:21,526
she got all right.

569
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,110
He brought her to Bombay and the doctor said,

570
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:26,193
“She has no cancer.”

571
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,318
Many things which you call miracles

572
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,860
are done by Shri Hanuman.

573
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:35,860
He’s the one who is the doer of miracles.

574
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:41,402
He does miracles also to show how stupid you are,

575
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,277
how foolish you are,

576
00:39:44,526 --> 00:39:47,442
because He is on the right side,

577
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,442
see He goes to the ego side.

578
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:52,277
Now with the ego a human being

579
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:56,442
is always becomes stupid – that’s, I mean, inevitable.

580
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:59,943
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh, what’s wrong?”

581
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:02,110
And that’s why you will find

582
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,943
many people doing such stupid things,

583
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,484
we can’t understand why they do it.

584
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:07,693
They say, “What’s wrong?”

585
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:12,110
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t like it is the point,

586
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:15,484
and then it recoils.

587
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,402
When they act stupidly it recoils

588
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:22,402
and then they know that we have done such a big mistake,

589
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,442
or it was all stupid.

590
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:28,693
But sometimes it could be extremely, extremely

591
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,734
difficult to retrace back;

592
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:37,402
like the diseases, as I call it the yuppies disease,

593
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:38,860
which is now impossible

594
00:40:39,068 --> 00:40:40,860
because Hanumana has taken away

595
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:42,277
the electromagnetic force

596
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,484
from these people and it doesn’t work,

597
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,402
it doesn’t relate to your conscious mind.

598
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:49,277
So your conscious mind cannot act, it just goes off.

599
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,402
Only these people, if they worship Hanumana

600
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:56,985
with the same devotion, then maybe they might be saved.

601
00:40:57,318 --> 00:40:59,985
But it’s not a easy thing to convince these stupid yuppies,

602
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,442
you see, about anything.

603
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,860
They say, “We don’t believe. So what?”

604
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:05,609
So what, you die – what else?

605
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,943
That’s the only limit, that’s the only life left for you,

606
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,860
and you do that.

607
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,484
There are so many aspects of Hanumana

608
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:19,484
which I could have told you;

609
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:23,526
but for example, for His body,

610
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,068
you see, like Shiva is covered with the gheru.

611
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,818
What you call gheru is a,

612
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:32,693
that’s a kind of a, you know that gheru is,

613
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:38,484
it’s a red-colored stone which is very, very, it is very hot.

614
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:41,526
And supposing with the cold

615
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:45,442
sometimes you develop those rashes,

616
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:48,402
so if you put gheru those rashes are corrected.

617
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,943
Or you get, due to badha sometimes,

618
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:54,402
some sort of skin-diseases which are cured with gheru;

619
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:57,068
because it is the one which is very hot,

620
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,651
and it soothes you down.

621
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,235
On the contrary Shri Ganesha

622
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:04,360
is covered with lead oxide,

623
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,860
with the red lead oxide which is,

624
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,693
which is extremely cold.

625
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:14,693
Lead oxide is a very cold thing.

626
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:17,443
If you touch lead, you see, it’s a very cold thing.

627
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:21,651
So that lead oxide is used to cover all His body,

628
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:28,026
is there to balance the heat that He has,

629
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:30,360
or the effects of heat He has.

630
00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:35,152
So we call this in Sanskrit language is called as sindhura,

631
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:38,152
and also in Marathi or Hindi called shindhura.

632
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:41,693
So they must find always this is the color of that thing;

633
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:47,901
so luckily I got this sari in Vienna,

634
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:52,693
and I have it very nice for this occasion.

635
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:56,235
So He’s always covered with that color,

636
00:42:56,526 --> 00:42:59,442
what you call this sindhur color.

637
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:05,235
And lead oxide, though they say it causes cancer,

638
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:08,360
people say that lead oxide can cause you cancer;

639
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:11,901
but it is the lead oxide which is very cold,

640
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,693
it can cool you down so much

641
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:15,776
that you can go to the left side.

642
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,152
And cancer is a psychosomatic disease,

643
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:21,235
and that might be the reason it might cause,

644
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:23,651
in a very far-fetched way we can say,

645
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,110
can cause cancer to you.

646
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:28,651
Because if it is too cold and all that

647
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,901
and then you go to the left side,

648
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:33,860
and the left side you can catch the viruses,

649
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:36,693
by which you can get into troubles.

650
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:41,110
So, but the same lead oxide is all right for people

651
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:44,734
who are very right-sided.

652
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:48,943
For them if it is put on their Agnya it cools them down,

653
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,402
they are cooled down.

654
00:43:50,651 --> 00:43:53,818
And it’s very good for them to put on their Agnya,

655
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:55,318
so that they are cooled down.

656
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:58,235
Their anger goes down, their temper goes down,

657
00:43:58,526 --> 00:44:00,442
and it’s a very good thing.

658
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,442
So He’s the one who cures our anger,

659
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:09,110
He’s the one who cures our hastiness,

660
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:12,484
our speediness,

661
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,235
our aggressiveness.

662
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,402
He’s the one who does it.

663
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:20,068
Now, He played a trick on Hitler. How?

664
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,193
Hitler was using Shri Ganesha as a symbol,

665
00:44:25,442 --> 00:44:30,193
so this swastika was made in a clockwise manner.

666
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:32,651
Then Hanumana played a trick on him.

667
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,193
What He did, He made the

668
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:42,193
stencil which they were using for making the,

669
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:47,277
what you call the, making the swastika.

670
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:52,152
He put it, somehow or other, lot of – I mean,

671
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:54,860
He made it in such a way that they said,

672
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,277
“We should use the other side.”

673
00:44:56,484 --> 00:45:00,442
As soon as they used the other side – it’s Hanumana’s trick;

674
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,734
I suggested to Him, but I mean, He played the trick

675
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:08,442
– they started using Ganesha from the other side.

676
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:11,152
The same Ganesha about whom

677
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,609
Shri Hanumana was worried how will He,

678
00:45:15,985 --> 00:45:18,068
how can He surpass Shri Ganesha,

679
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,068
because He is the eldest, and how can you go beyond Him?

680
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:26,235
And He is the deity, but Hanumana is an angel.

681
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:29,860
So as soon as the trick was played,

682
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:35,068
then both of them put together stopped Hitler from winning.

683
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:37,651
This is how the trick was played.

684
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,443
So all these little, little tricks, you see, are there.

685
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:45,609
Once I remember I had My Puja in Germany;

686
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:50,110
and Germany is the place where these tricks are played

687
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:51,985
very much by Hanumana,

688
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:54,860
because I have told you that they are the ones

689
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,442
who require Him the most.

690
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,484
So there was in Germany, there was a puja,

691
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:03,360
and in the puja by mistake they put it the other way round

692
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:05,068
– by mistake.

693
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:08,609
I didn’t see. I, normally I always watch very carefully,

694
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,985
but I don’t know why, that day I didn’t see it:

695
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,068
it must be also Hanumana’s trick.

696
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:15,193
And when I saw, I said,

697
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,360
“Oh God, where is it going to now hurt?

698
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,442
Where is it going to work out?

699
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,734
Which country it is going to hit?”

700
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:29,110
It did not hit Germany, it hit England.

701
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,442
Because England, I have worked so hard there

702
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:35,110
and they have been so negligent about Sahaja Yoga,

703
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:39,110
so lethargic about it, that it just went and hit there.

704
00:46:39,442 --> 00:46:44,651
So He is the one who goes like a torrential rain,

705
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:47,443
or can go like a speedy, very speedy

706
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:51,734
tempest and destroy things.

707
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,734
So He works out all these things

708
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,068
through His electromagnetic forces.

709
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:01,193
So all the matter, all the matter

710
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,734
is under His control.

711
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:06,193
All the matter is under His control,

712
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:09,860
and He’s the one who creates rain for you,

713
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,776
who creates sun for you,

714
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:13,818
He creates breeze for you.

715
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,484
He’s the one who does all these things

716
00:47:16,776 --> 00:47:19,484
just to have a proper puja,

717
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:21,526
to have a proper meeting,

718
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:24,442
everything He works out so beautifully.

719
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:27,651
And nobody even knows that it is Shri Hanumana

720
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:28,526
who has done it,

721
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:32,402
and we should thank Shri Hanumana all the time.

722
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:34,901
For the today’s thing, I mean, there are

723
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:38,443
– I, if I have to talk about Him I’ll take hours together.

724
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:43,318
But only thing I have to say that it’s a,

725
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:47,651
such a blessing, I feel, that we have this in this palace,

726
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:50,318
Shri Hanumana’s Puja.

727
00:47:50,443 --> 00:48:01,360
Because He was always a very majestic deity or a angel,

728
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:06,734
and that in a place where it is so majestic

729
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:09,360
and beautifully done, everything is there,

730
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:11,318
and He would like that.

731
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:15,734
He is not a sanyasi type of a person,

732
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:16,860
He’s not an ascetic.

733
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:19,277
Normally right-sided people are ascetic,

734
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:23,318
they become..., they’ll make right-sided people,

735
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,442
they’ll only have everything simple.

736
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:29,152
They would like to shave off their nose also if possible,

737
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:31,360
on the faces!

738
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:36,026
So you see, the other way round, Hanumana is not doing.

739
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,568
Hanumana likes beauty, He likes decorativeness,

740
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:44,693
and He makes people non-ascetic,

741
00:48:44,985 --> 00:48:48,776
so Hanumana gives you this kind of a thing.

742
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,693
But many people who are worshippers of Hanumana

743
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:55,443
always say that those ladies should never go

744
00:48:55,651 --> 00:48:58,026
and take the darshan of Hanuman,

745
00:48:58,442 --> 00:49:00,776
because Hanumana is a brahmachari

746
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,360
– is the one who is, who doesn’t want women to see him

747
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,110
because he doesn’t wear full clothes

748
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:11,026
– and He has very little clothes on Himself,

749
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,110
so He doesn’t want women to see Him.

750
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:15,985
But if women think He is just a child,

751
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:17,443
then it’s just the same.

752
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:21,235
But this idea I think the people don’t have,

753
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:22,443
that He’s a child.

754
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,026
What is for a child how many clothes he wear

755
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:25,901
or doesn’t wear?

756
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:27,026
And then He’s a monkey,

757
00:49:27,235 --> 00:49:28,693
and the monkeys are not supposed to wear clothes.

758
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:30,985
So whatever He wears is quite a lot,

759
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:33,693
and it doesn’t give you even the feeling at all that

760
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:35,901
He’s in any way nude or anything,

761
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,568
but you just see such a sweet form of Him,

762
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,152
such a sweet form.

763
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:44,068
I wish sometimes you’d get His photograph also,

764
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:49,235
as you have got the photographs of Shri Ganesha.

765
00:49:49,484 --> 00:49:51,526
Then you’ll really fall in love with Him,

766
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:52,609
He’s such a sweet thing.

767
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,402
And though He is so huge and so big

768
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:58,609
and though He has nails,

769
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,318
but when He caresses My feet He pulls back His nails.

770
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:05,734
He is so gentle, extremely gentle,

771
00:50:05,985 --> 00:50:08,943
and very beautifully He caresses My feet.

772
00:50:09,193 --> 00:50:12,318
And I have seen Him the way He handles everything,

773
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,526
it’s extremely gentle ways.

774
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:15,985
So that’s what I feel,

775
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:18,193
that now Germans are becoming very gentle

776
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:21,402
in handling things, in handling people.

777
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,985
This change is coming, and I think

778
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:26,442
is the blessing of Hanumana on them.

779
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:29,818
So may God bless you.

780
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:40,443
Now, so today we need not do Ganesh Puja,

781
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:45,693
though a … once you can wash My feet with some song;

782
00:50:46,068 --> 00:50:47,818
because always before every puja

783
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:52,402
one has to do Ganesha Puja, but need not be that elaborate.

784
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:30,398
Just – where is Barbara?

785
00:51:30,572 --> 00:51:32,530
Ask her to get some hot water bottle,

786
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,689
because Ganesha is cooling Me,

787
00:51:34,898 --> 00:51:37,940
the – and Hanumana is cooling Me down completely.

788
00:51:39,658 --> 00:51:40,658
It’s Hanumana, you see,

789
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,033
is cooling Me down completely here from the back,

790
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,817
and just now see how cool it’s becoming, the whole place,

791
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,509
talking about Him.

792
02:56:47,781 --> 02:56:52,198
This is the present from Russia

793
02:56:52,656 --> 02:56:56,531
and here, see now, the color of Hanumana

794
02:56:56,781 --> 02:56:58,656
is exactly like My sari.

795
02:56:59,531 --> 02:57:02,531
And this is Hanumana, the Gabriel, just imagine:

796
02:57:02,781 --> 02:57:05,448
this is a Russian folk story,

797
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:11,115
so Russians knew that He used to wear clothes of this color

798
02:57:11,406 --> 02:57:12,781
– just imagine.

799
02:57:13,198 --> 02:57:17,573
And He’s sitting on a horse,

800
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:22,531
and also it is said that it is Gabriel

801
02:57:22,740 --> 02:57:28,990
who told Mohammed Sahib about the seven...

802
02:57:33,198 --> 02:57:36,990
He gave a horse to Mohammed Sahib

803
02:57:37,198 --> 02:57:42,614
to see to seven Heavens, you see, He gave.

804
02:57:43,573 --> 02:57:47,282
Yes, to see God Almighty on His greatness,

805
02:57:47,573 --> 02:57:48,906
that is the seven chakras,

806
02:57:49,240 --> 02:57:50,990
so Hanumana gave Him.

807
02:57:51,906 --> 02:57:53,448
It’s correct.

808
02:57:53,823 --> 02:57:56,157
Because Mohammed Sahib was on the left-hand side,

809
02:57:56,364 --> 02:58:00,323
He had a Chandra Ma; so He gave Him.

810
02:58:01,448 --> 02:58:03,823
So this is a beautiful piece.

811
02:58:04,531 --> 02:58:06,906
You should keep it there...

812
02:58:07,323 --> 02:58:11,781
But it’s made in Germany, made in Germany.
