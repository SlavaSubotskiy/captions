1
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,770
All these years, I have been waiting, for
this day. We have now, on the 21st Sahasrara,

2
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:32,569
so 
is a very important, turning point as you
know that every 21st day we change our calendars

3
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,839
as far as the horoscope is concerned. And
so now, is a new change has to come. And you

4
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,410
can see the announcement. A new understanding,
an awareness, of a very new dimension. We

5
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,970
have been so far dealing with collective consciousness.
We are collectively conscious. We have, the

6
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:59,209
idea that we are collectively conscious. Also
we know we are part and parcel of the whole.

7
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,480
And that, we all are Sahaja Yogis. We know
about our chakras and our, nadis very clearly.

8
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:34,459
But perhaps we do not know about our powers.
How many powers have developed in those twenty-one

9
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:42,640
years within yourself?[ROAR OF THUNDER OUTSIDE,
SHRI MATAJI SMILES ABOUT IT, YOGIS LAUGH & CLAP].

10
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:59,149
Last two months, Italy was burning with fire,
it was so very hot. And I read reports that

11
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,100
they are worried about a drought and they
want rain to come in and now they think the

12
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,100
time has passed away. But how it works you
see because, the All-pervading Power knows

13
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:27,060
everything and the whole nature works for
your benefit, for your programs. At the right

14
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:36,770
time things happen as you have seen before.
They’re completely coordinated, with our

15
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:45,050
programs. All the time they are helping you.
Whatever they have in them, serves as powers.

16
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:52,050
They are using them at the right time. Now
be confident, that you have powers and this

17
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:06,270
is the new change that is going to come, within
your, own understanding.

18
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,140
So far only you know that you could feel the
vibrations. That you could cure people. You

19
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,600
could help to cure, I mean still not so confident.
That, you could feel the Paramchaitanya. But

20
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:40,310
you did not know what dynamic forces are working
in you now and this is a new change that is

21
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,310
going to come. With this new change you have
to assume a new character. And the new character

22
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:56,709
is announcement. So far I have told you not
to talk about Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly.

23
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,930
But now the time has come. We waited long,
for these days. Now you have to all start,

24
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,660
talking about it, announcing about it and
telling about it to everyone. Otherwise the

25
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,660
world would say that we never knew about it.
All other false gurus are so well known all

26
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,880
over because their disciples are talking about
them all the places wherever they can, to

27
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,880
all the, big offices they go, to big people
they go. They go to all the important people,

28
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,410
just go and tell them what they have.

29
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:48,410
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb
because I wanted you, first of all to develop

30
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,500
into really, very, beautiful Sahaja Yogis
so that from your life, from your life style,

31
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:05,290
from your behaviour, from your understanding,
from your thoughts, people will realise that

32
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:12,290
these people are very unique, and very different
type of people. Now that, assumption, has

33
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:26,160
to be there. You have to understand, that
all these powers are bubbling in you, and

34
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,980
just out of formality or maybe out of shyness,
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding

35
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,740
them.

36
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,740
The other day there was a Sahaja Yogi who
came to My house and he saw some flowers which

37
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:56,130
were fading away. I said, “They are not
fading. You can give them life.” He said,

38
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,329
“How?” I said, “You cut the bottom off
all of them and put your hand underneath.”

39
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,279
And he just put his hands under the base of
the stem and he said, “Mother they’re

40
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,640
still drooping.” I said, “Alright, now
leave them in the water.” His attention

41
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,630
was here and there, within fifteen days they
all stood up. Alright. Roots started growing,

42
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:42,630
they became bigger flowers and lasted for
five days more after that. Then he was convinced.

43
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:55,130
You can do so many things, to convince yourself
that you have these powers.

44
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:02,130
I have seen people who have certain problems.
They have a headache. They have this, that

45
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,670
they come to Me. Write big letters, “Mother
I get my headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

46
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,630
Now those days are gone where Mother has to
cure your headache, look after your wife,

47
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,630
look after your children. Is all finished
now. Now you are responsible, not only for

48
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,990
yourself, but, for your ashrams, for your
cities, for your countries and for the whole

49
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,140
world.

50
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Now assume your powers. Like yesterday he
sang this, or he played the “Royal Court”.

51
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:53,370
So now you are in the Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities. Everybody has to feel

52
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:00,370
responsible and assume, what you are. Know
your powers. What you can do. Sit down. Now

53
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:10,140
the days are gone when you had to sit down
and count your blessings. Now you have to

54
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:17,140
count your powers. How many powers I have
and what I can use and how I can use it. No

55
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,929
use counting your miracles. You have had enough
miracles to prove that you are Sahaja Yogis

56
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:29,880
and that you are helped by the Paramchaitanya.
But now know how much of that Paramchaitanya

57
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,929
you are going to use yourself, how you are
going to maneuver it and how you are going

58
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,450
to work out.

59
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:45,450
This is the new era, we are starting from
today. And this is the day I was waiting for

60
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:54,179
all of you, to realize, that you are not Sahaja
Yogis for only your selfish ends, nor for

61
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:02,770
your families, nor for your communities, nor
for your country, but for the whole world.

62
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:10,620
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you, that I have put many-a-times before

63
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,600
you people that you have to emancipate the
humanity. Now don’t have diffidence. First

64
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,990
of all you should not think that, “We are
very ordinary people. We are very ordinary.

65
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,679
We haven’t got something special about.”
This work is not going to be done by special

66
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,590
people because they are suffering from ego.
It is going to be done by people who don’t

67
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,590
have that ego, of great success, or of great
achievements or riches or anything. If they

68
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:51,120
are rid of this then only they can work it
out. And that’s why it is for you to understand

69
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,120
what Christ has said that a camel can pass
through the hole of a needle but not a rich

70
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,520
man. Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant, any animal

71
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,520
you could think of. That’s why now, as we
are entering into new awareness, let us not

72
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,010
worry about our negative thinking.

73
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:32,010
So first is the diffidence, ”How can I be?
I am not alright. I was like this. I was doing

74
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,610
like this. I had done like this.” So many
letters of confessions come to Me, pages after

75
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,179
pages which I throw away or burn them off.
There is no need to confess anymore. There’s

76
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:51,010
only one confession that, “I am a Sahaja
Yogi and now, after 21st of Sahasrara, I am

77
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:58,010
a Mahayogi.” This is the confession you
have to make and no more of all these out

78
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:06,440
of date things that people tell Me about your
family’s life, all mundane nonsensical things.

79
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,480
We have given them up and we have come to
Sahaja Yoga for our ascent. We have achieved

80
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,480
our ascent and now for what? For what? Have
achieved our ascent is, to emancipate human

81
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,760
beings, to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

82
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,760
The main target I feel today should not be
so much political as fundamentalism. So we

83
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,659
have to openly say to these fundamentalists
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t

84
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,159
know the truth. You don’t know anything
about truth. You don’t know that you are

85
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,929
the spirit. You don’t know that there is
a power that is working.” You have to tell

86
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:56,429
them very clearly, “You are all stupid people
running after something that is a mirage and

87
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,380
all of you will end up into hell as described
by all the scriptures.” We have to openly

88
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,590
say it, these things, which ever way you like.
You may write books. You may publish it. You

89
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:12,270
may tell people about it. But now the new
announcement has to come, to say that, “Running

90
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:19,270
after falsehood is not going to take you to
God.” And, in that they have used the power

91
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,100
of hatred. So you have to say that, “We
believe in the power of love and not in the

92
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:33,100
power of hatred that you believe in.” For
us everybody is capable of finding the truth

93
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,720
and is capable of getting to the, heaven of
that paradise which is promised to us, the

94
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,400
kingdom of God. So for us, everybody, whether
they belong to this community, that community,

95
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,400
this race or that race, whatever it is, we
believe, not that, but we are sure, that we

96
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,220
all are quite capable and blessed by God,
that we should enter into His kingdom. If

97
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,850
you take this kind of a positive attitude
your negativity will go away.

98
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,159
Negative forces, as you know, you have been
pulled down by this kind of a thing or that

99
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,039
kind of a thing. Specially after Sahaja Yoga.
Before Sahaja yoga we are not attached to

100
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,000
any families or anything. After Sahaja Yoga
you just got attached to your families like,

101
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,289
glued to them, absolutely glued. I mean I
had to solve everybody’s family problem.

102
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:39,570
Now we have marriages and even [THE...del],
after marriages, I find still people don’t

103
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,650
understand what is a Sahaja Yoga marriage,
and there are still some problems, very few,

104
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,650
but there are. So this nonsensical problem
of my family, my wife, my children, my house,

105
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:58,530
my property, my money – all this “my”
should be finished first of all. You have

106
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,230
to belong to the world.

107
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:08,230
Any person who is a king does not belong to
his kingdom, is a failure, is useless. If

108
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,760
he thinks about himself, about his own comfort,
about his own fame, about his own achievements,

109
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:23,659
then he’s a failure. He has to think about
the country, on which he’s ruling. In the

110
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:31,460
same way you have to also, turn your mind
away from all these petty things that you

111
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,350
have been dealing with. I’ve been struggling
with you, trying to help you for every small

112
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,409
little nonsensical things. And many people
said that, “Mother, why should you worry?

113
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,100
You are a Saint. Why should you worry about
these things?” I said, “Unless and until

114
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,390
these entanglements are taken away, they are
not going to come up.” But now, now, you

115
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:55,390
do feel that freedom. Complete freedom. You
are an individual. You are absolutely free.

116
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,400
And the source of your joy is your spirit.
You are not entangled with anyone. You are

117
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,400
not any way attached to anyone. In that detachment
you are going to nourish everyone, inclusive

118
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,760
of so-called your family, your people, your
country and ultimately the world.

119
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,760
So to get rid of negativity first, important
thing is to learn detachment. Detachment comes

120
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,890
through thoughtless awareness. When you look
at anyone or start thinking about anyone,

121
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,720
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll

122
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,720
know the solution of the whole problem. Now
the greatest power you have is in your brain.

123
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,470
That you are knowledgeable. Not knowledgeable
the way you understand that what is the chakra,

124
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,270
what is the center. Not that. But there’s
all knowledge within you. Just you have to,

125
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,520
get into thoughtless awareness, and the whole
library of knowledge can open to you. You

126
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,279
know so many of you have never been speaking
on the stage, they had stage fear, and you

127
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,290
have become great speakers. So many of you
were possessed people, who couldn’t even

128
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:18,290
stand before Me, have now become, leaders
and are doing good job. In every field you’ll

129
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,240
find that you have advanced so much. So many
people who never knew how to sing have started

130
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,690
singing. Did not know how to paint have started
painting.

131
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,690
But these are, very very mundane things which
may give us little pleasures here and there.

132
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,950
But the main thing is how many people we give
realization to. Whether you are a woman, whether

133
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,080
you are a man, whether you are a father, whether
you are a mother, whether you are a child

134
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,800
or a grown-up. Everybody has to see how many
people we can give realization to, how much

135
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,740
we can announce about Sahaja Yoga. That’s
the main thing. Sahaja Yoga is not “by the

136
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,490
way”. And it happens. Like when I went to
Australia I was surprised, that, Sahaja Yoga

137
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,110
which was such a prime thing for them, suddenly
became “by the way”. So Sahaja Yoga is

138
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:16,730
a commitment. Is a commitment. And complete
involvement. Otherwise you are really useless

139
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,760
for Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely useless. It’s
better to have few people who are committed

140
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,430
than to have thousands who are just useless.

141
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:32,430
So let us see what you have decided for yourself
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

142
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,470
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga
then just, know that, this is the main thing

143
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:43,840
which you have to do. The whole attention
should be on that. As I told this morning,

144
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,840
a very good poem written by Namadeva and once
was included in the Guru Granth Sahib, that

145
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,100
a boy is playing with his kite and the kite
is flying in the air. He’s talking to everyone,

146
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,260
but his attention is on the kite. There’s
a lady who is doing all the household work.

147
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,260
She’s doing all the cleaning but the child
is [ON HER…del.] on her back or on her waist.

148
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:17,350
All her attention is on the child. Then there
are ladies who are taking water home. There’s

149
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,190
a water pitcher on their heads, sometimes
two, sometimes three. They are carrying, balancing

150
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,490
it. They are talking to each other, laughing.
The whole attention is on the balance.

151
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,320
In the same way your attention should be,
all the time on Sahaja Yoga, “What’s happening

152
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,110
in Sahaja Yoga? Where are we? Where are we
going? Where is Mother? What part She is?

153
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:45,110
What is She doing?” That is, now if you
put your attention to, your negativity, will

154
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,550
absolutely disappear because attention which
was involved into negative things will get

155
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:01,220
absolutely detached and you’ll start thinking
about Sahaja Yoga. So now as you are mahayogis

156
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,190
we have to make it a Mahayoga. And unless
and until that level is achieved by you then

157
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,120
we should think that we are still backdated
and I don’t know in the turning of the wheel

158
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,870
how many will be left, there.

159
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:23,860
So this is very big turning point and today
is a very great day for us because, Sahasrara

160
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:30,860
today, has completed its twenty-one years
and like that it is has twenty-one aspects.

161
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:40,690
Seven the chakras. Seven into three of your
nadis. So it’s twenty-one aspects, you have

162
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:49,130
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.
You just experiment and see for yourself.

163
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,380
Don’t doubt yourself. Just experiment. First
you used to even doubt if there is cool breeze

164
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,100
or not, you used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London. Even London they used to

165
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,790
think there must be air conditioner in their
head. Now those days are gone. Now don’t

166
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:13,790
doubt yourself and just go, full ahead, with
all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.

167
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:21,390
So the maryada has to be there. Except that
the moral maryadas and also, of, behavioral,

168
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:32,910
maryadas, there are not many maryadas in Sahaja
Yoga. You can do what you like, you can live

169
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,920
the way you like, you can eat the way you
want to eat. But the main maryada is that

170
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,920
you have to be very moral people, honest moral
people. And also, you have to be, in a way,

171
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,860
in appearance, in behavior, such a person
that you do not become obnoxious or people

172
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,860
don’t think you are queer, strange, people.
To overcome that, we have to dress up, in

173
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:10,300
a way that is, rather more appealing to the
general public and people see us as normal

174
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,190
human being and as not abnormal human beings.
There’s not much to be done outside. It

175
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,730
is the inside, where we’ll have to prepare
ourselves, fully, to accept ourselves. To

176
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,800
tell ourselves, every day, that we are now
mahayogis and we have to work it out that

177
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,250
way.

178
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,610
Today we have here, people from all over the
world, and you go and tell this message to

179
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,120
all the rest of the people whom I’ve not
met that, “Mother has already announced

180
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,050
- through the Vishnumaya also[MOTHER REFERS
TO THE THUNDER OUTSIDE...ed] - that you all

181
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:50,050
have become now, mahayogis.” And try to
express that. Manifest that. With full confidence

182
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,730
in yourself. And with this power of love I’m
sure you’ll all win over.

183
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:10,460
May God bless you all.

184
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:17,510
There has been nothing written about Sahasrara
before. In none of the scriptures Sahasrara

185
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:24,000
is described. Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.
They just, left it as the seventh chakra.

186
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,340
Finished. They could only go up to Agnya,
and nothing has been written about Sahasrara

187
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:35,340
so far. And there is no, no mantras written
about Sahasrara. So we have to now write Sahasrara

188
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:44,230
Mantra. It is very surprising, that even the
photographs of Sahasraras have appeared now

189
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,890
for you to see, that your Sahasraras are opening
and that is [A...del] something that never

190
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:58,890
happened before, in the whole spiritual history.
And nobody could write about it because, they

191
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:08,390
never saw this Sahasrara. Now for you it is
important to see, that you have something

192
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:15,580
so unique with you. But only thing what you
need is a courage and a complete commitment,

193
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,720
to go forward with this propagation of Sahaja
Yoga, announcement 

194
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:56,160
of 

195
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:06,800
[AFTER PUJA, SHRI MATAJI’S SAYS THAT 

197
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:32,710
HER SISTER WANTS TO TRANSLATE A SONG SHE JUST
SANG OF TUKARAM].
