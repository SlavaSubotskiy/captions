1
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:16,250
EXPRESSION OF SUBTLE ELEMENTS

2
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:33,302
For Sahaja Yogis now it’s very easy
to find out if something is real or unreal,

3
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:37,714
it is truth or untruth, it is love
or hatred.

4
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:41,177
Only through vibrations you can know.

5
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,953
But going beyond that, I’m saying,

6
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:49,560
beyond that one has to know what are
these vibrations,

7
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:53,857
and what are they made of.

8
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:13,665
What is the subtly - subtle force which
is behind those vibrations?

9
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:18,192
We call it is Paramchaitanya; all right,
Paramchaitanya, so what?

10
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,978
What happens to you when you get
Paramchaitanya

11
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:25,433
is something to be understood,
the subtleties.

12
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:32,314
As I said, we are made of five elements,
all right?

13
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:36,399
So, when you get your awakening, when
the Kundalini reaches Sahastrara

14
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,054
and opens out your fontanel bone area,
you become one with the divine Power;

15
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:47,669
then this divine Power Itself starts
flowing through you.

16
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,692
A connection is established.

17
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:56,204
Now when She starts flowing through you,
the Shakti,

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,184
this starts flowing through you, then
what happens?

19
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:08,911
The subtle part we should understand.
The subtle part is like this,

20
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:15,256
that these five elements we are made of,
these vibrations gradually start breaking

21
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:21,956
into the subtler form of which they
are made.

22
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:27,646
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

23
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,771
as it is said that “Word is God.”

24
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:38,114
It’s said also in the Bible, “The Word
is God.” Now what is this Word?

25
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:43,026
Word is a silent, you can say,

26
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:49,045
silent commandment, we can call it
like that.

27
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:53,539
But from that Word comes, according
to Indian philosophy,

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,513
is another thing that we call as bindu.

29
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:07,407
Or we can say Word becomes naad,
is a sound,

30
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:13,482
and then it becomes the bindu: means one -
what you call it, Bindu -

31
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:20,499
is a, one small dot, you can say. 
And then from this dot, you see,

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,759
all these five elements start coming
one after another.

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:33,341
The first element that comes out is light –

34
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:39,495
tej – light, is the first element that
comes out,

35
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:45,754
so the essence of the first element
is light.

36
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:52,943
We call it tej, tejas. Is written of course
in Sanskrit,

37
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:59,446
but we should understand that how the light
pervades Sahaja Yoga

38
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:03,679
so much, and you see the light all around,
everywhere.

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:12,984
So the first element which is light,
and you can say in English,

40
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:25,539
the light’s subtle thing is, we can say,
enlightenment, you can say;

41
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:32,211
but “enlightenment” has another meaning,
so we can say it’s tej, tej.

42
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,169
For example, a person who gets Realization
has a face

43
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,213
which is very radiant, so we can say
the “radiance.”

44
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:46,916
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

45
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:50,863
So this radiance starts showing
on your face.

46
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:54,462
Radiance start expressing itself,

47
00:04:54,662 --> 00:05:01,879
and with that radiance people get
impressed, and they start thinking

48
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,813
something special about this personality
which has radiance.

49
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:09,521
Now you have seen My photographs also
wherever they are,

50
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:14,352
many-a-times you find lots of light around.

51
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:22,621
That is nothing but the light in Me
is giving radiance,

52
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:25,680
because the light becomes subtler.

53
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:31,913
When the light becomes subtler in Me –
light, light is one of the elements –

54
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:36,546
when it becomes subtler then it gives
radiance,

55
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:43,887
and so this is the subtle growth within you
that takes place.

56
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:49,310
Your faces also start shining. 
They too have radiance

57
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,320
and they too have a kind of a different
complexion, I would say.

58
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:04,248
This radiance is to be understood,
is the subtle of the light

59
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,392
of which we are made – light, in the gross
manner.

60
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:15,387
Then after this, from the light, comes
the second thing

61
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:20,980
which we call as vayu in Sanskrit,
meaning the air.

62
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:28,025
So the air that we have, which is gross
air, what is the subtle of air

63
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,875
is this cool breeze that you get.

64
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:35,337
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

65
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:41,856
So the subtle of what you understand
as cool breeze

66
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:48,668
is what we call vibrations, the subtle
of that is air,

67
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:55,326
which is a part and parcel of our making.
So this cool breeze

68
00:06:55,526 --> 00:07:00,976
is the second thing that you start getting
subtler and subtler.

69
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:07,449
When your growth take place, all these
subtle things start expressing themselves.

70
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,086
It’s not only that you get vibrations 
but you get the cool breeze,

71
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:18,281
and that is the subtle of air that has
built you up.

72
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:26,106
Then comes the water. We are also made
of water.

73
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:32,146
What is the subtle of water is –

74
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:44,852
sometimes English language, you know,
becomes little short of expressions, but they call it,

75
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:56,344
I mean, which makes the skin, hard skin
soft. The skin becomes soft.

76
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:05,246
This is another sign of a realized soul,

77
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:10,059
 that his – there’s some cream they use,
there, isn’t it, to soften the face.

78
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,876
This is the minimum of minimum I would say,
but then a person

79
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:21,082
who is a realized soul becomes a very
soft person, very delicate.

80
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:29,621
When he talks to somebody, in his voice
there is warmth, or I should say

81
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:36,458
there is  “jise kehte hein apne yahan pani,
Hindi mein kehte hein pani hona”:

82
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:43,620
the, to have that flow, watery flow
and the coolness of the water.

83
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,322
So that is the another subtle thing that
should be expressed

84
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:53,634
in your behavior, on your skin, on your
dealings with others,

85
00:08:53,834 --> 00:09:05,268
that you should be like the water which is mobile, which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

86
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:09,827
So this also becomes a part and parcel
of your being,

87
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,463
once you become a realized soul.

88
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:20,622
With this water you have also another
thing, it as agni: means the fire.

89
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:24,925
So you also have fire, but is a very
silent fire.

90
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:30,074
It doesn’t burn anybody, but it burns
all the wrong things within you.

91
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:35,719
Whatever wrong things you have it burns, and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

92
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,569
For example, a person comes with a great
anger towards you;

93
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:48,376
what happens, that this anger becomes
cooled down with the fire that is there.

94
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:56,255
Moreover a realized soul cannot get burnt,
fire cannot burn.

95
00:09:56,456 --> 00:10:01,818
The burning cannot come, to him.
It’s very important to understand.

96
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:08,763
Also if you are doing something wrong
it may burn you,

97
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:14,130
but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi and,
I should say, a perfect Sahaja Yogi,

98
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:18,294
fire will never burn you. We have
an example of Sitaji,

99
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,411
that She went into the fire pariksha,
nothing burnt Her.

100
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:29,925
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

101
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:37,795
so the fire and the water, both of them
become sort of divine.

102
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:43,318
For example, the water which you touch,
water you drink,

103
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:51,224
whatever you put your hand in the water,
the water becomes vibrated - means what?

104
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:53,883
The subtlety of the water comes in it,

105
00:10:54,083 --> 00:11:00,349
the coolness, curing power also comes
in that water.

106
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,878
So when it becomes subtler all these
powers start showing,

107
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,917
which you can see for yourself. You don’t
have to experiment.

108
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:18,755
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth.
Is most important, is Mother Earth.

109
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:23,753
There’s a photograph you might see
which was taken in Russia in My dacha

110
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,893
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth,
they have shown clearly.

111
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:33,981
It’s there, and it is the Mother Earth
which shows (it).

112
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:38,107
For example, I have seen flowers, if you
keep them in My room,

113
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:42,624
they blossom. They can become very big
like that;

114
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:47,076
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

115
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:50,967
I’m doing nothing, I’m just sitting down,
and what happens to the flowers?

116
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:56,436
You see now there this principle
of the Mother Earth works,

117
00:11:56,637 --> 00:12:00,436
the subtle Mother Earth is works:
it’s a mother,

118
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:08,000
and that gives you all the nourishment
and makes you grow healthy,

119
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:13,323
and this is how this subtlety works,
of the Mother Earth.

120
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:17,252
Mother Earth is the one who is a giver
of birth

121
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:21,284
to all these flowers and all these trees
and all that,

122
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:24,297
but it also plays a big part in us.

123
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:30,693
It’s not only the Mother Earth that exists
without our connection.

124
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:34,387
And we do not respect the Mother Earth.
We have polluted it,

125
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:37,514
we have done all kinds of things; we have
removed the trees

126
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:41,709
and we have made a mess out of her,
but she is our Mother,

127
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,219
and so many subtle things of this Mother
Earth come into us.

128
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:53,186
One of them is gravity. A person becomes
very attractive,

129
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:58,261
not in the physical sense but
in the spiritual sense.

130
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:03,601
Such a person attracts others. They feel
attracted,

131
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:09,741
and they feel that something specially
is about this person, you see.

132
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:14,396
This is one of the quality of the Mother
Earth. If she had not kept us

133
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:18,766
attracted we would have fallen off 
with her movement.

134
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:25,249
And also other qualities of the Mother
Earth also start manifesting within us,

135
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:35,184
and we become very, I should say
extremely tolerant, patient person,

136
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:39,599
tolerant and patient, extremely tolerant
and patient.

137
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,133
But if you are not tolerant, if you are
hot-tempered and all that,

138
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,894
that Mother Earth principle has not
expressed itself.

139
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,176
Look at the Mother Earth, how much
she tolerates our nonsense;

140
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:56,415
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

141
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:00,628
Only after Realization you are connected
with reality,

142
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:08,098
and you can get the understanding
of all these subtleties

143
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,061
working through you. Why I’m telling
you this,

144
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:15,220
because I want you to know and recognize
yourself,

145
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,475
to understand what you are, what you
have got.

146
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:24,106
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself, you can do a lot.

147
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:28,741
I am here to give you Self Realization,
and the understanding

148
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:33,249
that whatever you have got you must
accept as a challenge.

149
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:36,261
Take it up as a challenge, and you will
be amazed

150
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:40,128
how you will be helped and how you will
get the results.

151
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,353
“Sahaj” doesn’t mean only that you get
spontaneous Realization,

152
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:50,283
it also means you get spontaneity,
the whole nature gets spontaneity.

153
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:55,762
All those subtle things that I have told you, they all get spontaneous and they work it out.

154
00:14:55,963 --> 00:15:02,484
If you take to introspection, you’ll be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers,

155
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:06,940
and you can do wonders. So I bless you all.

156
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:10,215
Please develop those subtle things
within you.

157
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:15,289
They are already there; you don’t have
to do anything, only understand and locate.

158
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,441
Thank you very much.
