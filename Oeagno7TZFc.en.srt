1
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

2
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,520
In the center He resides as Shri Krishna.

3
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,000
On the left-hand side His power, Vishnumaya, His sister, resides.

4
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
There He resides as Gopala,

5
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,200
as the one who lived in Gokul played as a child.

6
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,880
On a right-hand side He resides

7
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,040
as the king who ruled in Dwarika, the king Shri Krishna.

8
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,400
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi Chakra.

9
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,840
The people who use their right side to dominate others,

10
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
use their voice to put down people,

11
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,960
to show their authority,

12
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,920
shout at people,

13
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,760
are the people who get affected by the right side.

14
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,000
The right side is caught up

15
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,360
on the physical side you get a very big problem,

16
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,560
because the Right Heart cannot work out its flow.

17
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,080
So you get what you call asthma and all these diseases.

18
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,520
But specially when the Right Heart is affected

19
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,040
by the fathers problem.

20
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
On the left side is the Vishnumaya,

21
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,240
is the sisterly relationship.

22
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,400
When the sister who is your pure relation

23
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
is not treated as the sister,

24
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,080
when the attitude of a person towards women

25
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,840
is of indulgence and of lust,

26
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,440
then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

27
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,200
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very strongly

28
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,080
and if he has a bad Agya of he has eyes which are roving eyes,

29
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot of trouble.

30
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,280
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you know,

31
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,200
by feeling guilty about things for nothing at all.

32
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,680
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

33
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
But Vishuddhi Chakra has a specialty.

34
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,160
When the humane beings raised their head upward

35
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,440
from Mother Earth towards the sky,

36
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,720
sky is, ether is Shri Krishna's nature,

37
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,800
when it raises head towards the ether, towards the sky,

38
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,000
then this Vishuddhi Chakra developed into a different dimension

39
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
and people started developing ego and superego.

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Superego was already developed,

41
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,640
but ego developed in such a way,

42
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,400
that it started suppressing the superego.

43
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,000
That's how you have got conditionings on one side

44
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,040
of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other side.

45
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,320
When I told you the other day that you give up your free will

46
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,960
in the sense that when you raised your head

47
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,960
you did it through your free will with your power of growing,

48
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,320
that you had as animals.

49
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,640
After that now you have reached to the humane level.

50
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,120
And to rise above the humane level now

51
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,400
you have to do is to seek your complete freedom.

52
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,480
And for that Vishuddhi Chakra is going to help you a lot.

53
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,920
On this Vishuddhi Chakra we have to really pay full attention.

54
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,600
It is such a complicated Chakra.

55
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,800
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari's script

56
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,080
emitting out of the sound

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,240
of the shakti that is passing through it,

58
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,000
of the Kundalini that is passing through it.

59
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,600
So all the vowels are heard on these Chakras.

60
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,440
These vowels are, as you know, sixteen in number.

61
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Without the vowel

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,320
in the Devanagari you cannot write anything.

63
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,400
Vowels are the sustenance,

64
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,120
are the power that

65
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,760
supports every consonant.

66
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,240
So it's very important that our vowels

67
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,360
have to be fully nourished and respected.

68
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,200
The movement of the neck,

69
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,640
as you have seen in all international life,

70
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,680
if you see, everybody has practically the same.

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,040
Even those who cannot hear,

72
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,080
those who do not understand your language,

73
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,080
you can nod like this,

74
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,280
can say, "No", like this.

75
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,200
Everyone understand this is "Yes" or "No".

76
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,160
In some particular area

77
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,600
of course they have little different type of nodding.

78
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,000
But too much of nodding of head is not a very good sign.

79
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,120
I have seen people in the West,

80
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
if you tell them something

81
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
to show that they appreciated it,

82
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,440
they'll go on for quite some time.

83
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,200
That's not necessary.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
Just have to say, "Alright", or "I've understood it", that's all.

85
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
You have to use your voice

86
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,680
instead of nodding like this all the time.

87
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,320
Is very bad, very-very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.

88
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Or some of them are the other way round.

89
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,240
That whatever it is they'll put up their head like this

90
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,480
and they won't talk properly,

91
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,960
they will not say a word, they'll just keep quiet.

92
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,080
You may go on pinching them, doing anything, they won't badge.

93
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,920
This kind of personality is also very much detrimental

94
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,920
to the growth of their evolution.

95
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a very big problem.

96
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,520
Because of Vishuddhi there are so many problems.

97
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
Like angina you develop because of Vishuddhi.

98
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,080
You develop spondylosis because of Vishuddhi.

99
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

100
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,040
Sometimes they have all the time coughing.

101
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,240
And there are so many physical problems

102
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,480
out of Vishuddhi because, as I said,

103
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,160
this a very-very complicated center,

104
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,600
which looks after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteenth

105
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,480
sub plexuses are there, which are looked after by this center.

106
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,640
But above all is the center of discrimination.

107
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,840
The center of discrimination only comes when you are free people.

108
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,960
Till you are biased, till you have your own concept,

109
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
you cannot be discrete.

110
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,680
And that's the one point where one must understand

111
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
that to achieve your complete freedom,

112
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,760
you have to get your Vishuddhi Chakra cleared out.

113
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,160
First and foremost thing is that we must speak in a sweet manner,

114
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,280
speak to someone in a sweet manner,

115
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,920
not artificially, but sweetly.

116
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Speak in a manner that another person likes it.

117
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,720
Saptyam vadeyt, priyam vadeyt.

118
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,000
Speak the truth, don't tell the lies.

119
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
If you go on telling lies after some time,

120
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,880
even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.

121
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,840
But if you are telling the truth,

122
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
that even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

123
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,800
Now some people

124
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,520
think that they can be cunning,

125
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,280
by their talks they can cheat people.

126
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,040
But actually they are cheating themselves.

127
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,840
All such people who cheat others

128
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,640
by sweet talks, by artificial talks

129
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,720
or by some maneuvering

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,680
go to such a horrible state

131
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,640
and in this Kali Yuga specially they are cursed

132
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,560
and they get exposed and people know about them,

133
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,280
that these are the greatest liars ever known.

134
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,400
Now the times are coming

135
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,560
when all such people will be exposed

136
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,040
very much more than they have been ever exposed.

137
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,640
So be careful not to think that you can cheat.

138
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,280
In Sahaja Yoga specially you cannot cheat.

139
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,000
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,

140
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
"We can befool Mother, we can some or other carry on.

141
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,120
If we see in front of Mother She won't know, what we are up to".

142
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
Is not so.

143
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,080
I may not say, I may use My discretion not to say,

144
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,880
I may allow you to have a long way, but be careful.

145
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,320
Do not come into My illusions,

146
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm very illusive.

147
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,560
And when I play My illusions you will suddenly find yourself

148
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,560
in a very difficult situation and then you will say,

149
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,400
"Mother, why am I in this situation?"

150
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna

151
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,760
that He is the one who becomes illusive.

152
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
And His illusiveness not cunning but illusive.

153
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,640
In His illusiveness He exposes people to themselves.

154
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,200
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna

155
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,760
in which He had illusively acted to give

156
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,720
greater joy to some people,

157
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
to give nice lessons to some people

158
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,160
and sometimes to punish.

159
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,400
For us it is important, that we are Sahaja Yogis,

160
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,000
in this lifetime we have a chance

161
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,160
our Kundalini has risen,

162
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,160
that we can face ourselves,

163
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,240
that we can correct our chakras,

164
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,920
that we know about ourselves,

165
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,000
that we know where is the problem is.

166
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,480
I've known of people who were caught up with left Vishuddhis

167
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,080
and have become devilish by nature, devilish.

168
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,080
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

169
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
they have criticized Sahaja Yoga,

170
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
they have tried to trouble Me a lot.

171
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,680
So don't think that if Vishuddhi is spoiled

172
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
there's nothing so special about it.

173
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,800
It can be a very dangerous center.

174
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,080
Of course, Heart, Agya and Vishuddhi, these three centers

175
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,200
one has to guard against

176
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,480
because three of them can allow you

177
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,720
or can force you to become one with identification

178
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
of evil as your own.

179
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,120
You might just feel that it's nice to be evil;

180
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,240
you might just feel that it is a great fun to be evil

181
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,680
and you might become evil.

182
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,880
So at the Vishuddhi Chakra one has to be extremely careful.

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,200
Vishuddhi Chakra you looks after so many things,

184
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,600
specially your skin, your eyes.

185
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,560
Skin is now I've seen people who have bad Vishuddhi

186
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,600
can have all kinds of funny troubles with their skins.

187
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,960
Of course, it has to do with your liver,

188
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,320
but skin is the way it shines,

189
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
the way it glows,

190
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,240
depends on how you smile,

191
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,400
how you look at the world.

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing at all.

193
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Specially women I have seen, ladies I have seen,

194
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
they just smile stupidly.

195
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,840
That's not [inaudible], one should not be stupid.

196
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,840
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna's principle.

197
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
Like you have seen the stupid people, how they are.

198
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,840
Their tongue is always halfway out.

199
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,080
If you have noticed the stupid man,

200
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,000
his face is that, his tongue is always out,

201
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,000
mouth half open and he looks like a dumbfound fool.

202
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

203
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,160
Another one is the one where

204
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,440
you get the Vishddhi's straits.

205
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,200
So such a person has very purse lips,

206
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,920
angry lips and he doesn't talk.

207
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,080
The another one might even get the expression of an idiot,

208
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,880
but could be just making a face like that.

209
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,840
Because if he's cunning he may take a

210
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,200
I would say a kind of a

211
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,080
rupa or... (yogi: "Mask").

212
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Mask you can say, a mask on his face,

213
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,800
that he is an idiot and make high to deceive you.

214
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,040
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

215
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,240
Whatever may be the expression of a person,

216
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,560
a person may look very innocent.

217
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,440
Because that's the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

218
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,920
You are free because you've raised your head

219
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,160
and this point you have achieved, this kind of a special aptitude

220
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,960
that you can deceive yourself and you can deceive others.

221
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,360
Some people look extremely innocent on the face.

222
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,080
They may look to be very simple people,

223
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,040
but may turn out to be horrid.

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Some people may look to be idiotic,

225
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
but may be very intelligent.

226
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,360
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi

227
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
which is, which is responsible.

228
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,200
But the main thing what I'm trying to tell you,

229
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,680
that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi.

230
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
The way you want to put your expression,

231
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,800
the way want you make your face,

232
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,960
the way you want to suggest something,

233
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
all you can maneuver

234
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,400
and you can keep your heart away from it.

235
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
In the heart you may have poison for a person,

236
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,560
but outwardly you may say

237
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,560
to that person in a very sweet manner something

238
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,480
that a person might feel impressed.

239
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,600
But in this all this behavior, pattern of behavior,

240
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,880
you are deceiving yourself, not deceiving the another person.

241
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
Because yourself is Spirit,

242
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,800
which knows you very well.

243
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,200
And this will go on and on

244
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,760
for all your lives that have to come.

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,840
So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression,

246
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,720
there is no need to hide anything in your expression.

247
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
Of course, I mean, if you don't like someone

248
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,920
you need not just say, "I don't like you",

249
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,080
but in that case you have to be

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,320
not also so much appreciative of the person,

251
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,280
that he's deluded into your appreciation.

252
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,280
Now, eyes are very important

253
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,240
and eyes in a way are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

254
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
because the muscles of the eyes

255
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,240
are looked after by Vishuddhi.

256
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,400
And the kind of the muscles we have

257
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
which pull our eyes,

258
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,880
which close our eyelids and all that is very much suggestive.

259
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,840
You must noticed that there are some people who come to Me,

260
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,720
their eyes go on like this.

261
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,120
When they close their eyes, they cannot keep it shut.

262
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,680
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me

263
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,440
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

264
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,240
Both are in trouble.

265
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,880
The ones which are the ones,

266
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

267
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,440
are the people having supraconscious.

268
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,080
And those who flicking their eyes are having the subconscious.

269
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,240
Some people have also

270
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,640
habit of eh keeping the eyes in an angle all the time

271
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,000
they never see you straight,

272
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,320
but in angle they'll see.

273
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
Ah, they think it's sometimes it's very fashionable sometimes,

274
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,400
ladies think it's a very good way of looking at people

275
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,680
and some of them have such eyes

276
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,120
that they'll go on and looking and boring

277
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,200
their greedy eyes onto others,

278
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,480
or their lusty eyes onto others.

279
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,440
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes,

280
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,400
because such people are easily can become blind.

281
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Such people might have trouble of the eyes.

282
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,120
Specially reddening of the eyes

283
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,040
can come to such people

284
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,360
very much, very quickly.

285
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,920
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure.

286
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,800
The eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

287
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,680
He was a witness,

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,520
He, He was on this Earth,

289
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,000
He play, He played with Radha. He married five women,

290
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,880
they were the five elements.

291
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,960
Sixteen thousand women He married,

292
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,000
they were His sixteen thousand powers,

293
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
but He was Yogeshwara.

294
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
He was Yogeshwara;

295
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,920
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them, at all.

296
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,000
He was beyond them, He was Yogeshwara.

297
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,120
That was the testing point of His,

298
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,760
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

299
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,800
Such an Yogeshwara is there!

300
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,640
Of course, I don't expect you to be Shri Krishna.

301
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
But you have your wife.

302
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,800
Those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

303
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,000
That we'll get wives and will be,

304
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,080
ah, we'll have a wife and think of a wife,

305
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,400
who will be your own

306
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,520
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

307
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,680
who comes across ah with that kind of a thing.

308
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,000
I've seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

309
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
it's surprising, I mean, there's nothing in the photograph,

310
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,720
what is in a photograph?

311
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,360
But even a photograph can attract their attention,

312
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,240
I mean, I don't know what can attract their attention like this.

313
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,600
But they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes.

314
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,240
No control, they become absolutely lost and they have no control.

315
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
That shows that they have no powers in them

316
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,960
and they are slaves of their responses.

317
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,880
For the eyes are very-very important as Christ has said,

318
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,880
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

319
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
There should be no adultery.

320
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,160
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see.

321
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
If they have to show anger with their eyes

322
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,480
they'll just go on looking like this and show the anger.

323
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,000
I need there not do that to you, but.

324
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,920
And the angry eyes you see are another dangerous things

325
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
to do with your eyes,

326
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,680
because then they can become mesmeric.

327
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,400
If you start putting your eyes onto something

328
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,800
and concentrating on it your eyes might become mesmeric

329
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,160
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

330
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
First of all you'll catch bhoots in your eyes,

331
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,440
they'll settle down there and then

332
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,040
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

333
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
It's a very-very dangerous thing

334
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,480
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

335
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,120
There's another kind of a stupid thing or a bhootish thing maybe,

336
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,760
that people ask you to meditate here. It's absolutely wrong.

337
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,160
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

338
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,120
Nobody should put attention here.

339
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,000
Instead of put attention, put attention at the door.

340
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,840
What's the use of looking at a window?

341
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,480
You can't get out of it, can you?

342
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,720
If you have to look at anything be on a lookout for the door.

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,640
And the door is here.

344
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,200
The door of Sahasrara is to be open out.

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,000
So you should not try to concentrate on this path.

346
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,120
Many people who have concentrated on this path have become mad.

347
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,880
When they become mad, people say,

348
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,240
"These are Yogi but has got [SOUNDS LIKE - unmanitasha]."

349
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,040
That he moves like a madcap.

350
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,480
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

351
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,480
That means he's united with God. Is He mad?

352
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,880
All such mad people are really mad,

353
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
they've nothing to do with God, definitely.

354
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,560
But there are people who believe in such things,

355
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,640
"Oh, he is in love with God,"

356
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,280
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into ecstasy,

357
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,880
dances like a madcap.

358
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,320
How can God be mad?

359
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,040
First position is this that the sanest personality is God,

360
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
has to be.

361
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,480
From where do the sanity comes?

362
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
So this is one thing one has to understand,

363
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,720
that any such practices

364
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,840
can lead you to lunacy and one should not doing.

365
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,160
Thirdly in the indiscretion that one has

366
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,000
comes from people who are good hearted, nice people,

367
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,600
but they get kind away by the smiles of others

368
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,840
or by the artificial goodness they show on their faces.

369
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,760
I've known some people, they always have a face like

370
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,120
as if they are all the time smiling.

371
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,680
No, I can't do that way.

372
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,520
All the time if you look at someone like this, you see.

373
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,440
It means as if you are mocking at the person.

374
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,040
And there are people I've seen who just like this

375
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,680
all the time have them [lips] like this.

376
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
So, one should not be always in one pose.

377
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,920
Sometimes this muscles can get very weak

378
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,320
and start paining if you take one.

379
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
There are some others

380
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,440
who always try to show they are very miserable.

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
I don't know what do they want to attract.

382
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,520
Attract the attention of others,

383
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,160
attract ah the bhoots in themselves

384
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,160
or I don't know what are they up to,

385
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,800
why can't they keep a normal face.

386
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,760
Even while sitting in dhaan, or meditation,

387
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,240
I've seen that trying to show Me or may whatever it is,

388
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,560
because My eyes are mostly closed, but doesn't matter.

389
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,240
When I open My eyes I find some people like this, like that.

390
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,680
Why? What is the need? You have to have a balanced face.

391
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,800
That's what Shri Krishna had described the Sthita Pragya,

392
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,920
One who is balanced,

393
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,120
who doesn't laugh like an idiot,

394
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,720
who laughs, but not like an idiot.

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,760
Nor he's a serious like another kind of an idiot.

396
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
So both the things are not at all

397
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,360
expression of your inner being.

398
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,920
Such a person is, as I told you today,

399
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,960
is not frivolous, but not serious either,

400
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,920
but full of joy within himself.

401
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,720
He doesn't want you to be unhappy,

402
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,880
never would like that you should be unhappy people.

403
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,760
But human beings if they want to be unhappy,

404
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
what can anybody help,

405
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
because they have got the free will to be unhappy.

406
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
They have got a free will to cut their nose,

407
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,600
they've a free will to cut their ears,

408
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,280
they've a free will to commit suicide.

409
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
They have this free will so-called.

410
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,680
Now the greatest freewill comes from Vishuddhi Chakra,

411
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,600
as I told you and that's why we call Him Yogeshwara,

412
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

413
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,240
The establishment of Yoga is possible

414
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,920
when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

415
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,120
Completely surrenders yourself to Shri Krishna.

416
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,920
Your Yoga will be established. Means what?

417
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,680
Means all your balances will be established.

418
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,400
You go into complete balance

419
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,920
and that balance is complete because Vishnu,

420
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,400
Who is the Incarnation for sustaining the dharma,

421
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Who is responsible for giving you the balance,

422
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,280
becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna.

423
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,120
That's why He said that, "You leave all the dharmas

424
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,600
[SOUNDS LIKE - sarva dharma nam partitte jam ma meik shana wraja]",

425
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,000
that's why surrender all of them to Me.

426
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,480
So all the dharmas if you put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna,

427
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,400
means if you follow His ideals,

428
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,040
then all your dharmas are balanced.

429
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,400
But after Realization you go beyond dharma.

430
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,920
Whenever you go wrong in dharma,

431
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,480
[SOUNDS LIKE - dharmatchutta] as they call it,

432
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,000
when you go wrong in dharma,

433
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
that's the time you have to surrender yourself to Shri Krishna,

434
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
so that He establishes your dharma.

435
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,000
There are so many dharmas.

436
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,240
There is the pati dharm -

437
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,280
husbands dharma, patni dharma - wive's dharma,

438
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,120
father's dharma, mother's dharma, son's dharmas,

439
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,800
the [SOUNDS LIKE - rashtra] dharma - means the nations dharma.

440
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also

441
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,480
of we can say ah where one has to bow

442
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,720
to the higher things of life.

443
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,480
But then He says, "[SOUNDS LIKE - Sarva dharma anam pari tedg]"

444
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,360
"Forget all the dharmas."

445
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,920
"[SOUNDS LIKE-Maa meikam charanam gachchhami ]", -

446
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,800
"Just surrender your dharmas, all of them to Me",

447
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
that is at Vishuddhi.

448
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,920
At Vishuddhi Chakra you surrender all your other dharmas.

449
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,440
It means that it all gets sublimated,

450
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,280
it all gets complete, the wholesomeness is achieved

451
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,920
because He is collective being,

452
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
He is the Virat,

453
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:24,680
because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas

454
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,720
and He is the Virata in our brain.

455
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,480
He represents our brain.

456
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,280
And when this Virat in us is awakened fully,

457
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,400
then all the dharmas become natural with us.

458
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,120
We don't have to do any dharmas,

459
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,720
we don't have to be conscious of any dharmas,

460
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,880
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

461
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,840
For example, there are people now, say, Christ;

462
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,240
we can take example of Christ.

463
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,240
He was dharma personified.

464
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,400
He would not steal money from anybody, will He?

465
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,200
Will He run away with somebody's wife, will He?

466
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
When He do anything wrong? No, He cannot.

467
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Why? Because He was Dharma.

468
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,000
So now you have become dharmateet,

469
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,040
means you have entered into the kingdom of God,

470
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,600
into the Virata's conditions

471
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,840
and there your condition is such that your state is such,

472
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,560
your state is such, that you are dharma.

473
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,880
If you try to do adharma, you'll suffer.

474
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,480
If you try to do wrong, you'll suffer.

475
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,480
Here I don't have to tell you to be righteous;

476
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,760
I don't have to tell you, there's no need.

477
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,800
I don't have to tell you that you tell the truth.

478
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,920
I don't have to tell you, "Don't steal".

479
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,240
I don't have to do all these things.

480
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,680
Only thing I can tell you

481
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,640
that get rid of your ego and superego, that's all.

482
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,800
In a very general terminology.

483
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,080
But you will follow Christ automatically,

484
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,640
you will follow Krishna automatically, Sahaj,

485
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,000
because now you have gone beyond dharma,

486
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,560
you have crossed the limits of dharma

487
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,720
where you had to follow a dharma,

488
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,080
now you have become the dharma.

489
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,520
Where you will stand, wherever you will be

490
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
dharma will stand with you.

491
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,600
People will look at you and say, "Here is a dharma standing,

492
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,000
he's the dharma to be worshipped".

493
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,120
Not because of anything but because your state

494
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,520
is that of dharma, you have gone beyond that.

495
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,440
Supposing this is loudspeaker I'm using today to talk to you.

496
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,440
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part and parcel of Me,

497
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,640
I don't have to use this, I go beyond it.

498
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,080
In the same way

499
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,400
you are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself.

500
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,400
But when you go beyond dharma

501
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
into the state of Virata,

502
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,760
then you don't need any dharma,

503
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,160
you become the dharma of Virat.

504
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,080
Now, what is the dharma of Virat,

505
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,200
what is the dharma of Shri Krishna

506
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,880
is collectivity.

507
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,520
Krishna

508
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,560
is the Brain.

509
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,880
Shiva is the Heart

510
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,760
and Brahmadeva is the Liver.

511
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,920
Now what's the faculty of this brain is?

512
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,400
That the tree of life of evolution grows downward as He says.

513
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,760
And this tree is growing downwards

514
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,320
of awareness from the brain.

515
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,080
But if you have to go to the roots

516
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,680
you have to ascend and that ascent you have achieved,

517
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,560
now you have gone to the roots of your brain

518
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,320
where all your roots are enlightened,

519
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,160
all your nerves are enlightened,

520
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,560
your brain is enlightened,

521
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,520
you are an enlightened person.

522
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,840
When you are in darkness

523
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,800
you may catch hold of a snake as rope,

524
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,600
but when you are in light you will drop it.

525
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,840
In the same way, when you become enlightened,

526
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,720
your dharma is enlightened.

527
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
You don't have to take to any guru

528
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,880
or to any book or to anyone,

529
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,360
you know yourself in your own life that this is wrong.

530
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Now the collectivity part of it is very important.

531
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,920
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

532
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,240
Not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all.

533
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
Collective in the sense

534
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,120
that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

535
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,720
who tries to find faults with someone all the time,

536
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,640
wants to run away with his wife

537
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,640
and'll stay somewhere else or with her husband,

538
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,880
who wants to get out, is not a person who's collective.

539
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,560
There's no need to say

540
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,960
that, "I cannot live under the circumstances

541
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,520
in which Sahaja Yogis can live".

542
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,960
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if are a Yogi, you can live.

543
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,880
Look at Me, I'm such an old woman, I can live anywhere.

544
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,360
You take Me to a village,

545
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
you take Me to any place I'm not bothered

546
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,040
about any physical comforts at all.

547
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,080
Because I'm comfortable within Myself.

548
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
My comforts are within.

549
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,920
In the same way, a person who is not collective,

550
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,440
like many people just come to Pujas, that's all.

551
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,080
It's like going to the church only once in Christmas

552
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,800
and then say, "Christ doesn't look after us".

553
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,560
Of course, not going to church and you don't meet Christ,

554
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,080
but I mean to say that just to have a casual way

555
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,560
of Sahaja Yoga you cannot gain.

556
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,800
You have to be collective.

557
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
And collective means

558
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,120
that at every collective program you should be there.

559
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,880
You should always meet collectively,

560
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
meditate collectively, live collectively,

561
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,080
and try to find ways and methods of being collective.

562
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
There are so many evil forces,

563
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,120
which are all the time trying to attack collectivity.

564
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,760
First they will attack the leaders.

565
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
That's the first thing.

566
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,680
Any leader tell somebody, "You shouldn't do like this",

567
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,880
immediately that person will start spreading stories against,

568
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,480
"That leader is very bad, he's like this, he's very harsh.

569
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,680
He didn't garland me, he didn't give me this, that".

570
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,360
How can you garland a bhoot, can you?

571
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,040
That if that in that ah doesn't work out

572
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,680
then they have their sly methods

573
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,640
of going round and talking something here and there

574
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,960
in the ears to create some sort of a politics.

575
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,840
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

576
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,000
As there is a centrifugal and a centripetal force,

577
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,480
both acting equal and opposite.

578
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,520
Anybody who goes against collectivity,

579
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,960
who sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity

580
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,960
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga

581
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
and that's is to be remembered,

582
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,560
that to be collective is to be joyous,

583
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,200
is to be progressive, to be going further.

584
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,960
It was alright when people were meditating in the Himalayas.

585
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,720
It was alright at that time they were all alone,

586
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
meditating all alone,

587
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,080
to achieve something for the collective.

588
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,240
But they also did not get their Realization.

589
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,680
When you have got your Realization remember this.

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,520
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

591
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,520
into the Kingdom of Virat

592
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,760
where you are a part and parcel of a collective being.

593
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,640
You are not alone, you cannot be single out,

594
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,680
you cannot separate yourself.

595
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
Now you are awakened in the body of Virata

596
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,840
and you cannot get out of it.

597
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,920
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be nourished.

598
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,280
Supposing, I take out part of My body.

599
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Will it be nourished by this body? It won't.

600
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,280
In the same way you have now become

601
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,760
part and parcel of that collectivity

602
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,080
and that collectivity that Virat is going to look after you,

603
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
going to nourish you,

604
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,760
going to do the everything that is necessary

605
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,560
for your spiritual, physical, mental, emotional,

606
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,000
even financial development.

607
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,960
But if you cut it short, if you

608
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,000
try to block the collectivity,

609
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,080
if you try to make problems for collectivity

610
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,760
or even if you try just to get out of the collectivity,

611
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
then that is not our interest, that is not our work.

612
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,280
This is to be understood fully,

613
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,680
in every way possible

614
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,800
and this when is understood in a proper way,

615
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
you should know that

616
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,400
collectivity is not only your advancement,

617
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,880
is not only your development,

618
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,640
is not only your achievements,

619
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,600
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

620
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,960
The purpose of your creation

621
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,560
is fulfilled by that.

622
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,360
Those people who live in the ashram

623
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,160
are better of always, than the people who live alone, always.

624
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,520
They will always have better results,

625
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,680
than the people who live alone.

626
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,160
Maybe they live alone

627
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,040
because they want to have a little private life or a privacy.

628
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,280
But their privacy is not going to help them.

629
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,400
That's not going to help them at all.

630
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,280
The more we live together,

631
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,080
the more you reside together,

632
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,520
the more you enjoy together,

633
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,040
there will be greater chances of your advancement.

634
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,040
The more you will try to make yourself private,

635
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,920
the more you'll try to get out of it,

636
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,400
whatever explanation you may give,

637
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,960
God understands, very well.

638
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,520
So all such things where you cut off yourself

639
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,200
from the mainstream,

640
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,120
you try to get out of the main stream,

641
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,880
then there is a big problem for you.

642
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,200
Of course, for certain conveniences you may,

643
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,680
for your certain understanding you may,

644
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,520
but you should enjoy more the company of Sahaja Yogis,

645
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,920
than your own private company

646
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,320
in the dingy room of yours.

647
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,520
That is one thing you can judge yourself.

648
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,600
Do you all enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis

649
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,120
or you enjoy the company

650
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,360
of three-four of your family people together in a circus.

651
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,920
Judgment is your own.

652
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,200
Yogi "A difficulty Shri Mataji".

653
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,360
Nothing is difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,920
It is the simplest thing to be a Sahaja Yogi.

655
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,320
And even more simple to be collective.

656
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,400
To be uncollective you have to do something.

657
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Like I said that it is very easy not to drink.

658
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
Mean, I mean, drink some wines and things.

659
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,440
Because if you don't want to drink you are sitting at home,

660
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,960
it's alright, don't have to do anything.

661
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,480
But supposing you have to drink,

662
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,160
then you have to go a pub or you have to go somebody,

663
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,880
open the bottle, get a particular type of a glass,

664
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,160
pour it down, this, that.

665
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,360
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,

666
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
you are sitting with a fright.

667
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,360
But for a person who just drinks water he doesn't have to do it.

668
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,080
So to do wrong one has to do something.

669
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,400
But to be good you don't have to do much.

670
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,080
Is absolutely labor saving, energy saving process

671
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,600
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see,

672
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,440
I ah want to harm somebody,

673
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,280
I'll have to go out of the way to find out ways, methods.

674
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,240
If I to tell lies I have to think of ten lies to cover that one lie.

675
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
But if I tell the truth, finished,

676
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,000
I am still I've told the truth, finished, with few words it's done.

677
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,760
So to be collective is much more easier.

678
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,400
Of course, not for crooked people,

679
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,560
because crooked people whenever they move

680
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,080
their angularities trouble others.

681
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,080
You see, like ah ah poking ah of thorns.

682
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,040
But those who are flowers they fitting anywhere,

683
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,040
people like them.

684
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
They like their fragrance,

685
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,320
they look at them, they enjoy them beautiful things.

686
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,840
Now see, today they are looking like lotuses.

687
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,960
How is it? Without doing anything they have become lotuses.

688
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,840
How? How they have become like lotuses?

689
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,200
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies God only knows.

690
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,280
But they have become lotuses Sahaj.

691
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,000
How? Because they are one with God.

692
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,640
When we stand in our own way,

693
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,640
when we try to do something privately,

694
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,480
then God said, "Alright, go private'.

695
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,400
But when we are public He looks after us.

696
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,440
And then in Sahaj Yoga, as you know,

697
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,320
that collective growth

698
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,240
is the only way we understand Sahaj Yoga.

699
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,480
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something else,

700
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
somebody knows something else.

701
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,080
When we are collective,

702
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,400
then we really understand every aspect of Sahaj Yoga.

703
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,000
Supposing, there is somebody a scientist,

704
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,760
somebody is a musician,

705
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,320
somebody is another thing.

706
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,240
We cannot know everything.

707
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,000
So you know something from this one,

708
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,280
something from that one,

709
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,720
something from that.

710
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,080
So all the rivers has it's flowing into that collectivity

711
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,200
and you enjoy the ocean of these ah rivers.

712
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
You don't have to go to all the rivers in India,

713
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,560
like you go from Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Kaweri

714
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,920
you thousands of lives.

715
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,320
Go to the sea, all of them are there.

716
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,280
Like that you have to enjoy the sea where everything meets.

717
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,480
All kinds of beautiful things are there and you enjoy that.

718
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,000
I hope this Puja which is a very remarkable Puja.

719
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,320
Firstly so many things are Sahaj.

720
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,560
Firstly they told Me

721
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,480
the telephone number of this place is 32 16 32.

722
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,760
He, He's accompanied by 64 Yoginis, Shri Krishna.

723
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,600
So 32 on this side and 32 on that side and He sitting here

724
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,720
This place is called as Black ah Lake.

725
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,960
Krishna is black.

726
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,320
This place they got suddenly

727
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,640
and this is the only place in this

728
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,200
so-called military regime of Switzerland

729
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,760
where people can sleep on the ground.

730
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,960
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

731
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,600
If there's no cot you hang in the

732
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,880
air, but you cannot touch the ground.

733
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,000
That kind of the stupid military business is here.

734
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,240
Where to find such a sensible, practical,

735
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,280
such a cheap place for you is godsent.

736
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,040
We are here surrounded by beautiful things with the cows,

737
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
so many cows at the time when it is Krishna's birthday.

738
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,320
So many cows, so fond of cows

739
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,720
and the cows when they their bells

740
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,000
move in the morning I heard, in the evening so beautiful

741
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,840
and when they are moving home in the evening

742
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,440
how the as they call [SOUNDS LIKE -guraj] -

743
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,640
is the dust of their feet was filling the sky

744
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,360
is just Gokul here I felt.

745
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,200
Today also there's one thing more one has to say,

746
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,080
that is the sixteenth Shri Krishna Puja.

747
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,680
So in so many ways this is a very great Puja

748
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,560
which you are attending for which

749
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,360
people have to take thousands and thousands of janmas (births)

750
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,040
do so many punyas, which you have got so Sahaj,

751
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,920
because there must be something about you people also.

752
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,400
May God bless you.

753
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,120
Now, what are we decided?

754
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,400
Now they have got ah mantras

755
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,880
written in Sanskrit that

756
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,120
and 108 Names of Shri Krishna [NOT AUDIBLE] they got.

757
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,680
The one, one Rustam has done them in Sanskrit

758
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,600
and Gregoire has done them in.

759
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,880
I think everybody's hearing Me, aren't you?

760
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,480
And Gregoire has because you have to hear Me from Sahastrara,

761
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,880
you can.

762
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,840
And Gregoire has done in English language.

763
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,000
So we'll have

764
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,800
two types of Sanskrit and English words,

765
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,400
describing Shri Krishna's nature.

766
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,000
"Now today let the all the Sagittarius to [INAUDIBLE- My Puja?].

767
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,080

768
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,720
