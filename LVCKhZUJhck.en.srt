1
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,920
Today we are going to perform the Puja of Shri Raja Rajeshwari.

2
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,880
Especially in the south of India,

3
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:48,999
the Devi is recognized in many forms.

4
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:56,040
The reason is that here

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,680
there were many Devi bhaktas (devotees of the Goddess), like Adi Shankaracharya,

6
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,999
and they established the religion of Shakta Dharma.

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,360
Shakta Dharma means the religion of Shakti (God's power).

8
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:25,760
Two kinds of religions started simultaneously.

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,160
Ramanujacharya established the Vaishnav religion,

10
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,720
and

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,600
while following two kinds of religions, people got separated.

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,160
The one who is truly Vaishnav (following the Vaishnav religion),

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,720
his work is of Mahalakshmi.

14
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,440
And Mahalakshmi ji

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,080
who has many forms,

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,800
assimilates all those forms within Herself;

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,999
like Dharma,

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,640
establishing the Dharma

19
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,360
and being in the middle path,

20
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:37,280
going neither to the left nor to the right,

21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,999
but being in the center.

22
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:44,000
Such people are called Vaishnavas.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,080
As time passed,

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Vaishnava Dharma spread in Gujarat and other (states of India).

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,999
When one goes through the Vaishnav path,

26
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,360
through Kundalini,

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,999
then at the end you reach Sahastrara,

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,760
but at Sahastrara,

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,920
at the Brahmarandra, is the seat of Sadashiva.

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,480
So by following Vaishnava Dharma, at the end,

31
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,680
one reaches Sadashiva,

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,440
who is also the goal of Shakta Dharma.

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
But one must understand that the power of Kundalini,

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Kundalini Shakti,

35
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,480
passes through the central path.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,640
So how can you separate the two (Shakta and Vaishnava Dharma)?

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,400
The path of Shakti is the central path.

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,999
Both the things which were interwoven together were separated,

39
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,440
the reason being

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,760
that in those days the ascent of Kundalini didn't take place.

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,240
In Maharashtra, in Kolhapur there is a temple of Mahalakshmi,

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,999
where She is awakened.

43
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,960
There people sing, "Uday uday Ambe."

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
Amba is the Shakti.

45
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:34,520
Kundalini is called Amba.

46
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,400
So in that temple of Mahalakshmi

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,400
they sing about awakening the Shakti.

48
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
They don't know why they sing this (bhajan).

49
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,880
So the Vaishnavas make their path (of evolution),

50
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:57,040
make the route, the path,

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
and when that path is ready,

52
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,120
then the Kundalini rises through it.

53
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:12,440
We also do the same in Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,999
When you all put your hands towards Me,

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,480
then slowly all your seven chakras get all right,

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,560
which means that you become a Vaishnav.

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
From extremes you come to the central path,

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,999
and your chakras settle down properly.

59
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,999
When your chakras are corrected,

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,000
only then Kundalini is awakened.

61
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,480
So that’s why initially you become Vaishnav

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,999
and then you become Shakta.

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,880
So, both of them are one (Vaishnav and Shakta religion).

64
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,999
But in the south (of India)

65
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,200
many aspects of the Devi are recognized,

66
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,999
and out of these (aspects), Raj Rajeshwari is worshipped a lot.

67
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,999
The Lakshmi

68
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,640
is on the Vaishnav path, on the path of Vishnu, wife of Vishnu,

69
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,160
and that’s why

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,760
this aspect of Lakshmi was explained,

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,240
which is an aspect of Shakti itself.

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Raja Rajeshwari means

73
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,240
that Kundalini comes to Nabhi.

74
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
When Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

75
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,520
it acquires the form of Lakshmi,

76
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,560
or gets the reflection of Lakshmi on it.

77
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,999
When this Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

78
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,999
then She takes the form of Lakshmi,

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,999
It takes the form of many kinds of Lakshmi:

80
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Gruha Lakshmi, Raja Lakshmi.

81
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,999
There are many Lakshmis,

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,999
but Lakshmi takes these forms

83
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,999
when it gets the Shakti of Kundalini.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,600
They are enlightened only through the union with Kundalini Shakti.

85
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,999
So though Raj Rajeshwari is the power of Kundalini only,

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,200
it takes this form when Kundalini reaches Nabhi chakra.

87
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,999
Then Kundalini itself is recognized as Raj Rajeshwari.

88
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:07,200
Or we can say that the aspect of Adi Shakti at Nabhi chakra

89
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,999
is called Raja Rajeshwari.

90
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,760
Now the person who has at Nabhi chakra

91
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,160
the principle of Raja Rajeshwari established,

92
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,999
means that he has Gruha Lakshmi established on the left side

93
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,999
and Raj Rajeshwari on the right side.

94
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:40,760
The highest state of Raja Lakshmi
is considered to be Raja Rajeshwari.

95
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,240
Now at the last stage of Raj Rajeshwari,

96
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,320
how should a Sahaj Yogi be?

97
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,360
The blessings of Lakshmi have to be there, at this stage.

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,600
After Kundalini awakening, a person

99
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,999
receives the blessings of Lakshmi.

100
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,480
They have to come definitely.

101
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,400
All the Sahaj Yogis receive the blessings of Lakshmi,

102
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,999
and sometimes this Lakshmi

103
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,800
can increase a lot, unexpectedly.

104
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
And even if it does not increase,

105
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,999
such a man gets the attiutude of a king.

106
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,880
Until your attitude becomes like that (attitude of a king),

107
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:51,800
you must understand that the Kundalini is still lost at Nabhi.

108
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
The temperament changes!

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,040
The biggest miracle which happens after coming to Sahaj Yoga

110
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,240
is that a person's temperament changes,

111
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
his nature changes.

112
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,440
A man who is full of a-Lakshmi,

113
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,560
within whom Lakshmi is not visible,

114
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,680
- means there are many rich people also,

115
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,080
who are miserly.

116
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:25,320
So they cannot be called as Lakshmi-pati.

117
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,400
There is no form of Lakshmi visible in them.

118
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,960
They live like beggars, all the time crying for money.

119
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,999
It's very difficult for them to give some money to others.

120
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,999
In such miserly people,

121
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Kundalini has not yet awakened.

122
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,999
They die of miserliness.

123
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,960
They are so miserly, and think so much about money

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,640
that their liver can also get destroyed.

125
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,360
Their face will be just like a beggar.

126
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,960
So just to achieve the Lakshmi (material wellbeing)

127
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,240
is not the work of Kundalini.

128
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:21,999
To establish the essence of Lakshmi within is the work of Kundalini.

129
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,960
So  Raja Rajeshwari

130
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,520
is that power of Kundalini which establishes within you.

131
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,600
The essence of Lakshmi-pati is Raja Rajeshwari.

132
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,600
It doesn’t mean that you should get lots of money,

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,999
but should become generous, as if you are a king.

134
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,800
Raja Rajeshwari means that you develop the temperament of a king.

135
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,400
Here even the kings are like beggars,

136
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,840
and they are miserly,

137
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,680
they are liars, they take bribes, and do all such things.

138
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
But here we are talking about the pure form.

139
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,960
The one who worships Raj Rajeshwari,

140
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,840
and the one who has achieves it,

141
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
has so many qualities

142
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,999
that they maybe cannot be described in today's lecture.

143
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,960
But the biggest thing which happens

144
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:35,999
is that one develops generosity,

145
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,640
he becomes generous,

146
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,240
knowing that he is nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

147
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,999
"I will never have any shortage of money or anything else.

148
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,240
So why not just enjoy!

149
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,240
Why not make myself happy by giving to others?"

150
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,880
In olden times, when kings were pleased,

151
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,999
then they would give the most precious things to those near them.

152
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,520
The man who does not have generosity,

153
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
his (life's) meaning is incomplete.

154
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,920
The most important thing is that

155
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:40,400
no king begs in front of anyone, ever!

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,840
He might get poor,

157
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
and maybe even his entire property is lost,

158
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,800
but he will not go and beg in front of anyone.

159
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
He might die, but he will not beg.

160
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,640
So Sahaja Yogis develop a temperament of a king.

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Even their lifestyle is king's like.

162
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,999
He does not go about wearing torn clothes,

163
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,999
like these people from Hare Rama.

164
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,999
They take the name of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna,

165
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,999
and Krishna is Himself Kubera,

166
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,999
but as people of His kingdom, they roam about like beggars.

167
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,880
By no means they know the essence of Krishna.

168
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,040
But Sahaja Yogis should know

169
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,960
that according to your temperament,

170
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,080
Paramchaitanya will create your situation.

171
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,999
A man who is always crying for money

172
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,999
will be in such a situation only -

173
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,999
a man who is always calculating the money

174
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,960
and who is always busy to make more money.

175
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:05,514
There are even people who want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,600
These people are completely gone cases!

177
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,853
No one is worse than them.

178
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,012
Once

179
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,520
King Akbar asked Birbal (his minister),

180
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,140
"Who are the most downtrodden people?"

181
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:34,999
So he said, "Those who beg from people in the temple of God".

182
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:39,859
When God is sitting here, why are you begging from people?

183
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,119
Similarly, there are such people also in Sahaja Yoga -

184
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,999
very few, but there are some -

185
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,345
who think that they have to make money somehow in Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:56,119
Someone told me that in Ganapatipule

187
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,333
Sahaja Yogis brought some things and were selling them.

188
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,879
There was one person who took My permission and sold things,

189
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,854
and whatever profit he had, he gave it to Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,815
But even this shouldn't be done.

191
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:17,879
But they say that it's convenient
for people to get sarees and so on.

192
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,949
But such a person who only wants to earn money in Sahaja Yoga,

193
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,100
is not worthy of being called Sahaja Yogi.

194
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:40,310
You cannot understand the power of Raja Rajeshwari through him.

195
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:46,577
With Raja Rajeshwari power, whether a man has money or not,

196
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:56,637
there is no fear in him.

197
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:05,689
There is no feeling of any shortage,

198
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,439
that, "I have a scarcity of this".

199
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
He feels, "I am totally complete. What else should I do?

200
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,305
What else do I need?

201
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:19,798
Why should I be scared?

202
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:25,160
Wherever I am, I will have prosperity.

203
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,545
I can achieve everything there."

204
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:32,049
And such a man

205
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:40,862
lives his life in a very majestical way.

206
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,086
His temperament is like

207
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:57,894
a very magnificent and great human being.

208
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:05,538
He enjoys only giving, not accepting.

209
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,752
If someone is rich, then he is rich only for himself,

210
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:15,610
and if someone is poor, then also he is poor only for himself.

211
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,243
But for a Sahaja Yogi, whether a person is rich or poor,

212
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:23,662
for him it's (not important),

213
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:30,376
he will be completely ready to help that person.

214
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,429
There are also such people in Sahaja Yoga

215
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,011
who do a lot for asahaj people,

216
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,664
but if some poor Sahaja Yogi come,

217
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:45,234
they don't even offer him a chair to sit on.

218
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,341
So by looking at the exterior grandeur (of people)

219
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,949
many people give them a lot of importance.

220
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:58,279
“He is very great", "he has so many cars",

221
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,999
or "he is a very famous actor",

222
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,240
or "a famous doctor", "architect", "a very great man”.

223
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,893
These titles are very outward things, and they are given importance.

224
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:18,692
But if someone thinks that,

225
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:23,999
“The power is flowing through this man,

226
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:30,633
such powerful vibrations are flowing through him.

227
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,543
Who is this great saint?"

228
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:40,902
Such a person possess a temperament like a king, we can say.

229
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:44,679
There are many such people in our country.

230
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,907
We have the special example of Shivaji Maharaj.

231
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,141
He was a great saint,

232
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,320
a realized soul and a very ideal person,

233
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,282
but his behavior towards saints

234
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:06,822
was extremely beautiful and polite.

235
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,639
Once his guru, Shri Ramdas arrived

236
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,805
and he called on Shivaji.

237
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:22,403
Shivaji Maharaj wrote a letter and put it in his bag.

238
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:26,839
In that letter it was written, "Guru, O my Guru,

239
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:33,680
All of my power, my kingdom

240
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,407
everything, I am giving to you."

241
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,666
After reading that letter,

242
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,960
Guru Ramdas laughed and said,

243
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,408
"Son, I am an ascetic.

244
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:53,869
What will I do with your kingdom?

245
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:59,796
You are the king, and this is your duty (to rule the kingdom).

246
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,793
But yes, if you think,

247
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:14,722
that you should rule this kingdom with bhakti,

248
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,798
then you can make its flag,

249
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:27,977
triangular and the same color as my robe.

250
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:35,584
With that flag, people will understand

251
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:39,571
that you are ruling with a saintly attitude.

252
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:45,196
You don’t have any attraction or attachment for it.

253
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,867
You are the king,

254
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:56,202
but still you do not have the consciousness of this fact."

255
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:02,422
Those people who are boasting that they are the king

256
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,760
and go about madly saying this,

257
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,999
that "I am this", actually they are not that.

258
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:12,739
And those who are, they never say so.

259
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:18,222
You will see many such people.

260
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,956
Once I was traveling in London.

261
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:28,279
There was a gentlemen sitting far who started talking to Me.

262
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,010
(Men) usually don’t talk to women, they talk amongst themselves.

263
00:22:35,943 --> 00:22:39,759
But he asked a lot about India.

264
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,098
"How is this? How is that?"

265
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:46,640
So I asked, "Did you go to India?"

266
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:50,070
He said, "Yes, I was in India for many years."

267
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,950
And he did not say anything about himself, who he was.

268
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:01,571
Then he disembarked and left and I also left.

269
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,119
Later, one day,

270
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,124
I was traveling with My husband and we met him again in the train.

271
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:16,319
So he invited us to his house

272
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,960
to discuss about India.

273
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:26,560
So when we reached, we found that he had a very big house.

274
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:30,024
We found out he was the Viceroy in India!

275
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,120
But he never said it himself!

276
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,798
We didn’t even know that he was the Viceroy.

277
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,685
In earlier times, people could not even meet the Viceroy.

278
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,600
And he talked to us with so much humility,

279
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:47,385
"If you have any problem, let me know".

280
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,523
Being a lady, I was thinking,

281
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:51,955
"Why is he giving Me so much importance?"

282
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,742
"Are You having any problem?

283
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:56,840
People here are a bit stubborn", all these kind of talks!

284
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,124
"They are not like Indians. They are not dharmic."

285
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:04,361
All these kind of talks. But he never said that he was a Viceroy!

286
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:08,280
And he had so much respect for Indians.

287
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,839
He was talking about them with so much love.

288
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,063
In our country,

289
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:19,749
if someone is a minister's assistant, even that makes him crazy.

290
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:24,459
There is a story that when some people went to meet the minister,

291
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,639
there was a man who was shouting a lot.

292
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,202
So they asked, "Why are you so angry?"

293
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:33,208
He said, "Don’t you know? I am the P.A. (drunk in Hindi)".

294
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:39,719
If people get even a little bit,

295
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,277
their minds get damaged,

296
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:45,798
and this is not a symptom of a king.

297
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:52,058
The first quality of a king is that he is extremely polite.

298
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,480
Arrogance comes in a man because he thinks,

299
00:24:56,681 --> 00:25:01,058
"I am so wealthy. I can scold everyone, shout at everyone".

300
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:09,660
Or if he is highly educated, has a high position,

301
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:13,692
or is the son of an important father, he gets more arrogant.

302
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,787
You can't even talk to him!

303
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:23,194
I have noticed

304
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:26,662
that even common men -

305
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:32,999
like in My husband's office, they would answer rudely on the phone.

306
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,999
So once he asked, "Who is speaking?" and he found it was Me.

307
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,879
He was very scared!

308
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,320
"In the beginning why did you talk so rudely?"

309
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,999
He said, "Don’t tell Sir about it. Please forgive me!"

310
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,319
I said, "Why would I tell him?

311
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,759
But why did you talk like this in the beginning?"

312
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,931
Water always spills out from a vessel which is half full.

313
00:25:54,132 --> 00:26:01,263
The person who is complete is extremely polite and simple.

314
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:04,840
You will understand that.

315
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,920
Until you are complete, you will have a false ego,

316
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:13,592
false anger,

317
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,759
and you acquire a strange type of personality,

318
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,373
so that anyone who hears your name runs away!

319
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:26,093
One type are like beggars.

320
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:30,759
When they come, you know they have come to ask for something.

321
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,876
"This has happened to me, my father, my mother.

322
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,616
I don’t have money. I want this". Always like a beggar!

323
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:43,470
And another type are always shouting.

324
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,158
So first we have to become Vaishnav, to come to the center.

325
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:54,758
You can gain the power of Raja Rajeshwari only coming to the center.

326
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:57,999
Otherwise it will not work within you!

327
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
Like there is no point in watering a plastic plant.

328
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,835
Similarly, in these people

329
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:15,384
there is a kind of false show.

330
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:23,442
Recently I was coming from London. There was a lady with Me.

331
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:31,086
She was wearing many diamonds, in her ears, nose, hands, everywhere.

332
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:36,012
So she said,

333
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,559
"I believe in simple living and high thinking.

334
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,796
Live with simplicity and have high thoughts."

335
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:46,239
So I said, "Good, very good. Have a seat, please".

336
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,019
She said, "I don’t wear this kind of colored clothes.

337
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,612
So, I am very simple." I said, "Very good!"

338
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,892
Before arriving to India,

339
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:00,562
she came to Me, "I have a problem. Please help me out.

340
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,199
The customs officers respect you a lot,

341
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,879
and I am wearing 650,0000 Rupees worth of jewelries,

342
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,720
so please take me through customs."

343
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,449
So I said, "You believe in simple living.

344
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,760
So why don't you tell customs that you believe in simple living?

345
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,172
They will release you, just like that!"

346
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,359
She came behind Me, and the customs people

347
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,496
did namaskar to Me and also to her, and she passed through.

348
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,095
Another thing in a man is greed.

349
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:41,724
Greed is a very dirty and bad thing.

350
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,953
Very low people have greed for others' things.

351
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,439
As soon as they come from someone's house they start,

352
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,359
"Let's also get the thing which was in their house".

353
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,901
Bring this thing, then another thing. There is no end to that!

354
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:03,082
And greed continues.

355
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,505
What is the antidote to this greed?

356
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:18,631
The antidote is to know what a headache is to own something.

357
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:27,599
For example, here is a nice carpet,

358
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,408
and I start having greed for it,

359
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,760
"I want to get this carpet".

360
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,554
I can even steal it,

361
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,882
and if I don't steel it, then all the time the thoughts will be,

362
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,990
"Where did this carpet come from? When?" and so on.

363
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:47,461
So Puja is on one side,

364
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,054
and if that carpet is brought and it's laid down here, you'll think,

365
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:57,705
"Oh, this carpet will be spoilt. This will happen to it" and so on.

366
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,802
It's better if you understand that this is not your carpet.

367
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,798
"It belongs to someone else. God save me!"

368
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,239
That’s all. No more trouble!

369
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,407
"If it belongs to someone else, then why should I have the headache,

370
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:16,682
get it insured, do this, go to the bank.

371
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:20,048
Why should I do it? It doesn’t belong to Me.

372
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,591
Leave it. Do you want to take it? Take it!

373
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:26,487
Do you want more? There is more. Very good!"

374
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:35,639
This way, the madness of greed

375
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:39,962
is completely destroyed.

376
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:45,596
And it's a very big problem for Sahaja Yogis

377
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:49,439
because on one side they are Sahaja Yogis, and on the other side

378
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,040
their foot is in the mouth of a crocodile called greed.

379
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:58,225
So how will they come into the boat? Their foot is stuck there.

380
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,519
If we have greed for anything

381
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,754
then we must realize that Raja Rajeshwari has left us.

382
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:12,798
And those who have a temperament of Raj Rajeshwari

383
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:16,999
start enjoying even small things!

384
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,427
They never have a shortage of anything.

385
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:34,360
Once I went to Palitana. It's a two and a half hour climb journey.

386
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:40,200
There, outside, was a temple made of sangamarmar,

387
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:43,800
what we call as marble.

388
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:48,228
So all those people who were with Me, laid down.

389
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:50,588
When I saw what was above, I said, "Look up.

390
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,209
So many elephants carved

391
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,617
and they all have their tails made in a different way."

392
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,385
They said, "Mummy, we are so tired.

393
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:02,631
How can You see tails of elephants?"

394
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:04,963
I said, "See there. You are not looking at them".

395
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:06,760
They said, "Aren't You tired?"

396
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:11,362
I said, "No, after seeing this art, all My tiredness ran away!"

397
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,259
So we start to enjoy small, small things

398
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:25,078
start to enjoy them and feel the satisfaction.

399
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:30,533
Like, Shri Ram was so satisfied after eating the berries of Shabri.

400
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,884
When you start to understand this thing, then you can say

401
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:44,508
that you are nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

402
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:50,672
If someone gives a small thing with love,

403
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:56,040
even a small thing like a betel nut given with love,

404
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,719
even if I don’t eat betel nut usually, that one I will surely eat,

405
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:05,798
to make that other person happy.

406
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,214
He doesn’t know that I don’t eat betel nut.

407
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,073
It means that for any object in this world,

408
00:33:18,274 --> 00:33:23,999
if you put on, for example on the glass,

409
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:29,298
if you put mercury,

410
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:36,719
any ordinary glass which is transparent, if you put mercury,

411
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,505
then it becomes a mirror in which you can see your reflection.

412
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:45,018
On any object, if you add love

413
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,938
that object becomes so beautiful.

414
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,666
Then you want to give it to someone.

415
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,040
Like when you go to the market, you will feel that,

416
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,439
"Yes, this is good for him, this is good for her".

417
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,671
What is good for yourself, this thought shouldn’t even come.

418
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:16,480
If this thought comes, "What do I want? What do I like?", finished!

419
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:23,798
It means that the All-pervading Power has not yet come within you.

420
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:28,388
If the All-pervading Power comes within you,

421
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,798
then you will become very wise

422
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,999
and will know what is the need of everybody.

423
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:44,872
Like if you go somewhere and you see

424
00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:50,737
that there is a very beautiful lamp,

425
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:54,439
you think, "Yes, I stayed in their house

426
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,133
and they didn’t have this lamp. So I should get it for them."

427
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,719
You start to understand everyone’s needs,

428
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,808
when your own needs disappear.

429
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:12,839
You remember everyone's problems.

430
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,594
Someone is sick,

431
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:18,798
someone needs something,

432
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:23,878
someone doesn’t have a tape recorder

433
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,459
and he wants to hear My speech,

434
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,760
all this you know.

435
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,009
And when you give him that thing,

436
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,798
he says, "Mother, how did you find out that I need it?"

437
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,602
What do you mean? I don’t know how.

438
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:41,174
That's why love is called knowledge.

439
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:44,614
Knowledge is only pure love,

440
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:48,546
because when you have pure love for anybody,

441
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:52,701
then you have all the knowledge about him, and it happens.

442
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,191
Even if She is Mahamaya, you can know,

443
00:35:57,392 --> 00:36:00,330
but you must have pure love.

444
00:36:01,102 --> 00:36:05,453
The pure love gives you all the knowledge -

445
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,808
any kind of knowledge, any type.

446
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,798
For example, if you look with pure love to something -

447
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:22,999
like in Madras I have seen a lot of poverty and suffering.

448
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,798
So the thought arose in my mind

449
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:32,260
that in this heat there are small small children, old people,

450
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,164
everyone standing and waiting for the bus for a long time

451
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:40,079
and I am sitting in a nice car moving around.

452
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,951
So I started worrying.

453
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,839
"What should I do about it?"

454
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,068
I said, "Why don’t they arrange a private transport?

455
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:51,292
At least some of their misery will be lessened."

456
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:53,992
And this is what is staying in My mind,

457
00:36:54,193 --> 00:36:58,222
that somehow this transport should be organized.

458
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:01,840
So when you get Realization,

459
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,523
then you are bound by the brotherhood of the entire world.

460
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,798
It's such a great work of Shri Raja Rajeshwari,

461
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,168
that you can think about everybody!

462
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,676
Like the queen of a king

463
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:19,563
will look at the problems of her people

464
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:22,040
and will remove their problems.

465
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:25,557
She will not sit down counting how many jewelries she has,

466
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:28,798
how many diamonds she has.

467
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,719
She will see,

468
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,399
"How many people in my kingdom are suffering?

469
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,178
What small things even do they need?"

470
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,798
Similarly, your temperament also becomes like this.

471
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:48,644
Until you raise to a higher state,

472
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:54,488
how can you be a worshipper of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma?

473
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,679
And Vishwa Nirmal Dharma is not something outward,

474
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,917
like, "I am Hindu, or Muslim or Christian." It's not like this.

475
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:07,079
This is an internal light,

476
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,254
and in this light a human being

477
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:14,194
comes out with a very majestic personality.

478
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,513
He doesn’t think,

479
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:23,335
"What am I getting? What have I achieved?"

480
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:31,439
He only thinks, "What can I do for others?

481
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,520
I have done very less.

482
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,696
Oh Mother! I could give Realization to only 100 people.

483
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,679
I couldn’t do anything more!"

484
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,585
When one starts thinking like this, then he must understand

485
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:50,448
that the power of Raja Rajeshwari is overflowing within him.

486
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:53,627
It's shining. It's troubling him that,

487
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,790
"What are you doing? You have so much power.

488
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,653
Why are you not giving it to others?"

489
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,399
This cannot be measured by money or anything else.

490
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,367
Like today I was late.

491
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:11,123
There was a phone call from Russia so I was delayed.

492
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:16,479
So on the way I asked, "Where is everyone sitting?"

493
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:18,616
They said, "In the open."

494
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:22,715
So I said, "Did you put up some shade for them?" They didn’t know.

495
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:26,208
They said, "Mother, may not be a roof, but cool breeze is blowing!"

496
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,999
I said, "But a roof should be there.

497
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,999
I won't like to have a roof only above Me and not above others."

498
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,866
So they said, "It's like this, with roof only above You."

499
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,490
"This is not correct".

500
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:41,279
Finally when I saw they all had a roof above them, I was very happy.

501
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:52,023
Similarly, in Chinddwara also it was very hot

502
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,277
and everyone was sitting in the open.

503
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,959
All the time I was worried about what was happening,

504
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,999
and everyone was saying, "Mother, we were feeling cold from inside".

505
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,439
Although they were sitting in so much heat, they were feeling cold!

506
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,159
This power of Raja Rajeshwari

507
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,719
is benevolent for everyone, everywhere.

508
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,759
It is much more than benevolence, it gives everyone rest,

509
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,012
it gives everyone happiness and joy.

510
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:22,798
And the same power you have within yourself.

511
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:28,960
If you want, you can take it to a very high level.

512
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,879
The work which can be accomplished with just one paisa

513
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,756
cannot be accomplished with 1000 rupees.

514
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:43,798
But the power of giving should be great.

515
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:47,119
I will say again that

516
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,628
Shri Krishna went to Vidura's house and ate with him,

517
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:52,920
and didn’t eat the delicacies of Duryodhana.

518
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:55,759
There is a very important message

519
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,132
and the message is that, if something is filled with love,

520
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,715
you cannot measure its worth.

521
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:13,433
So firstly, Vaishnavas need

522
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,044
to clean their Lakshmi chakra.

523
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:23,547
"First of all I don’t have any needs.

524
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:28,144
Others have needs, and that's why I have come to Sahaja Yoga."

525
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:31,159
You should come with such thoughts.

526
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,199
You will be surprised that yesterday,

527
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,379
so many people came after the program, and I was very happy.

528
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,547
But suddenly, My right heart was caught up.

529
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,502
I didn’t understand why right heart catches so much here.

530
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,010
It has never happened before.

531
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:54,004
Then this power gave some indication.

532
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:59,480
Then I asked, "What is the position of Gruha Lakshmis here?

533
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,840
How do people treat Gruha Lakshmis in Hyderabad?"

534
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,200
So I found out that they treat them very badly.

535
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,315
There is no respect for them at all,

536
00:42:11,516 --> 00:42:14,159
and they are scolding them all the time.

537
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,719
They respect their mother but don’t respect their wife at all.

538
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,583
And they said, "This is the Muslim influence here".

539
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:26,486
You don’t know, even Muslims

540
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,798
how much they talked about respecting the women in Koran,

541
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:32,608
but they don’t do it. It's a stupidity!

542
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,142
Respect for women is written there (in Koran) but is nowhere else.

543
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:41,798
Then I understood.

544
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:47,279
Where women are worshipped, there reside the Devtas.

545
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,999
Where the women of the house

546
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:54,798
are not respected,

547
00:42:54,999 --> 00:42:58,954
there the Devtas never rule.

548
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:06,962
Of course, the simple idea is that

549
00:43:07,163 --> 00:43:14,980
if you respect you wife completely,

550
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:18,270
then children will also respect you and respect themselves.

551
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,645
This is true.

552
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,890
But if the woman herself is not worthy of being worshipped,

553
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:29,631
and she does such things which are not worthy of being worshipped,

554
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:34,431
then she must be corrected.

555
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,916
But if she is a good woman,

556
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,599
and she takes care of the children of the house

557
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,357
and takes care of the household with love,

558
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:49,757
this kind of a woman

559
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:53,230
should be respected, not only in the house but also in the society.

560
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,559
But think about that My entire right heart got caught up,

561
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,319
and for half an hour I was suffering.

562
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,999
All the suffering which you give to your wives,

563
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,261
all that suffering came inside Me!

564
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,798
Now, it's possible

565
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:15,103
that a woman may not understand Sahaja Yoga very well with her mind,

566
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:17,618
but with her heart she understands.

567
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,693
A woman understands things with her heart,

568
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:23,971
and a man understands with his mind.

569
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,206
But it's a very big thing to understand with one's heart,

570
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:31,999
and women are always considered as a form of Shakti.

571
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,519
In a house where a woman is not respected,

572
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,055
nothing will work out properly.

573
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:41,079
The reason is, if woman only is the power -

574
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,903
for example, if this does not have power,

575
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,759
then what is the use of My talking?

576
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,639
This big thing is kept here,

577
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,840
but it's of no use if it does not have electricity.

578
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,400
If you suppress the woman of the house like this,

579
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:57,839
and she is not respected,

580
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,133
the power cannot work within you.

581
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,798
This is a very big fault.

582
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,359
I don't know why, it never happened before

583
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,490
but yesterday, after the program,

584
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,103
the entire right heart was caught up so badly.

585
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:17,867
I used to think that these things happen more in North India,

586
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:19,744
but I see they are more in South India.

587
00:45:19,945 --> 00:45:23,088
North Indians don’t do it so much.

588
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:28,370
If Indians have a shortcoming, it's only this one,

589
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:31,798
that they don’t give respect for the women's power.

590
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:35,760
The biggest shortcoming! On one side they will worship the Goddess,

591
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,091
will recognize Her as innocent Goddess,

592
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:42,595
will recognize Her in all Her forms, but not as Gruha Lakshmi.

593
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:48,229
That’s why today I want to say clearly that if you are Sahaja Yogis,

594
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,991
then keep your respect towards your women.

595
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:55,679
I have heard that openly you are scolding them.

596
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,080
Then openly you will also be insulted.

597
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,347
A man has no right to insult a woman,

598
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:07,250
for no reason.

599
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:15,015
I think that if this thing can get right,

600
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,999
then the powers of  Raja Rajeshwari will be definitely activated.

601
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:25,239
You should understand completely

602
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,652
that husband and wife are the two wheels of a chariot,

603
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:33,842
one on the left, and the other on the right.

604
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:36,726
Left one cannot come to the right, right cannot come to the left.

605
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,443
Both have to keep their place.

606
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:44,410
Both of them are similar but their places are different.

607
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:47,270
It means no place is higher or lower.

608
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,965
If one wheel gets lower, the chariot will not move forward.

609
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,549
It will keep rotating in one place.

610
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:59,106
Children also learn these things from you.

611
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:02,798
If children cannot respect their mother,

612
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:06,805
what can they do then in this world? How can they respect Me?

613
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:12,632
That’s why I have a request from everybody,

614
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:17,079
that from today don’t insult anymore the women in your house.

615
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,052
Don't make them look smaller in any way.

616
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:22,639
Their power is very important for you.

617
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,279
Similarly, women should also go deeper in Sahaj

618
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,545
and should assume their powers,

619
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,611
should achieve their powers.

620
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,839
Today, so many people have come for the Puja.

621
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,735
They have come from the whole of India.

622
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,719
I did not expect that.

623
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,028
Now Sahaja Yoga is indeed getting very integrated

624
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:57,393
and things are happening with so much love.

625
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:02,693
Everywhere, wherever I look,

626
00:48:02,894 --> 00:48:09,025
it looks like Sahaja Yoga is spreading with great speed.

627
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:17,698
But we must understand one thing,

628
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:21,301
how deep we have gone.

629
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,058
It is very important.

630
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,839
The number is increasing,

631
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,139
but there is no advantage in a big quantity.

632
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,920
Until the time

633
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,006
the values of Sahaja Yoga come within you,

634
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,501
the quality will not be achieved.

635
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:53,522
If you respect Raja Rajeshwari,

636
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,499
then Her powers increase within you.

637
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,680
Its manifestation should be within you.

638
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,239
If not, then it's all right also.

639
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,702
You have taken off one robe and put on another one.

640
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:07,671
It's all outward thing.

641
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:09,896
Nothing happened inside.

642
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:15,497
This is an innate power and it should be visible

643
00:49:15,698 --> 00:49:19,255
in your behavior, conversation, everything.

644
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,652
Unlimited blessings to you all.
