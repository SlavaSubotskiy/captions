1
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:19,458
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

2
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,208
of a different level.

3
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,083
We've been talking all the time

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,834
about the mundane things

5
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,500
and these things sometimes are very ...

6
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,709
are of so much importance, we think.

7
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,458
But when I talked to you yesterday,

8
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,709
I hope you all realized

9
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,000
that we have to now jump into

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,000
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,208
First we are worried about

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,583
our families, our children,

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,959
our households;

14
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,375
then, our marriages.

15
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,083
One after another all these questions came up,

16
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:28,959
and we were concerned about all these things;

17
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,709
little, little things.

18
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,083
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

19
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,625
which we were running:

20
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,709
the problems of the ashram,

21
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,333
what we have been doing,

22
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:46,125
how we have been facing the problems,

23
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,583
how people are creating problems.

24
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,959
That's how our humanity started

25
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:58,125
acquiring a subtler understanding.

26
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,709
And then we also realized that

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,792
we are blessed by God,

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,917
that there's something great

29
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,333
that is always looking after us,

30
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,500
some higher Force,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,917
some special Attention is there about us.

32
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,583
This is what we realized.

33
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:30,125
Today I was explaining how it happens,

34
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:37,333
that how we realize

35
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,583
that God is helping us too.

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,542
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

37
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,041
- every problem.

38
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,417
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

39
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,792
in a motorway

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,208
and the car went out of control,

41
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,041
and the brake would not act.

42
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,834
And there was a car coming from the right,

43
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,417
car coming from the left,

44
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:17,375
cars going through in front and behind.

45
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:20,875
And she felt that they'll be finished

46
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,166
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

47
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:32,375
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

48
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,999
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,041
So now, how to overcome that problem?

50
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,500
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,375
because cause is still there.

52
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,625
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

53
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,667
Then what to do?

54
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,875
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

55
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:04,417
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,500
so the cause does not exist for you,

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,667
so the effect does not exist for you.

58
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,250
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,375
the effect will be there.

60
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,500
So what did she do?

61
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,458
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

62
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:24,375
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

63
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:29,709
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,917
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

65
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:42,458
So you must ascend away from the cause.

66
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,458
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

67
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,917
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

68
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:54,834
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

69
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,917
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

70
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,083
- is such and such person.

71
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,667
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

72
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,583
Surrender it.

73
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,250
You are, you have the right to do that.

74
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,208
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

75
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,583
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,333
- but you don't do it, you forget.

77
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,667
You just forget.

78
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:27,542
If you surrender that cause,

79
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,709
the effects will go away.

80
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,375
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,959
that you have to ascend.

82
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:42,583
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

83
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,083
So I've been playing with you.

84
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,500
You had causes to say,

85
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,709
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

86
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,125
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

87
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,000
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

88
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,375
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

89
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,500
- and that and that, and this is that.

90
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,000
Then, "I am like that.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,917
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

92
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,834
So the bhoot is the cause.

93
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,500
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

94
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:17,125
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

95
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,959
So first you go beyond that, saying,

96
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,000
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

97
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,792
I know my Mother.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,834
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

99
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,041
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,125
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

101
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,500
When you are in emergent condition,

102
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,625
then it works out faster.

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,333
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

104
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,792
like Mona's condition.

105
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,083
There was another case where a

106
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,917
journalist was traveling from ...

107
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,792
or something and his brakes broke down,

108
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,667
and he was with another journalist,

109
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,750
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

110
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,917
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

111
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,208
So he found his brakes are not working

112
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:26,542
and he found his car is going,

113
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,875
in front there is a big truck coming up

114
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,083
and another truck coming from behind.

115
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,667
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

116
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,458
and his brakes were horrid.

117
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,875
That was a emergency, you see.

118
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,166
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

119
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,792
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

120
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,166
Now we're finished."

121
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,917
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

122
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,417
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

123
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:56,542
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

124
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:01,667
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

125
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,417
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

126
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,333
But that emergency has to come.

127
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,625
Human beings are such that unless and until

128
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,792
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

129
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,875
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

130
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,542
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

131
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,999
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

132
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:34,083
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

133
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,667
so that you think of God.

134
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,792
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

135
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,208
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

136
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,834
so that they can get out of it.

137
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,834
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

138
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:01,750
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

139
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,125
Only way is meditation.

140
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,834
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

141
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,959
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

142
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,125
You may be all right for a while

143
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,875
for two, three months, maybe two years,

144
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,583
but then you drop out.

145
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,291
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

146
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,750
You see, it's all right.

147
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,959
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

148
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,625
Because in meditation only you grow.

149
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,959
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

150
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,500
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,834
You just come up with a spring.

152
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,834
But if you have to have continuous growth

153
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,959
then you must meditate,

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,417
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

155
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,417
and then allow them to subside,

156
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,375
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

157
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:05,709
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

158
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,000
And you grow in your detachment

159
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,625
to the cause of all the effects.

160
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,417
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

161
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,750
But this is the problem with us,

162
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,834
is that we do not meditate, normally.

163
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,000
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,999
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

165
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,875
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

166
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,834
but you don't grow.

167
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,250
Growth can only come if you meditate.

168
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,250
That is one very important part,

169
00:10:52,583 --> 00:11:00,959
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,709
In the normal life, how do we grow?

171
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,500
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

172
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,041
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

173
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,875
we have to have sufficient food,

174
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,834
we have to have all these things.

175
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,375
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

176
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,875
There's no way out.

177
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,250
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

178
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,125
actually bumptious people,

179
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,166
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

180
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,709
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,125
They can give big lectures, this, that,

182
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,834
but have no vibrations at all.

183
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,834
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,000
they are not collective,

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,375
they have no sense to be collective,

186
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,999
all kinds of problems.

187
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:51,709
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.

188
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,041
That is one part of it.

189
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,041
That is, we can say, is the worship, is the puja.

190
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,375
Then you don't have to give up anything,

191
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,166
you just become detached,

192
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,834
detached from the cause itself.

193
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,875
That's one part of it.

194
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,542
Secondly, that this I would say will

195
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:24,625
take you to the subtler side of your emotional bindings,

196
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,291
because emotional binding has given you

197
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,750
certain identification:

198
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,125
you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim,

199
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,834
or this and that, or a British or any kind of a race,

200
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,999
or whatever you have to call it.

201
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,250
All those things will drop out,

202
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,125
because you get a detached personality.

203
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,999
So these emotional bindings - "he is my brother,"

204
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,625
"she is my sister," "I am worried about my wife,"

205
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,542
"I am worried about my child"

206
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,875
- all these emotional bindings which

207
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:02,709
make you a smaller personality will drop out,

208
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,625
and you'll have one emotional binding,

209
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:09,500
is that "I am growing in my compassion.

210
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,875
Compassion is active, my compassion is effective.

211
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,750
My compassion is alight.

212
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,834
My compassion is this discretion.

213
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,417
I am a yogi."

214
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,875
And secondly you read about Sahaja Yoga,

215
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,999
you know about Sahaja Yoga,

216
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,834
you know the technique of Sahaja yoga,

217
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,542
you raise your kundalini,

218
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,583
you clean your chakras,

219
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,375
try to understand about mantras.

220
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,750
You master your mantras,

221
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,834
you master your deities,

222
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
you please them.

223
00:13:56,542 --> 00:14:00,375
All these things when they are done properly,

224
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,291
then your mental bindings will drop out.

225
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,291
Those who think they are great scientists,

226
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,709
they will know that all this is no science;

227
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,417
the science of God's technique is much more.

228
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,667
Those who think that they are over-read,

229
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,083
well-read people, when they read about Sahaja Yoga

230
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,083
and work it out on themselves and see for themselves,

231
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,959
and on others,

232
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,125
they will know that whatever they have read is all stupid,

233
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,500
has no meaning, is empty.

234
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,208
And that's how a kind of an emptiness will come in,

235
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,709
emptiness of ego,

236
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,083
because they'll see that knowledge is so great.

237
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,834
Like Newton said that "Knowledge is like an ocean,

238
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,834
and I am like a little child

239
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,458
collecting some pebbles at its shore."

240
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,917
What an understanding!

241
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,208
So that emptiness comes in you,

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,125
and then the real knowledge starts coming into you.

243
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,458
The identification with real knowledge comes.

244
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,959
You talk;

245
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,083
when you talk, that talk has an effect - that's a mantra.

246
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,375
You just don't jabber,

247
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,959
"Oh, I am in Sahaja Yoga.

248
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,208
I have been in Sahaja Yoga for fifteen years"

249
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,125
- good for nothing.

250
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,333
You may be there

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,667
for a hundred years but you may remain a donkey as donkey is,

252
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,458
absolutely.

253
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,583
But you may have been there only for one year,

254
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,125
and you may become from a donkey a human being,

255
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,917
and a yogi too.

256
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,250
But that is what we have to first of all

257
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,500
recondition ourselves,

258
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:55,458
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

259
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,333
I mean, you have an advantage

260
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,583
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

261
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,792
they had nothing to look forward.

262
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:10,208
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

263
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,709
but they had no Form.

264
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,375
You have a Form.

265
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,083
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

266
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:23,667
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

267
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,000
in the air, do you see;

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,250
absolute consciousness,

269
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,333
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

270
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,959
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

271
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,041
that you have to give Me anything.

272
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,333
What do you give Me?

273
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,041
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

274
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,500
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

275
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
You also say that "It works out, Mother,

276
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,999
somehow it worked out."

277
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,625
What is bandhan?

278
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,875
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

279
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,041
you're just telephoning to Her.

280
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,667
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

281
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,208
that's all.

282
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,291
You know I also play with you, I also say,

283
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,750
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

284
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,291
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

285
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,959
It's a telephone call,

286
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,834
just a telephone call.

287
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,542
But the faith has developed now that yes,

288
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,542
this is the real faith,

289
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,166
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

290
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,375
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan,

291
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,667
finished. "My father" - give him a bandhan.

292
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,792
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

293
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,333
whatever it is.

294
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,041
Bandhan, whatever it is.

295
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,959
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

296
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,458
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

297
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,667
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

298
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,291
which is flowing through your hands.

299
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,667
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

300
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,458
You've got it,

301
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,333
it is flowing through you.

302
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,250
But what about your love for your Mother?

303
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,834
And that is what I find,

304
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,583
that at the time when there is complete emergency

305
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:16,250
that surrender comes in, and it works.

306
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,667
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

307
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:26,125
You must slow and steadily work it out,

308
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:31,000
and it will build up by itself within you.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,792
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

310
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,667
But meditation is one way;

311
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,792
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,125
Not showing off, not telling others,

313
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,000
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

314
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,250
how they work out,

315
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,917
on yourself, not on others.

316
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,250
Once you start teaching others, it's a bhoot in you.

317
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,709
You'd better learn it for yourself, even within yourself.

318
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,542
I know who has mastered which chakra, which ....

319
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,458
Nobody tell others that

320
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:06,208
"this is the way to do it," that's absolute nonsensical ego.

321
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,333
So such things should not be done.

322
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,917
If somebody asks you, you can tell

323
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:19,208
individually, but on a large scale you do not give lectures

324
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,542
on that, and don't confuse people.

325
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,542
Now, so we have two things,

326
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,834
that we have to get over our emotional

327
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:34,250
grossness and our mental grossness;

328
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,333
same with our physical grossness.

329
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,917
Physical grossness can be overcome

330
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,125
if you surrender yourself,

331
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:52,000
to one medicine, is vibrations.

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,250
Like Anupama, My grandchild, told her mother,

333
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,208
"You are born in allopathy,

334
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,333
then you are following homeopathy.

335
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,709
Tomorrow you'll find out some jumbopathy,

336
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,999
then some numbopathy!

337
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:09,667
So, but I am born in God

338
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,333
and I follow only God's pathy,

339
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,208
and God will look after me

340
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,542
and God will cure me."

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So My daughter said, "Why? You may also change."

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,542
She said, "Why?

343
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,125
Because God never changes."

344
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:29,834
Simple answer: God will cure you.

345
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:36,709
But you must have that much ascent to say that,

346
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:40,083
as you just jump out at the time of emergency.

347
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,083
Same sort of an urge,

348
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,250
that same sort of a personality should be within you

349
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,667
to say that. Just if you say,

350
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,542
"Oh God, please save me,"

351
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,917
God has no time for such people.

352
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,709
You have no time for God, God has no time for you either

353
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,709
- a simple thing.

354
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,917
So from sublime to mundane things when we come,

355
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,125
we exist in both the things

356
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,834
and we are effective.

357
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:12,834
Whether we are in the lamp or in the light or in the oil,

358
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,083
we are at a subtler point;

359
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,542
and we,

360
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,333
if we give the effectiveness

361
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,250
without being the cause.

362
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,208
Because you are beyond the cause,

363
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,375
so there is no need to create any cause for anything,

364
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,000
but you see the effect.

365
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,250
So once the cause is finished effect is achieved,

366
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,917
and it's achieved what is to be achieved,

367
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,208
the correctness of it.

368
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,917
The correct thing you get.

369
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,834
You do not get perverse thing,

370
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,000
but if you go with a cause then you can have perversity,

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,125
you can have all kinds of problems.

372
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,125
So the best thing is to detach yourself from causes

373
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,959
and then you get the effect,

374
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:04,000
like as I told you that the brake got all right.

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,166
The effect was there,

376
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,625
the car was all right,

377
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,291
everything was fine so the effect was all right;

378
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,041
but the cause was lost.

379
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,166
There was no cause.

380
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,917
Why? How?

381
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,959
How the thing was perfected?

382
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,291
If you ask the effect of it, you say how did you get it?

383
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,166
You can't explain, it didn't work out.

384
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,417
So because the cause is missing

385
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,083
you cannot put it to any cause;

386
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,291
you sometimes say it's divine the way it's worked out.

387
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:41,999
So the only cause that is really effective is divinity.

388
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,458
But the divinity should not be just as

389
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,000
a mundane sort of a thing,

390
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,792
"All right, yes, Mother's photograph is there, namaste.

391
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,458
Good. Namaste. Good morning, Mother" - finished.

392
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,875
That's not the way.

393
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,083
You have to know your Mother,

394
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,083
and you have to love your Mother

395
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,208
- that is what it is.

396
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,125
It's very embarrassing to say that you must love Me.

397
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:17,000
But as a Mother in this lifetime

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,999
I have had many embarrassing things,

399
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,458
and one of them is this,

400
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,999
that I don't know how to tell the children.

401
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,417
Now this is the fact.

402
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,999
So you need not go through any emergencies

403
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,458
or any such problems.

404
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,999
You just develop yourself in such a way

405
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:39,083
that you are so developed that it just acts and works out.

406
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:51,333
So I'll give you a example of that.

407
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,083
It works the least in England,

408
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,458
surprisingly, where I've worked the most

409
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,458
- least in England.

410
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,458
I'll give you a simple example, now.

411
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,667
You see, your coming to India was decided

412
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,291
I don't know how many months back.

413
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:08,999
I have been to India once and I'm going second time,

414
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,750
and England is the only place

415
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,750
where you have to pay your money directly.

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,792
People have not yet paid,

417
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,750
but Australians have done it.

418
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,667
Australians, who are eighty, eighty-five people have done it,

419
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,333
but English have not done - everything they are slow.

420
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,917
But when it comes to ego they are the first,

421
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,667
their flags are the first.

422
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:33,999
In the ego, where is it generated? - in England the great.

423
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,417
So when it comes to doing something they are the slowest,

424
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:41,667
when it comes to criticism they are the highest,

425
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,041
and then when it comes to the ego suddenly you'll see,

426
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,709
give them any position,

427
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,625
it's ....

428
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:54,417
Why? Again you can explain, because there is a cause.

429
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,417
You'll say it is inertia,

430
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,500
blame someone, or it's a bhoot,

431
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,750
or it's my ego or my superego, it's not myself.

432
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,500
Myself, I am all right.

433
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,542
Some cause.

434
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,542
Why you have not paid so far?

435
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:14,959
It's such a problem;

436
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,625
I have to go now.

437
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,959
If you were not coming you should not have come,

438
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,625
but if you are paying, you better pay for it.

439
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,667
Now, what's the matter with you?

440
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,083
They started with fifty people,

441
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,083
now they end up with thirty-five.

442
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,375
We have arranged for it,

443
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,625
we have ordered for things and

444
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,750
we have got the buses and all that;

445
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,250
now they are missing.

446
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,999
Nobody asked you to come.

447
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,500
On the contrary I was saying,

448
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,999
"Keep it low. Keep it low, so that we'll make it nice."

449
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,834
But you cannot have less than 350

450
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,208
or you can have three hundred,

451
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,667
you can have two hundred,

452
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,917
but you cannot just have 210.

453
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,500
Where to put them?

454
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,083
A simple thing - see all the mundane style.

455
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,709
But in other places what they have done?

456
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,000
"All right, we have to go. Mother will work it out."

457
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,834
It's worked out.

458
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:03,709
Everybody has got money, everything done, it's all here.

459
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,834
Americans have done it, surprisingly,

460
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,500
but English

461
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,500
- they don't know whether they are going or not.

462
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,208
Still there are some.

463
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,250
Poor Gavin has to run up and down for all of you.

464
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,208
I tell you, he is the one who has such patience.

465
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,792
And I was amazed

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,834
that there are still eleven people who have not paid,

467
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,583
can you believe it?

468
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,792
I mean, it's such a simple thing.

469
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,375
If you don't want to go, don't go.

470
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,667
If you want to go, you go.

471
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,375
Tell him you are not going or you are going, finished.

472
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,917
I mean, nobody wants you there.

473
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,083
But even this little thing you cannot because

474
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,375
you have a kind of a ...

475
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,792
because, because this has happened,

476
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:53,750
because that has happened, because ...

477
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,166
So the English have to come up much more,

478
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,959
because I have really worked for you people very, very hard,

479
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:06,166
and again God has given Me work again five years more;

480
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,875
I don't know what we are going to do.

481
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:12,750
Sometimes I feel I should not be back, because no use.

482
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,333
This is a small example I am giving,

483
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,542
very small example,

484
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:20,875
it's very mundane type.

485
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,875
You can see in other places also, like that.

486
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,166
You tell them anything,

487
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:28,291
"But why, Mother, it happens like that?

488
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,083
Why do I do like this?"

489
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:34,417
I mean, asking Me a question, asking Me the cause!

490
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:38,667
"Why did I behave like this? Why do I get into temper?"

491
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,333
Like I have known people

492
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,792
who have been coming to Sahaja Yoga,

493
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,500
doing Sahaja Yoga and all that,

494
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,959
but then they go to some other Steiner's place.

495
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,959
Then they go to some other courses.

496
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:56,625
I mean, they have no faith in Me - Sahaja Yoga.

497
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,999
They are practicing this, they are practicing that like mad,

498
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,417
still going on.

499
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,999
That's only possible in England, I tell you,

500
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,750
nowhere else - it's a speciality.

501
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,417
I have known of so many people who came to Sahaja Yoga;

502
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,625
without practicing Sahaja Yoga,

503
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:17,166
curing, helping them in Sahaja Yoga, working it out.

504
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,375
They leave Sahaja Yoga.

505
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,792
They're going to this place, that place, that ....

506
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,208
Is this the way?

507
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,333
Now I have known lots of people who

508
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,667
try to blame the leadership.

509
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,375
I am telling you all these things because

510
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,250
I was very sick when I came here, really I tell you,

511
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,458
I was sick for eight days and I was sick even afterwards;

512
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,667
because you know, you are all in My body and I suffer,

513
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,208
so I must tell you.

514
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,917
And then they say the leadership is no good,

515
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,500
leader should be very strong, the leader should be this,

516
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,041
and their leader must have a big thing in his hand,

517
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,291
and they said if he hits us,

518
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,750
we are not going to be all right.

519
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,792
Again the cause; again the cause.

520
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:07,333
I tell you, you have one of the best leaders in Gavin,

521
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:08,999
and I must tell you,

522
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,792
he is the man who spent a lot of money.

523
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,333
Without telling Me he has covered many expenses,

524
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,208
his office has worked for us.

525
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,291
He took all nonsensical people.

526
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,667
If I told him, "This fellow is getting some ego,"

527
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,625
he'll employ in his office.

528
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,333
If I say, "This fellow has got bhoots,"

529
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,083
he'll employ in his office.

530
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,041
He has worked with such bhoots

531
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,750
that I could not manage them even for a day.

532
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:39,041
He tries his level best to go to people and tell them that,

533
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,166
"See now, come."

534
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,333
He has saved so many people

535
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,667
by his sense, by his understanding;

536
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,917
but the only thing is he, openly he doesn't lead,

537
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,041
that's his mistake.

538
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:49,083
He should openly tell,

539
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:52,083
"You are a bhoot and get cured, then you'll be all right."

540
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,250
But if you say,

541
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,250
"Come here. You see, you are a bhoot, doesn't matter.

542
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,500
I have got lemons, ..., chillies. You sit down."

543
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Then, "Mother,

544
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,333
he is identifying himself with the greatest bhoot."

545
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,583
Let us face it.

546
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,959
If you have understanding of your leader,

547
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,917
then you should know that I know better than you know

548
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,291
about it.

549
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,458
And this is very saddening sometimes.

550
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,583
Why don't you understand the sheer goodness of a person?

551
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,250
The amount of bhoots he has tolerated in his office,

552
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,166
I tell you, I can't stand them for more than one day,

553
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,667
some of them.

554
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,375
So egoistical, some of them, off their heads,

555
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,166
and some of them are so bhootish

556
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,417
that even if they come downstairs

557
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:44,166
I get a pain in the stomach, in My house.

558
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,291
But he stood them.

559
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,041
Why? What was the need?

560
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:52,208
Just that he thought that he'd help them.

561
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,291
Whenever I told him that "This person is bhootish,"

562
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,999
I find him employed by Mr Gavin Brown.

563
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:01,083
Then one day I had to tell him, "Sack all of them,"

564
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,208
and they were sacked.

565
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,542
Why do we have the maximum number of bhoots in England,

566
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,250
I can't understand.

567
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,500
Is it necessary to have them around?

568
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,750
On the day when I am going I should not tell you these things,

569
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,999
but when I go away I find these bhoots come back,

570
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:24,625
and they become the causes, and the effects are shown.

571
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:31,041
So I have to make a complete open picture to you

572
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:35,041
to see that you can ascend to the highest of highest,

573
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,166
being born on this great land of this country.

574
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,667
But you can also go very down, I have seen that.

575
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,667
Because you're always blaming someone,

576
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,166
last of all Gavin,

577
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:52,417
and this is the worst thing that you have done.

578
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,500
Let anybody say that to Gregoire -

579
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,417
he'll chop that person off ten times

580
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,458
and bring that person to me in chopped stages!

581
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,875
Really, I mean!

582
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,041
He'll say, "What nonsense!

583
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:07,208
All right, it's ... go ahead."

584
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,458
You tell Mr.Warren,

585
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,417
I don't know what he'll do with all of the Australian type.

586
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,625
They are all gems, no doubt.

587
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:20,083
But you deserve a man like Gavin.

588
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:24,166
I thought, they are special people

589
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,625
that I've worked for you so much,

590
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,667
but I am amazed.

591
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:33,166
The decent people don't need such leaders, do you?

592
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,458
But the people who are decent now

593
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,208
turn out to be Australians, surprisingly,

594
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,542
the way they behave towards Me:

595
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,875
so sweet they are, you'd be surprised,

596
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,333
the children you know.

597
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,959
Gavin, he bought some cups and saucers for Me

598
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,166
because when I go there they thought they'll give Me tea

599
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,959
in good cups and saucers.

600
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,375
So he bought for all the centers one cup and saucer,

601
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,625
good one.

602
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,291
So the children, little, little children,

603
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,458
they collected money;

604
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:04,041
after all, Mother will have a cake, also must have a plate.

605
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:07,583
So they sent a check here, just see - how sweet!

606
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,375
But I never eat cakes, you know that, but still

607
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,750
- so sweet the children, I should say.

608
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,625
What is the reason?

609
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:24,625
Why do we dominate or get dominated?

610
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,625
Why?

611
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,917
Again the cause.

612
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,458
Go beyond the cause.

613
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:38,125
I bless you again and again that when I come next time,

614
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,000
see that you don't make any mistakes anymore.

615
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Meditate and meditate and meditate,

616
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,792
and when you come to India some of you,

617
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,709
I would like to show you as my prize things

618
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,000
from where I've worked, you know.

619
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,834
Even where I've not been, you see,

620
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:56,125
somebody else has given realization to someone in Nepal,

621
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,792
you see,

622
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,542
and they are wonderful flowers;

623
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,709
and here am I, something wrong with Me!

624
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,999
Where I have worked,

625
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:10,250
people are more worried about the causes.

626
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,875
I have to really make a very, very

627
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,792
straightforward appeal to you that now,

628
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,166
grow within yourself.

629
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,709
Are you magnanimous,

630
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:21,917
are you generous,

631
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,458
are you systematic?

632
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,542
Are you impressive,

633
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,417
are you kind,

634
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:28,083
are you collective?

635
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,709
Are you attached to all these nonsensical things still?

636
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,583
Do you talk big,

637
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,583
do you give big lectures?

638
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,709
Humble down yourself,

639
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,999
and then you'll see your greatness.

640
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,375
Unless and until you put your head down to your heart,

641
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,291
how will you see your Mother?

642
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,625
I wish you all great luck now,

643
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,999
and happy Christmas to you and happy New Year,

644
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,208
and a very great New Year in spiritual growth.

645
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Let's show it.

646
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,375
Let all of us decide today.

647
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,999
Forget about your wives and husbands and children,

648
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,291
and this and that nonsense.

649
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,750
Now you are yogis, you are united with Divine.

650
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,959
Grow in it, prosper in it.

651
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,999
May God bless you all.

652
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,375
Now the today's program

653
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,542
should not be very big because we are not allowed

654
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:38,834
lot of time,

655
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:42,625
but it's nice that today we could have a little puja of farewell.

656
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,250
But it should be a very small ... because it is,

657
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,999
how much you receive is the point,

658
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:51,291
because before going I don't want to have all kinds of chakras,

659
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,750
you see, going into spasms.

660
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,999
I am sometimes afraid of a puja in England.

661
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:06,041
Gavin, I think you can just ...

662
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,959
It's the mastery.

663
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,583
You must have the mastery,

664
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,125
upon yourself first of all.

665
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,959
If you are not a master you cannot act

666
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,834
- and upon your instrument, that's the point.

667
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,625
And I would not like anybody to disrespect

668
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,709
the leaders at all.

669
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,959
You may be very intelligent, that's outside Sahaja Yoga.

670
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,458
In Sahaja Yoga you have to listen to your leaders

671
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,500
and respect, and nobody should try to find faults.

672
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,709
I know his faults, what are his faults are,

673
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,834
and I know how to deal with them.

674
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,917
Everybody should try to strengthen.

675
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:57,000
Now I would say in Australia, which is a modern thing,

676
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,250
I should say that the whole thing works like one body.

677
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,709
Nobody questions Warren.

678
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:10,041
They telephone to him, they tell him, they collect money,

679
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:13,583
they put the money - it's all working like one body.

680
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:16,625
Here everybody is trying to cut the head

681
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:17,999
- or attack the heart;

682
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:27,375
that's your heart, that's your brain.

683
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:32,750
So please remember all of you should offer services

684
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,709
to Gavin,

685
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,166
to Sahaja Yoga,

686
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,458
before criticizing.

687
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,208
Those who say the books are not arriving,

688
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,875
let them take over the books.

689
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:51,417
Even booking My seats and all that he has to run, I know;

690
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:55,500
whatever you may say about ... he used to do all this.

691
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:01,041
So you should offer your services also,

692
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,417
to do these jobs.

693
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,041
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out.

694
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,625
We are not only here to take blessings

695
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,083
but we have certain duties also,

696
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,291
and that's what everybody should offer,

697
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,375
their measure: what can I do, how can I help?

698
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,875
What is the work? Let's see now.

699
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,417
I hope in the next meeting you all should sit down

700
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,625
and find out what you can do.

701
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:32,500
A group can be formed: two, three persons can sit and do it

702
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,041
with love, with attention,

703
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,166
so that his burden will be reduced, and you will all feel

704
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,417
the joy that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga.

705
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,125
Mother has done so much for you,

706
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,250
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

707
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,834
You want to have nice ashrams,

708
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,417
nice place to live there,

709
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,041
all right.

710
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,500
You want to have comfortable places, cheaper places,

711
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,834
all right.

712
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,166
You want to have good health,

713
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,125
all right.

714
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:00,834
You want to have fine children, all right; enjoy your life.

715
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,458
But what about giving,

716
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,625
giving your heart,

717
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,500
your respect?

718
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,917
Next time when I come back,

719
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:20,250
I want to see that you are all growing as one body.

720
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,709
At least the Heart should be integrated,

721
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,375
if nothing else.

722
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:25,917
Imagine a heart

723
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,709
which has the valves which pulsates at various times,

724
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:34,041
all muscles going at different wavelengths.

725
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:38,041
How can this universe survive with a heart like this?

726
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,041
So I have to request all the,

727
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:47,041
all the cells of the Heart to be alert,

728
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,625
to be one in unison with God,

729
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,583
and in loving care of the whole universe.

730
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,166
May God bless you.

731
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,250
So what is this puja supposed to be today?

732
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,166
It's farewell puja

733
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,999
today, so let's have it,

734
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,417
just before the birth of Christ.

735
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,041
Let Christ be born within us.

736
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,709
Let's be, like Him,

737
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,417
the one who always insisted,

738
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,875
"Love your brothers. Love your sisters."

739
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,750
Who are your brothers and sisters?

740
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,375
He asked the question too,

741
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,291
"Who are My brothers and sisters?"

742
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,291
"Sahaja yogis are my brothers and sisters."

743
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,000
Somebody offered at the altar.

744
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,875
He said, "What are you to offer at the altar?

745
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,333
Have you reconciled with your brother?"

746
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,458
Have you reconciled?

747
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:52,458
First reconcile, and then bring flowers to Mother.

748
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,417
He said it already.

749
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,625
Think of Him, how forgiving He was,

750
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,542
how magnanimous, how great, and how

751
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,458
He thought of His Father all the time,

752
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,291
completely dedicated,

753
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,000
doing His work.

754
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,917
So with all praises to Christ

755
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,625
and to His Mother who worked

756
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,917
in a very potential manner,

757
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,291
we have to today within ourselves

758
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,917
awaken that great Spirit,

759
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,291
which is actually the Aumkara.

760
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,417
Even the memory,

761
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,625
even the idea of that

762
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,542
is so joy-giving.

763
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,917
Let His life be reflected in your lives.

764
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,625
You have to be true Christians.

765
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,834
Let's have ... what is it? ....

766
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:16,542
I think ... Now I would say, next time when you come to puja,

767
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,250
all of you must have

768
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,959
the hundred-and-eight names of the Goddess.

769
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,291
You must have all the papers that are there.

770
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,417
Like we have these books,

771
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,291
all of us must have these papers,

772
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:30,709
not only one person should have.

773
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,875
We should try to remember certain things also:

774
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,083
the names of the Goddess,

775
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,959
the names that we recite.

776
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,417
We should read them again and again and understand them,

777
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,083
the Sanskrit meaning of it.

778
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,999
And it should come to us very easily,

779
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:48,291
because that is how we are going to work out our chakras.

780
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,750
I don't think we have names of Christ,

781
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,000
it's all right,

782
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:57,125
and this time I hope we will try to

783
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,250
read some names of Christ.

784
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,709
But we have the names of Ganesha but not of Christ,

785
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,625
so we'll say the hundred-and-eight names of Shri Ganesh,

786
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:11,458
and somebody can wash My feet, all right ....

787
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:17,583
Have you?

788
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,083
Well really, that's the best.

789
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:28,834
But so, I would say somebody should say now, let's see.

790
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,208
How many names we have? ....

791
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:34,125
Let Me create the names, and we'll give it to others.

792
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:37,667
Why should only Gavin keep the names?

793
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,083
It's not like a prime minister of this country,

794
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,917
you have chosen the leader.

795
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:53,125
Prime minister is paid money for,

796
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,792
she's - that's her job she is doing.

797
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,333
He is not doing his job.

798
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,458
You all are doing the job of God.

799
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,917
So why should there be any such thing that ...

800
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,834
Now somebody should read it,

801
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,000
and somebody can.

802
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,750
Now who will read it?

803
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,959
Now somebody should read it and somebody can wash My feet.

804
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,625
But don't do it too much, eh?

805
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,750
This is Christ - it's not easy to absorb.

806
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,166
All right, let's see.

807
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,375
Let's see how much love you have for Him,

808
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,750
how much you absorb Him ...

809
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:47,667
Get up now.

810
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,458
So you must get up to help, some of you.

811
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,542
And others also.

812
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,834
There's nothing to fear that there is ego or anything.

813
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,709
Don't keep back thinking,

814
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:04,583
"Oh, they think I'm just being ... " -  no, run!

815
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:06,333
Run for the job.

816
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,917
Now, what is it?

817
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,250
Get some things what you need.

818
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,250
Now, who will conduct the puja?

819
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,999
Bala, you can do it?

820
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,000
All right, come forward.

821
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,709
Some ladies can come also, what's the harm?

822
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,625
Now come here. ...

823
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,375
The water and all that ...

824
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,291
Now, you being friends,

825
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,000
you need not trouble too much ...

826
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,667
Who was born to teach us of His Father Sadashiva,

827
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,500
the everlasting Almighty God. Amen.

828
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,959
Aum twameva sakshat Shri Jesus sakshat

829
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,959

He is pure pranava energy.

He contains millions of universes.

836
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:26,083
He was born in the primordial cosmic egg.

837
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,959
He was conceived in the heart of Shri Mataji.

838
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:33,750
He was foretold by the prophets.

839
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:37,417
He was heralded by a star in the east.

840
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:40,959
He was attended by the three Magi,

841
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,291
who were Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.

842
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,999

He is the Savior who burns all our sins with His fire.

He adorns the Agnya Chakra.

Because tapasa - He stands at tapassvi.

00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:39,999
Now you see, that's why.

859
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:43,542
Ascetic, why? Because He is a tapassvi.

He is the narrow gate to the Kingdom of Heaven,

888
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:27,834
and He is the way.

889
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,667
All right.

890
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,291
He is the silence.

891
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,542
He is Lord Kartikeya.

892
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:47,041

00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:02,875
He is the light in the eyes of Shri Mahalakshmi.

897
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,625
He is obedient to His Mother.

898
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,041
He is the perfect Sahaja yogi.

899
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,875
He is the perfect brother.

900
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,291
He is the embodiment of joy.

901
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:21,291
He is the embodiment of gentleness.

902
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,709
He spits out the half-hearted.

903
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,875
He condemns the adulterous eyes.

904
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:34,417
He condemns all fanatics.

905
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:39,166
Actually, neutralizes the adulterous eyes.

906
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:41,417
He makes the adulterous eyes innocent,

907
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,500
because He is innocence.

908
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,583
He is uninterested in riches.

909
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:58,834
He gives all riches to His devotees.

910
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,917
He is pure white.

911
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,750
No, this is, you can't say He is uninterested

912
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,583
in rituals - what makes you  think?

913
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,083
The rituals which are real ...

914
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,834
See, the one who is riches,

915
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,125
how can He be interested in riches?

916
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,834
That's the point ...

917
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,709
Riches He is.

918
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,709
Not interested at all, because He being the riches

919
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,625
- that is gunatita, as you call it - you see,

920
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,000
the being and the non-being.

921
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,500
When you are the non-being,

922
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,709
you cannot be interested in the being.

923
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,250
Beyond, He is beyond.

924
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,917
He is the  sacred heart.

925
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,583
He wears a crown of thorns.

926
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,625
He condemns misery.

927
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:06,250
He suffered so that we should enjoy.

928
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:13,125
He is a child, yet He is the ever ancient.

931
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,458
equally to those who are first or last.

932
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,500
He is ever with us.

933
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,917
He is beyond the universe.

934
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,792
He is the sign of the cross.

935
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:36,125

00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,625
He is the pure power of desire.

952
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,625
His church is the heart.

953
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:47,000
He has the eleven destroying powers.

954
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,291
He is the destroyer of false prophets.

955
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,875
He is the destroyer of untruth.

956
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:55,625
He is the destroyer of intolerance.

957
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,625
He is the destroyer of racialism.

958
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,458
He is the destroyer of anger.

959
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:06,583
Of fanaticism - it's very much so.

960
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,166
He is the herald of the Golden Age.

961
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,000
He is worshipped by our Mother.

962
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,875
He is praised by our Mother.

963
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,583
He is loved by our Mother.

964
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
He is the one who is chosen.

965
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:28,000
He is awakened in all Sahaja yogis.

966
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,125
He who rides the white horse at the end of the age.

967
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,166
He is the end of our fears.

968
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,250
He guards the gate of our Mother.

969
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,000
He is the only way to the Kingdom of God.

970
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:49,875
Aum Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahavishnu sakshat

971
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,375
Shri Mahavirata sakshat

972
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,625
Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

973
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,583
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

974
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,000
I think the word "worshipped" should be "adored by our Mother"

975
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:55,625
because He didn't like it, I think,

976
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:57,041
it's catching on the Agnya.

977
00:57:57,709 --> 00:57:59,500
So it's "is adored by."

978
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,583
See, He's so particular - you see,

979
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:05,500
the protocol is not all right, that's why.

980
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,500
See - better!

981
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,458
Agnya was fine. See?

982
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,458
Some catches there are.

983
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,166
I was wondering which one of them was.

984
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:19,000
Now we'll say, "He is adored by our Mother."

985
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,709
He is adored by our Mother.

986
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:23,041
Again, three times.

987
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,792
He is adored by our Mother.

988
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,166
Again.

989
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:27,709
He is adored by our Mother.

990
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,500
He is adored by our Mother.

991
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,208
See? He's very particular.

992
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,792
May God bless you.

993
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,041
You got the meaning of that?

994
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:14,458
The description of Mahalakshmi, what She gives you,

995
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:21,250
and also the description about Her relationship with Vishnu,

996
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:24,000
with Hari - is Shri Krishna,

997
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,959
that She is the beloved of Shri Krishna (Hari)

998
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:30,125
Is the beloved of Shri Krishna;

999
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:32,959
and that's how it explains how Mahalakshmi,

1000
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:36,458
if She is Mary, then Mary is Radha.

1001
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
This has to be done by boys

1002
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:11,250
who haven't got the feeling of marriage,

1003
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:15,709
or think of it. It has to be that pure.
