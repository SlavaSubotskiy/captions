1
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:14,241
When you are all meditating and inside I also
find it difficult to be outside.

2
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:25,701
So today you have arranged to have this puja
here.

3
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:35,251
Just before that you have to prepare yourself
physically and mentally.

4
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:43,931
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan
and a bandhan is nothing but you give yourself

5
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:47,191
a protection to your aura.

6
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:54,381
How you do it is very simple which I will
tell you just now how to do it and then you

7
00:00:54,381 --> 00:01:00,411
sit down for your puja.

8
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:03,781
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

9
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:07,941
First of all, you should not feel guilty at
all.

10
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:13,461
If you are guilty you cannot do my puja.

11
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:17,161
You should be absolutely above that.

12
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,341
There should be no tension in your mind.

13
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,031
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

14
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:27,521
Like flowers you are looking.

15
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,400
How can flowers be guilty?

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,970
First get out of that guilt business.

17
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,341
You should not feel guilty or tense.

18
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,211
Everything that is done is the best.

19
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:38,891
You shouldn’t worry about it.

20
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,131
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange
it.

21
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,191
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

22
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:52,751
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga
you’ll be surprised to see how things are

23
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,931
arranged just beautifully.

24
00:01:54,931 --> 00:02:02,771
When these people were looking for a place
there was no place for less than $250 each.

25
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:07,161
They said this is too much for everybody’s
pocket.

26
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:11,391
Then suddenly, spontaneously they found this
place.

27
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:13,281
When they said $50 nobody could believe.

28
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:20,211
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge
in the morning and the rest of it will be

29
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,211
fasting.

30
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,671
So many were rather worried.

31
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:28,081
Some thought it was a scout camping ground
or whatever it is and quite worried when it

32
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,331
starts raining.

33
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:34,992
But this is all God’s grace to get such
a place, such a comfortable place for you.

34
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:40,129
You come here and everything is arranged by
God’s grace.

35
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:44,082
So first we have to remember that it is all arrange through God's grace

36
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:48,613
If something is not arranged just forget it,
just leave it, just don’t worry.

37
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:49,898
That’s the best way,

38
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:51,030
you have to live

39
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:58,310
Then what happens is that you become one with
the present and you can overcome all your

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,121
problems of tension.

41
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:05,391
Tension mounts up when we want to do that
which you are not supposed to do, with which

42
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,355
we are not successful.

43
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:12,891
There is also a mental barrier between ourselves
and our mind that we want to do a particular

44
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,241
thing in a particular way.

45
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:22,421
If you can give up that, then you will be
surprised that you become absolutely one with

46
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:27,641
the Divine and you start working it out in
a very beautiful manner.

47
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,681
Now see the root of a little seed.

48
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:35,810
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

49
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,930
If it finds there is an obstruction, there
is some sort of a stone or something, it goes

50
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,930
around it.

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,971
Then it finds another obstruction, it goes
away from it.

52
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,931
It doesn’t fight that but just says, “All
right, let me find my own way."

53
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:55,571
Then he uses the same stone for holding the
tree.

54
00:03:55,571 --> 00:04:04,561
So clever, he goes around the little stone
and uses that for its own purpose.

55
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,891
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

56
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:13,242
Not to take responsibility and put others
into tension: “This must be done."

57
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,203
“This is not here."

58
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,458
“That is not there."

59
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:16,483
It’s not necessary.

60
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,724
It’s your love that is important.

61
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:25,551
For which you must have heard the story of
an old woman who was living in a forest.

62
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:32,791
Her name was Shavari and she heard that Shri
Ram was going to come in the forest.

63
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,248
And she was so much

64
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:35,890
elated,

65
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,230
so much happy.

66
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,311
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know
what to do.

67
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:46,529
When Rama came she gave Him, we have some kind of berry, we called as ber, to eat and she told in very

68
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:51,326
we called as ber, she gave them to Him
to eat and she told in very

69
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:57,461
great innocence that everyone of them I have
tested to see that they are not sour.

70
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:01,970
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

71
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:05,317
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

72
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,620
He got very angry.

73
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:07,836
He said, “What is this?

74
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,047
This lady has no sense.

75
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:14,150
She is giving all these things which are eaten
by her, first of all."

76
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,044
It’s what we call as uttishtha

77
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:19,077
means that somebody else has eaten, then you are not supposed to eat

78
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,039
even your say, your brother has

79
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,561
eaten something, you cannot eat that.

80
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:28,266
It’s regarded as something not good,
not auspicious.

81
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:32,451
“And this lady, an old lady with her few
teeth that are left, she has just pierced

82
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,248
every ber and has given to my brother."

83
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:37,079
very furious.

84
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:47,171
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the
whole situation and then Rama gave that ber

85
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:52,042
to his wife and she ate it.

86
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:57,225
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said,
see brother-in-law

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,601
“These are the best bers I have ever eaten.
I’ve never had such a taste before."

88
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,212
But I’m not going to give you anything."

89
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:08,439
See, the best way to challenge the ego is
not to say that you are not going to have it.

90
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:09,606
He said, “Why?”

91
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,161
She said, “No, I won’t give you.

92
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,743
You won’t have them, I will not.

93
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:13,900
I will eat all of them."

94
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,153
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

95
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:19,678
He snatched some of them and he ate and also
felt the same thing.

96
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,576
Because they are given out of love.

97
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:28,841
Whatever is done out of love is a thousand-fold
better than that is done out of tension and

98
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,061
problem.

99
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:35,321
I should never like to cause any tension in
your mind of any kind.

100
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,481
So for small, small things you should not worry.

101
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:44,231
You must give up your tensions absolutely
and understand that you are the children of

102
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,051
God.

103
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,438
You are to be looked after.

104
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:50,183
You are to given everything that is available
in His realm.

105
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,581
You should not get into tension at all.

106
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:58,085
Firstly, not to feel guilty, thirdly to feel
that we had to go to this guru, that guru?

107
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,594
All right, forget it.

108
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,387
Forget it.

109
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:01,736
Whatever has happened has happened.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,466
Forget it!

111
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:06,681
Don’t worry on that point also because that
will tie you down all the time saying, “Why

112
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,260
did you go to that guru?

113
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,809
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

114
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:11,912
Why did you do this?

115
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:15,679
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

116
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:16,945
I am not bothered."

117
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,742
Whatever has happened, has happened
that person is finished.

118
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,909
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

119
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:22,996
I have nothing to do."

120
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,384
So be in the present, that is very important.

121
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,400
Be in the present,

122
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:33,178
have no guilt, have no worries of the past
because if you worry of the past you can never

123
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,831
enjoy the present.

124
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,960
You are here to enjoy and not to worry about
the past.

125
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:41,036
What ever has happend, has happend,
just forget it.

126
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:47,238
I hope you understand this very well and to
forget whatever has happened and forgive.

127
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,381
There are Sahaja Yogis with you.

128
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,603
Enjoy life.

129
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:53,944
Always try to see the good points of other
Sahaja Yogis and not the bad points.

130
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,411
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong
with another person, especially when we know

131
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,411
about chakras.

132
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:03,400
We just understand that this person has got
these very bad chakras.

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,511
Then the only thing what to do is to give
yourself a bandhan, which I will tell you,

134
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,775
and deal with the person.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,640
But when you know that person has this sickness
or this kind of a chakra caught up, no use

136
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,160
arguing, no use telling them.

137
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,011
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

138
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,830
Tell them that this is what it is.

139
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,731
At the most you can tell your children, you
can tell your wife.

140
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:30,465
But somebody who is not [UNCLEAR] connected,
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

141
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,739
 You cannot be forced Sahaja Yoga in to them

142
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,178
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

143
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:39,106
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

144
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,121
It has its own protocol.

145
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:46,931
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

146
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:52,929
There are some people who still have lots
of doubts, I know that, who are sitting here

147
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:53,816
who have doubts.

148
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,238
These should go away.

149
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,716
Because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

150
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:03,015
Please get rid of those doubts if possible
because I do not want that you should feel

151
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,438
later on that, “Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

152
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:08,041
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

153
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,126
One thing that one should understand that
Mataji has nothing to gain from us.

154
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,111
We cannot give her anything.

155
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,590
We cannot give her anything.

156
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,907
Only we have to take from Her.

157
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:22,024
If you understand that then you’ll have
no doubts because that is one of the fears

158
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,211
people have. That I’m going to start
having something from you.

159
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:30,861
So once you understand that she has nothing
to take away from us, she has to give us something.

160
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,917
Supposing I say there is a diamond available
here free for you, will you doubt me?

161
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,560
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if
it’s a diamond or a {UNCLEAR].

162
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:42,191
That’s how your attitude should be.

163
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:47,381
Those who have doubts should know that those
who have doubts will go very slow and they

164
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:49,141
may be thrown out.

165
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,697
So please don’t have any doubts.

166
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,484
A doubting mind is the most troubling thing.

167
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,416
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

168
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,493
There is no need to doubt about it.

169
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,897
This is opening,

170
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:07,371
everything is so open, there is no secret
about it.

171
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:15,420
You understand that and try to imbibe the
quality of a good Sahaja Yogi, of a Sahaja

172
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,754
Yogi who is steady.

173
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:24,201
By doubting, the steadiness will go away and
if a tree is not steady how will it imbed

174
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,201
itself?

175
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:28,244
It’s important that you should give up all
doubts.

176
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,114
You are so quickly into it.

177
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,969
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,
we never have done like that before.

178
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,320
It’s an experiment.

179
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:39,644
We want to see now how it works out.

180
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:40,729
It’s really an experiment.

181
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,094
We have never done like this before.

182
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,175
It’s a very dangerous thing.

183
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,863
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja
then they might get little stomach pain or

184
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,276
or something,

185
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:54,291
something will happen to you by which you
get cleared out, little bit.

186
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,633
Not much but then you’ll feel much better
out of that.

187
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,912
So it is a thing that has to happen.

188
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:03,151
It’s just like an operation which takes
place.

189
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:07,807
First we used to do is the cleansing of the
the people, of the chakras, this, that

190
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,986
When they are cleansed and have reached a
certain position then only they were allowed

191
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,481
to do my puja.

192
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:17,816
But I found that when I came first to America
I did not talk about puja at all.

193
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:19,642
I talked about abstract things.

194
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,603
I didn’t want to say about these things.

195
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:26,872
We did not do any puja, we did not establish
Shri Ganesha, nothing of the kind, and as

196
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:29,960
a result of that people who came to me got
lost.

197
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:33,407
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health
all right or about anything.

198
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:37,381
It was just such a short time and the whole
thing was a bad response from people that

199
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,189
I thought it better to leave it now.

200
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:45,506
But now time has come for all of you to have
it in a big way because you are all seekers

201
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:47,581
and we cannot delay it anymore.

202
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,601
So come to me without any doubt.

203
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,810
If you have doubts it’s better that you
go away.

204
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:55,699
It’d be a better idea for me and for you
also.

205
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,557
When you’re doubts are removed then you
come for the puja.

206
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:02,491
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise
I will have a headache.

207
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:05,331
Apart from that you will have a headache.

208
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:11,971
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive
mood and see for yourself what happens to

209
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,850
you.

210
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,233
May God bless you.
