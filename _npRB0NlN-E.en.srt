1
00:00:02,889 --> 00:01:00,600
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:18,610
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha
Rudra.

3
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:35,980
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of
the Spirit.

4
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:51,590
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

5
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,000
He forgives, because we are human beings,
we commit mistakes,

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,750
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:08,539
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives
us.

8
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:25,620
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

9
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,870
we do immoral things,

10
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:46,970
we do thieving, and we do things that 
are against God,

11
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,110
talk against Him.

12
00:02:51,110 --> 00:03:10,970
He also forgives our superficialities, jealousies,
our lust, our anger.

13
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:28,760
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,409
vanities and also possessiveness.

15
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,519
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

16
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,180
and also our subordination to wrong things.

17
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:52,450
But every action has a reaction,

18
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:08,420
and when He forgives, He thinks that He has
given you a big grace-mark,

19
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,190
and that reaction builds up within Him

20
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:23,380
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

21
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:34,560
try to do greater mistakes.

22
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Specially, after realisation,

23
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,830
because such a big blessing there is of the
realisation,

24
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,480
you’ve got the light and, in the light,
if you are holding onto a snake

25
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,000
then His wrath goes up because he sees how
stupid you have been.

26
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:24,900
What I am saying is that after realisation,
specially, He is much more sensitive

27
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,710
that, people who are forgiven and have been
given such a big thing

28
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,420
like Self-realisation, still they do wrong
things

29
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,360
then he is much more wrathful.

30
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,820
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts
reducing and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

31
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,670
But when He forgives and, as a result of that
forgiveness

32
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,000
you feel the gratitude, then His blessings
start flowing towards you.

33
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,130
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive
others.

34
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,130
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,
He pacifies your greed.

35
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,130
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come
on our being and

36
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,900
we become really beautiful flowers,

37
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,610
and we start shining in the sunshine of His
blessings.

38
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,310
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

39
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,500
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

40
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:17,160
He protects realised souls at every point,
in every way.

41
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,850
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

42
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,720
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous
power of protection.

43
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,870
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided
into right path.

44
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:45,260
All the beautiful blessings of His are described
in the Psalm 23

45
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,250
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

46
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,970
The Lord is my Shepherd”

47
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,340
Is all described how he looks after you as
a shepherd.

48
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,374
But He does not look after the evil people
He destroys them.

49
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:06,190
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are
still carrying on with their evil nature

50
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,680
are destroyed.

51
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate
and do not rise He destroys,

52
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:26,850
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

53
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:39,960
Those who murmur against God and live in a
way

54
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:50,580
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes
them from [it].

55
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,890
So by one force, He protects, by another force,
He throws away.

56
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:11,010
But His destructive forces when they are built
up too much, then we call it :

57
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:18,250
"Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

58
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:26,240
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

59
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,310
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

60
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,470
means the destructive power which will destroy
all

61
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,430
that is negative on this earth and save all
that is positive.

62
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,090
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

63
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,240
to expedite their ascent,

64
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,610
not to be satisfied with the social life or
married life

65
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,440
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed
upon you.

66
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,420
We always see, what God has done for us,

67
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:10,400
how He has been miraculous to us, but we have
to see what we have done to ourselves,

68
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:23,640
what are 
we doing about our own ascent and growth.

69
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,870
Now the…out of the eleven centres……

70
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,970
Ekadesha, means eleven,

71
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:40,080
the five come from the right side of your
void,

72
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,890
and five from the left side of your void.

73
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:53,030
The first five on the left hand side come
from:

74
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:59,280
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

75
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,880
or if you have read wrong books,

76
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:12,340
or if you have been in the company of wrong
people,

77
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:23,760
or if you have been sympathetic towards people
who have been following wrong paths,

78
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,900
or you have been yourself one of the agents
or guru of these wrong people.

79
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,050
Now these five problems can be solved, if
we completely give up

80
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,120
whatever wrong we have been doing.

81
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,670
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to
beat the Shaitan, means the Satan,

82
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,670
with shoes;

83
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,800
but that has to be done not mechanically but
from your heart.

84
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,890
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will
tell me,

85
00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:01,790
“My father is following this guru; that
father is following that guru,”

86
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,280
and get involved with their father, sister,
this, that

87
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,430
and try to take them out from those gurus,
also get entangled.

88
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,910
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

89
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,670
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

90
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:27,030
and her parents and parents-in-law said that
the child must be baptised,

91
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,220
and I told her, you cannot get this child
baptised

92
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,860
because it’s a realised soul.

93
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,310
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,
and she took the child for baptism

94
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:49,370
and the child became very funny – it was
really like a mad child.

95
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:57,279
Now then she gave up all that and so she has
saved.

96
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,620
But supposing she had another child and she
would have done the same thing,

97
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:11,220
the second child would have been something
very, very bad.

98
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,360
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is

99
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,930
that anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

100
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,800
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

101
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,340
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

102
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,450
or you should feel it in your body,

103
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:40,180
or with your intelligence you should understand
what is Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,710
A person who is still negative always gets
attracted towards other one

105
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,480
who is a very,very powerfully negative

106
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,960
and does not understand that the other person
is so powerfully negative,

107
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,600
but gets impressed.

108
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Under such circumstances, such a person is
hit by that negative person

109
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,380
and Shiva cannot protect.

110
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,750
One should not have sympathy with anyone who
is negative,

111
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,680
whether he is mad, whether there is something
wrong with him,

112
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,110
whether he is your relation, or anything.

113
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,390
No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a
kind of a anger

114
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,700
should be there for that person,

115
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,029
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

116
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,840
And this angry detachment is the only time

117
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,640
when you have to be angry.

118
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:46,660
But I have seen people who have anger for
very good sahaja yogis

119
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,880
but not for their own husbands or wives who
are extremely negative.

120
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,340
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on
these five sides

121
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,310
on the, we should say, on the right side it
moves,

122
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,840
because it comes from the left and moves to
the right side,

123
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:19,540
then a person starts becoming negative but
acting with his ego.

124
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:28,190
Such a person may take up a situation into
hands and say that

125
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:37,300
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am
so, we should do like this

126
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,120
and we should behave like this”, and start
dictating people.

127
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,500
[They] can do anything.

128
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,590
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja
yogis

129
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,319
may try to understand [him],

130
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,250
but most will know that “This fellow is
going out,

131
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,190
now he’s on his way out!”

132
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:02,760
So, all these things lead to this left side
development,

133
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:10,140
or we can call it on the head, on the right
hand side of your medha,

134
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,770
this plate, brain-plate

135
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,420
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

136
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,550
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea
people have that,

137
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,290
“I am myself a big guru.”

138
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:32,399
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also,
as if

139
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,360
they have become great gurus.

140
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,290
We have known some people who give big lectures

141
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,990
in any programme and never allow

142
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,310
my tape to be played or anything.

143
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,640
They think they have now become experts.

144
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,890
Then some of them say that now we have become
so great

145
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,839
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

146
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:14,110
there’s no need to do meditation – there
are some like that also.

147
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,670
And then there are some who say

148
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:24,090
that "sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja
yogis,

149
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,700
we are very great evolved souls".

150
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:42,680
But the worst of all are those who just take
my name

151
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:49,839
saying that “Mother has said so and I am
telling you because Mother has said”

152
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,450
– when I have never said such a thing, is
all falsehood.

153
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,970
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga
money

154
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:06,390
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way, exploit
them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

155
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,780
And such people become very inauspicious.

156
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,790
Anyone who tries such things will go out of
Sahaja Yoga

157
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,790
with disgrace.

158
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,120
But one should never go near such a person,

159
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,940
have nothing to do with such a person, have
no sympathies.

160
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,260
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone
to any extent,

161
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,390
so better keep out of such people.

162
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,150
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within
a person,

163
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,940
then definitely such a person gets diseases
like cancer

164
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,060
and incurable horrible diseases.

165
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,460
Specially, when the eleventh one which is
actually here,

166
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,900
which is the Viraatas chakra,

167
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,920
which is the collectivity,

168
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,210
when it is affected as well, then such a person
cannot get out of this disease.

169
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,950
But these…out of these even five are combined,

170
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,300
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

171
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,440
then they get into very serious type of dirty
diseases.

172
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,210
That’s why, I always say that be careful
about your Agnya chakra,

173
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,080
because that is one of the worst things,

174
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:35,270
that, once it starts getting combined with
these Ekadeshas, part of the Ekadeshas,

175
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:40,330
then anything can happen to a person,

176
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,280
he can meet with a horrible accident,

177
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,590
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be
murdered by someone,

178
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,309
anything can happen to such a person who has
got the right Agnya

179
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:02,620
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or
left.

180
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:19,610
That means, the five of these, if they, any
one of the five,

181
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,710
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

182
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,530
the protective powers of God are minimum.

183
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,510
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

184
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,640
say now I am speaking,

185
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,680
now you should watch Me constantly,

186
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,036
so that there is thoughtless awareness and
the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

187
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,060
But, don’t pay attention here and there
all the time.

188
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,780
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention
will neutralise

189
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,630
into thoughtless awareness,

190
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:52,020
and your attention would be fixed in such
a manner

191
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,620
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

192
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,520
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch
you,

193
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,750
that is your fortress.

194
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,650
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless
awareness,

195
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:13,799
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

196
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:21,360
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright,
Mother we are doing.”

197
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,790
Mechanically, they do and say,

198
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,630
“I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

199
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,990
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness,
minimum of minimum?

200
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:43,380
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out
of your head?

201
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,520
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

202
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,549
it is not going to help; help you or help
anyone.

203
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,830
So, after realisation, as you are very well
protected,

204
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,840
you have all the blessings and a great future,

205
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,530
you also have a great possibility of a complete
annihilation.

206
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,780
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

207
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,480
and everybody is supporting you to climb,
holding your hand,

208
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,840
and there are so many things by which you
are protected, to be taken upward,

209
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,460
there’s no possibility of falling off by
mistake also,

210
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:29,460
but if you try to remove your bondages with
Truth and Love

211
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,260
and all the time try to hit the people who
are trying to support you,

212
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,510
then you fall from a great height, greater
height.

213
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,710
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater
you fall,

214
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,250
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

215
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:54,080
But every effort is made by the Divine, every
support is given to you,

216
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,570
every care is taken.

217
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,200
Despite that, if you want to fall,

218
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,950
then from that height, is very dangerous.

219
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,070
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such
a time when somebody tries

220
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,760
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga,

221
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,080
after being in Sahaja Yoga,

222
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,970
then hits you so badly

223
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,650
that the whole attack is very widespread.

224
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:33,730
But the whole family can be protected if there
are few people of that family

225
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,559
doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

226
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:47,690
But in case the family that is against all
the time of sahaja yogis

227
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,620
and try to trouble them,

228
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,370
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad
way.

229
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:06,830
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as
I told you, from the Void.

230
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:17,120
So, we can say that the destruction part of
it comes from the Void mainly.

231
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,870
But these are the powers, all are given in
one person

232
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,710
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus
Christ.

233
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,080
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

234
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,200
He’s the personification of Omkara,

235
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,180
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

236
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,700
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe
starts breaking.

237
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,929
As He personifies the power of the Mother

238
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:50,179
which is penetrating into every atom, into
every molecule, and to every human being,

239
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,710
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

240
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:01,950
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets
into a jeopardy.

241
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,170
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

242
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,700
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like
small children”

243
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:24,190
That is, the innocence, the purity of the
heart is the best way you can please Him.

244
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:33,940
As in the West, specially, people have developed
their brains too much,

245
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,640
they try to play about with words

246
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,950
and think that nobody knows what they are
doing.

247
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:57,000
All such people must know that everything
you do is known to God.

248
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,710
If you are not clean in heart,

249
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,290
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

250
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,160
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

251
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:14,570
Such people are not possessed, nor they are
conditioned, nor they are egoistical,

252
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:27,290
but they are very cunning clever people and
they are quite aware, as to what they are

253
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,290
doing.

254
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,220
But, there are people who get possessed also

255
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,520
and then they, in that , they try to destroy
themselves

256
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,250
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

257
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:56,200
There are some who think that if they hurt
themselves or do some sort of an extreme thing

258
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,560
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

259
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,250
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

260
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:12,170
then you should know that something is wrong
with you.

261
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,640
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga

262
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,049
then you must know that there’s something
definitely wrong with you.

263
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:29,130
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja
yogis,

264
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,300
then it’s sure something is wrong with you.

265
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,270
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness
of God,

266
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,420
then something wrong with you.

267
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:47,140
If you are still worried about negative people
and their problems

268
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,110
then know that there’s something wrong with
you.

269
00:26:50,110 --> 00:27:00,870
If you have sympathies with negative people,
then also there’s something wrong with you.

270
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,240
But if you have anger for negative and all
that is negative

271
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,290
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are
there.

272
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,580
When this thing gets matured then you become
the power

273
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,190
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

274
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,679
Anybody who will try to insult you

275
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,760
or to do any harm, will collapse.

276
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,789
It has happened with many people who tried
to be insulting to Me

277
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,809
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

278
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,830
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

279
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:41,000
So one has to be in such a way that they become
the Ekadesha.

280
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,500
Nobody can touch such people.

281
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,920
But such a person is full of compassion and
forgiveness.

282
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,450
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

283
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,450
The more compassionate you are the more powerful
Ekadesha becomes.

284
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,679
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha
acts.

285
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,590
Many people have a habit of receding back
into their exclusion

286
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,090
and saying “Oh we better be at home and
it’s alright,”

287
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,630
but they don’t know what they are missing.

288
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,940
Whatever may be your experience with others,
you should stick-on together,

289
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,900
always attend programmes, take leadership,
go ahead with it,

290
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,410
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

291
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,660
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers, I would
say, of destruction, together.

292
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,549
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

293
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:24,250
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

294
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:31,620
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

295
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,230
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

296
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:41,090
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana,
Kartikeya and Ganesha.

297
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,450
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

298
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,020
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations
are Ekadeshas.

299
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,860
Now the last but not the least, is the destructive
power

300
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,750
of Hiranyagarbha which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

301
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,640
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

302
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,919
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive
power.

303
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,460
So, thus, the complete total destructive power
is Ekadesha Rudra.

304
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,530
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but
it’s not blind.

305
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,350
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately
woven.

306
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,730
It avoids all the good points and attacks
the wrong things

307
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,030
and it hits at the right time, at the right
point,

308
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,059
direct, without hitting anything that is good
in between.

309
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,150
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon
someone,

310
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:32,250
say, for example, and there is something in
between which is divine or which is a positive

311
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,250
thing

312
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:41,059
[then] it penetrates through positive, without
harming the positive

313
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,360
and hits the negative.

314
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,650
It cools down somebody and burns another.

315
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,080
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools
down.

316
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,030
So that is how it works with such care and
such delicacy.

317
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,290
And it is tremendously sharp also.

318
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,460
And it’s very painful.

319
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:11,190
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

320
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,140
it goes on slowly, slowly.

321
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,049
All the horrible tortures that you have learnt

322
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:21,020
or heard about are expressions of Ekadesha
only.

323
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,110
For example, take the case of cancer.

324
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,390
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is

325
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,390
removed,

326
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,300
then everything goes on, one after [another],
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

327
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,770
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot
feel their fingers,

328
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:49,660
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything
eats their fingers

329
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,940
they can’t feel it, so they start losing
their fingers,

330
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,809
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

331
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,220
But this wrathfulness of the Father can be
very gentle and could be very sweet,

332
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
when it comes to His own children.

333
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
The story is about the Mother

334
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
– once She got very angry, the Primordial
Mother.

335
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,940
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy
the whole world with Her Ekadesha power

336
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,700
and She tried to destroy the whole world.

337
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,150
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself
felt that She is being

338
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,280
[a] bit too much angry.

339
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,870
So when She started destroying, and She was
going right and left,

340
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:36,490
He did not know what to do, so He took Her
child,

341
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:46,690
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can
say, representing Christ

342
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:58,409
or representing anyone of these great children
of Her’s, that he put the child

343
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:00,520
under Her feet.

344
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,039
So, when She was stamping,

345
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:11,260
suddenly She saw Her own child under Her feet
and Her such a big tongue came out.

346
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,710
She just stopped.

347
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,710
Balancing.

348
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,200
But this has happened only once.

349
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,190
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately the
complete destruction comes

350
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,260
through the anger of Sadashiva.

351
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,370
When the final total destruction takes place.

352
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:41,140
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

353
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,190
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves
Ekadesha Rudra.

354
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,390
Now to develop this power

355
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,350
one has to develop a tremendous power of detachment,

356
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,990
power of detachment, detachment from negative.

357
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,960
For example, negativity can come from very
near people,

358
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,240
like brother, mother, sister, could come from
friends, could come from relatives.

359
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,309
It could come from a country, it could come
from your political ideas, economic ideas,

360
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:13,620
anything like that.

361
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,690
Any misidentification can destroy your power
of Ekadesha Rudra.

362
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:33,429
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I
am surrendered to Sahaja Yoga

363
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,260
and I am a sahaja yogi,”

364
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,990
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja
Yoga.

365
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,630
So that, intelligently, you understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:51,410
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent

367
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:58,080
and if the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter
into their intelligence

368
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,110
you can never overcome your attachments.

369
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:17,190
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about
Sahaja Yoga or you give lectures on that,

370
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,970
but mentally you should also understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:30,049
Today is a special day when it has been asked
that

372
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:34,289
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

373
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:41,359
and is for all kinds of false religious sects
and false gurus

374
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:54,769
and false religions, which are followed in
the name of God,

375
00:34:54,769 --> 00:35:00,329
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

376
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:22,170
and does not achieve Self-realisation and
does not get connected with God, is false.

377
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,569
So any such thing that is just faith and talks
of God

378
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:29,619
but has no connection with God

379
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,580
cannot be a true religion.

380
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,400
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

381
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:43,400
but in giving that balance, if people live
on that money

382
00:35:43,400 --> 00:36:07,609
and try to enjoy a wealth out of that money,

383
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:16,750
then it is not even at the very lower level
is religion.

384
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:34,170
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to
give a balance to begin with,

385
00:36:34,170 --> 00:37:32,660
but in that balancing when 
they tell, “You have to 

386
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,289
be balanced,

387
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:49,980
but give me money for that,

388
00:37:49,980 --> 00:38:03,999
you must give me money, give me all your purse,
give me everything,”

389
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:23,969
then that cannot be balanced, it does not
even have a slightest thing of the blessings

390
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:31,960
of God.

391
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:52,309
Or any religion that makes you bow to 
anybody else but the incarnation,

392
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:56,999
is no religion.

393
00:38:56,999 --> 00:39:19,519
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

394
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:47,530
The real religion will give you a balance
and will always talk

395
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:54,499
about the ascent.

396
00:39:54,499 --> 00:40:30,800
But they will not ask for money or make one
man something great as venerated.

397
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,910
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between
falsehood, negative things

398
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,329
and real things.

399
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:44,099
Once you develop that discrimination through
vibratory awareness,

400
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:51,210
or through your intelligence, you are in the
control of yourself.

401
00:40:51,210 --> 00:42:12,049
And then 

402
00:42:12,049 --> 00:43:29,890
you become that power 

403
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:40,279
of Ekadesha,

404
00:43:40,279 --> 00:44:08,440
when you establish your maturity.

405
00:44:08,440 --> 00:46:25,819
Today, I bless you all, that 

406
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:29,339
you all

407
00:46:29,339 --> 00:48:18,999
become the 

408
00:48:18,999 --> 00:50:08,559
power of Ekadesha Rudra

409
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:32,519
and 

410
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:47,690
you develop 

411
00:50:47,690 --> 00:53:54,710
that sincerity which takes you to that state.

412
00:53:54,710 --> 00:59:41,359
May 

413
00:59:41,359 --> 01:00:38,089
God 

414
01:00:38,089 --> 01:03:49,509
Bless you.
