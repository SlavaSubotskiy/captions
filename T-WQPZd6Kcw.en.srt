1
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:29,673
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

2
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:44,633
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

3
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:52,745
When it becomes so deep, then there is
no movement.

4
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:04,368
This is a great country. Australia has
been created

5
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:12,813
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:28,740
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where
resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

7
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:42,436
How important it is to keep this centre
awakened within.

8
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:48,250
The information about My coming

9
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:57,039
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

10
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,758
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

11
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,240
When you are putting your hands towards Me,

12
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:13,546
then the Divine love passes through
your fingers,

13
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:20,897
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

14
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:28,810
and informs Shri Ganesha about My presence;

15
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:33,232
and then the Kundalini rises.

16
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:53,050
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of Divine work,

17
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:59,305
where I came to Australia.

18
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,271
They asked Me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?

19
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:13,578
Did God visit Australia in human form?”

20
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,228
I said, “It’s not easy to reach
Shri Ganesha!

21
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:26,924
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not
reach Shri Ganesha.”

22
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:33,706
And you know that He is placed like a lotus

23
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:56,844
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

24
00:07:57,707 --> 00:08:07,717
Here He really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

25
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,941
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

26
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:17,107
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

27
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:25,024
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

28
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:31,021
Just it means this is the work of Shri
Ganesh.

29
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:35,968
He has borne you on this great chakra,

30
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:42,831
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha also cannot
enter into,

31
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:49,258
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

32
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,933
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

33
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:59,819
Such a glorious domain is [put upon this
place - unclear]

34
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,183
and is such a blessing,

35
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:09,072
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

36
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:27,261
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts
within us.

37
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,784
It’s very important to recognise Him,
to understand Him and to imbibe,

38
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:43,473
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

39
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:49,734
living in this place, so close to Him.

40
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:57,196
And though He is the giver of wisdom,

41
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:04,051
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

42
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:09,970
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

43
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:16,309
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

44
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,718
by which we realise that we are inclined

45
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,825
to the left or to the right.

46
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:35,577
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

47
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:40,409
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

48
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,488
Not only [that], but you should know
that it is so much

49
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:55,616
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum
so close to it.

50
00:10:55,817 --> 00:11:02,293
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated,

51
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:09,131
there’s no integration. You can be ruined,
completely.

52
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:19,181
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

53
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:26,273
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha
within you.

54
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:37,801
For example, we go to extremes: extreme
behaviour.

55
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:46,389
I will give you a very simple example:
I was going to Hong Kong

56
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,724
and the lady who organised it, telephoned
to Me again and again,

57
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:58,998
and she told Me that, “A big bunch
of people are coming to see You.

58
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:07,054
And You are going to be on the television
for the whole of two nights,

59
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:09,545
and this is going to happen and that
is going to happen”.

60
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:14,812
And she was spending so much money,
everything, describing the scene;

61
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:19,740
that I’ll be “the hot news” and all sorts
of things, you see,

62
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:23,354
like that she was talking about with Me
[unclear].

63
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:31,028
And she was on and on and on. And also,
she told Dr Warren.

64
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:36,482
Except for giving the newspaper she didn’t
want to pay for.

65
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,152
It was going too far.

66
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:51,272
At that juncture, I told her that it was
not necessary

67
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:56,822
to go to such a limit and plan it out:
that there would be people coming

68
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:01,375
inside the aeroplane just to receive Me:
makes no difference to Me!

69
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:06,001
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive Me.

70
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:13,907
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where at every point!

71
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,299
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

72
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,764
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be
a fizzled out thing this time.”

73
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:34,935
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!
There was no way – six hours.

74
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:38,255
And we had to take another plane

75
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:46,486
in which nobody came in, no car, nothing.

76
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:50,392
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

77
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:55,434
Telephoned to this hotel, they said,
“No arrangements thrown.”

78
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:00,425
Warren thought, “Mother has gone
to another extreme now”.

79
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:09,545
Quite worried that there was no one
to receive us at the airport now.

80
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:12,144
It’s all a joke.

81
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:17,871
Going to extremes has to be corrected
in you as well, you see,

82
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:21,750
because if you get successful with your
this kind of planning,

83
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,667
then you’ll go on doing this kind
of artificial planning

84
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:27,927
and not the planning of the Divine.

85
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:33,816
The Divine has its own plans and we have
to feel the plans of the Divine.

86
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:38,671
It works it out. You are just an instrument
to work it out.

87
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,565
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

88
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:53,002
then who is going to suggest you
the balance is Shri Ganesh.

89
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:57,473
And that balance, once it’s established
in you,

90
00:14:57,674 --> 00:15:03,977
you know how you should balance yourselves
and how there is no alternative

91
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:10,006
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative; one must
know.

92
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:13,757
Everything that is living has
no alternatives.

93
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:22,466
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

94
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:28,194
There’s no alternative. Whatever is there,
it has to see and enjoy;

95
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,233
but not to force its way on it.

96
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,871
This is one of the things we have to
understand

97
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:38,927
to establish our wisdom.

98
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:49,995
Because of our concept, our idea,
our anything,

99
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:58,448
even about God for example, about
our achievements itself,

100
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,535
can be absolutely wrong if we have
no wisdom.

101
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:12,554
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

102
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:16,951
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

103
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:23,558
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

104
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,180
It grows as much as it can, slowly,
steadily,

105
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:35,484
in coordination with nature it is.

106
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:46,136
Like that, the wisdom is the one
that understands.

107
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:51,319
It is an establishment and a state
of mind, you see.

108
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:57,717
We can reach the state of being, when
you become wisdom.

109
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:07,167
Such a wisdom outside is also expressed
so beautifully.

110
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:13,833
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman
and a gentlelady

111
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:24,278
only in a personality which is settled
down.

112
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:29,062
If you are frustrated with a certain
problem,

113
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:32,755
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed,

114
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:42,324
any extreme will not allow this flower
of wisdom to grow.

115
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:45,310
So even in frustration you have to look
back,

116
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:48,091
you have to stand back and see
for yourself,

117
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,245
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

118
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:58,060
Count your blessings one by one, count
your blessings one by one.

119
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:04,474
I’ll say again, count your blessings
one by one.

120
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,556
Once you start counting your blessings,

121
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:13,060
you will find in such a short time, where
are you.

122
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,671
Now the extreme projections of the mind
can take you to:

123
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:24,071
“I’m not going to face!”; although you
would like to do it.

124
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:38,062
But in wise projection, you can see this,
that you are what you have to be.

125
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:41,577
You are saints.

126
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:46,051
You were born to be saints in this great
country.

127
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,628
You are specially blessed people
in the heavens,

128
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:59,230
and are sent on this Earth to do this
Maha Yoga, to spread it.

129
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,913
You have achieved that state.

130
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:07,264
And if you are saints, you should not be
bothered as to a few things like,

131
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:12,340
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that;

132
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,462
which you have never been very much
bothered.

133
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:21,210
Can you see that? Any kind of extreme
behaviour.

134
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,695
For example, for materialism you people
are not so bad,

135
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:32,645
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

136
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:38,122
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path – wisdom;

137
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:43,917
logically, it has to be logical: what do we
possess in this world?

138
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,641
Just think of one thing that we can
possess.

139
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:57,552
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t
possess anything.

140
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:03,110
Except for your evolutionary development,
you don’t possess anything.

141
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:06,280
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be
born a saint always –

142
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:11,010
this is what you possess. The rest
you don’t possess.

143
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:17,098
It’s logical, logical. You need not to be
realised to understand what I am saying.

144
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,959
So why should people here worry about
their possessions?

145
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,065
When you leave this worry, this is another
wisdom,

146
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:35,716
this is a higher wisdom, which you are
developing within yourself.

147
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:40,700
And if we leave our possessions, our
material problems are solved.

148
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:44,659
This does not mean you throw them
in the sea, but the attachment to that.

149
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:51,737
Then it is solved, already solved within
yourself.

150
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:58,539
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques,
she did not throw them away.

151
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,017
Suddenly one man bumped into her.
I was with her. He said,

152
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,429
“Imagine, I never knew I was going
to meet you!

153
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,359
When I went to a particular cashier or
somewhere he said,

154
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,743
‘Do you know this lady? I’ve got her
travellers’ cheques with me.’

155
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:18,821
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

156
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:22,150
How the news has been organised,
in the nature you see,

157
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:28,553
when the flowers bloom, how these bees
come all the way.

158
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:36,063
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia
to Australia?

159
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:42,961
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them,
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth

160
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:48,529
which tells them, “This is the way you
have to go.”

161
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:56,092
So we have to see to this magnetism
within us:

162
00:21:56,293 --> 00:22:00,143
what makes us magnetic

163
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:07,182
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have,

164
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:09,629
but what naturally we have achieved within

165
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,826
and we are not afraid to express.

166
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:18,126
In fear you are never aggressive,

167
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:28,793
but even in fearlessness you are never
aggressive.

168
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:35,473
In fear you might say that you are not
afraid,

169
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:39,476
but you could be aggressive.

170
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:46,123
When people look very frightened, if you
push them

171
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:51,911
to the extreme of right, they can
come back.

172
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:58,526
But if you are fearless, you are innocent,
you are just standing there, watching.

173
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:07,934
Fearlessness never means aggression.

174
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:13,817
So the confusion of our concepts

175
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:19,735
can only be cleared out if there is light
within us.

176
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:25,455
For us, if somebody is aggressing us,
then we think

177
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:29,185
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened of them,

178
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:36,437
there’s no vengeance, then we are weakest,
we are weak, we are weak people,

179
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:44,538
so we should fight back. Even when you are
fighting back, you are weak people.

180
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:50,665
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

181
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:55,645
In fearlessness you become the witness.

182
00:23:55,846 --> 00:24:01,942
You see the joke, joke behind all this
extreme behaviour of another person.

183
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:06,260
And also you know the technique,
kaushalam.

184
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:11,276
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means
technique: how to manage the show

185
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:21,041
by which his action doesn’t trouble you;
if you want to.

186
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:25,864
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

187
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:30,633
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

188
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:34,635
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

189
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:39,581
It was a wise decision,

190
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:44,788
because if you have to prove that life is
eternal,

191
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:48,432
the best thing is to die and show.

192
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:53,198
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that He was not dead.

193
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:57,058
Still there are many people who are saying
[that] He was not dead.

194
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,714
Still there are people who are talking
this: “He was not dead.

195
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:04,963
He was alive. So He got out of the place.”

196
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:09,497
Because they don’t know how to explain.

197
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:16,139
So He had to die publicly

198
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,125
and then His resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

199
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:31,801
This drama had to be performed

200
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:39,556
for you to have the wisdom to know
that life is eternal.

201
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:45,467
It doesn’t mean that He was weak,
by any chance.

202
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:58,482
So the idea of our aggression, or our
suppression, both come

203
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:15,141
from either fear or some sort of a satanic
pleasure to oppress others.

204
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:21,817
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also.

205
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:25,115
See how wisdom is so important.

206
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:30,588
Throughout if you find, in every chakra
resides pranava –

207
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,536
is the life of every chakra.

208
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:39,445
Because it is the wisdom that tells you
whether you are in a chakra or not.

209
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:44,532
So how wisdom is [so] important that you
even become a sakshi

210
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,994
if you have wisdom, otherwise you cannot.
You become a witness only

211
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:57,439
when you have that focal point adjusted
to your centre of gravity.

212
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:03,390
That is wisdom.

213
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:07,267
When people tell Me about somebody
who has harmed them,

214
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:12,301
they paint such a dark picture of the whole
thing,

215
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:19,298
as if it was the another war that was
fought.

216
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,127
Then you go and listen to another side,

217
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:28,725
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

218
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:34,407
Between these two pictures you stand.

219
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:40,111
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

220
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:50,192
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, that to this.

221
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,359
How do you end it up?

222
00:27:57,126 --> 00:28:05,602
Only by your wisdom, by understanding
it’s an illusion.

223
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:10,012
The main thing is the mirror on which
it is reflected,

224
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:16,550
is just an illusion that is appearing, and
we are worried about it.

225
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:21,088
The whole illusion will drop out as soon
as you just see the mirror

226
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:25,302
and don’t worry about the reflections.

227
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:33,217
They’ll come and go: it is for you just
to witness it, that’s all.

228
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:38,041
It's not - the mirror is a mirror, which is
a solid thing,

229
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:42,364
and all the reflections are illusions.

230
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:53,568
That's how we miss all the sweetness
of our own being.

231
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,438
Wisdom lies in understanding that you
are the Spirit.

232
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:10,332
You are not all these illusions, you are
the Spirit, you are the Spirit.

233
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:15,441
The attention was, as animals, was on food
only, you can say.

234
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,592
You were aware of food, nothing else
but food.

235
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,396
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

236
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:26,833
than you feel - came up to a point where
he started thinking that he is

237
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:31,254
the prime minister or he is an actor
or an actress

238
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:35,077
and this and that, and all sorts of
so-called they have achieved.

239
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,885
Or maybe they start thinking, “Oh, they are
atheists,

240
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:49,034
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see,
communists and socialists.”

241
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:03,699
It’s a drama going on all the time. They
are wearing wigs after wigs, you see.

242
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,807
If they like this wig they’ll wear this,
otherwise they’ll throw away.

243
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:09,866
This has killed the romance completely!

244
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:14,522
You start loving the wigs of a person!

245
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:24,916
And wigs can be bought, they could be
exchanged.

246
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:30,745
You go into the market, you can get, say,
about ten types of wigs.

247
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:36,895
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour
for the hair,”

248
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:41,711
so the lady will go and wear that and
come out,

249
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:45,686
and then you'll like her for the wig
that she has got.

250
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:50,477
Then another may wear the same.

251
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:58,561
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one
wig,

252
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:01,143
could bore you completely.

253
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:09,877
Because there’s no living dynamism,
that charisma.

254
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:15,788
Every moment is so beautiful. It breaks
into new waves

255
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:20,015
of such beautiful colours and beautiful
music.

256
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:26,259
That is all lost with these bought images.

257
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,979
Every minute the image changes, with
a living personality,

258
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,753
into tremendous beauty. But the first point
is the wisdom

259
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:38,680
to know that our images cannot be purchased

260
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:45,515
or bought or created or made: they evolve.

261
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:50,123
So we have to only see to our evolving
force:

262
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:53,152
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

263
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:59,834
Are we moving with our evolving force
or getting ourselves

264
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:10,071
crucified with all these artificial
misidentifications that says that,

265
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:14,690
“You are this, you are that, you are...”?
You are nothing but a seeker.

266
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,375
It's a category, I have told many- a-times,
that you are a seeker

267
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:23,353
and you have to seek. Now, what do you
seek? Is your Spirit.

268
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:27,689
And once you have found it, establish
yourself on that. That’s what you are!

269
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:34,161
And to know that you are that Spirit itself
is so satisfying;

270
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:41,781
is itself emitting wisdom in you which is
so joy giving,

271
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:46,781
and is nothing but love. It’s love,
I tell you.

272
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:49,347
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

273
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:56,980
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

274
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:04,577
To Me it is nothing but silence,
everything stops at that point.

275
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:09,559
Just feel it within yourself; where
the wisdom becomes love,

276
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,963
and love becomes wisdom, that’s
the real integration of life.

277
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:22,802
Open your hearts, allow Shri Ganesha

278
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:29,086
to be settled in that, that innocence
which enhances everything.

279
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:33,131
Look at the little ones, how they came
forward to give Me flowers:

280
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:38,580
every step, every movement was so joyous,

281
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:43,283
was creating such a beautiful, delicate
ripple in My heart.

282
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:47,932
And it’s written as history for Me,

283
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:54,999
to see these little, little sweet, innocent
Ganeshas coming forward.

284
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:59,770
And the wisdom becomes so powerful,

285
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:04,488
that you know the source of love
as Ganesha in you.

286
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:11,674
For Him, He did not know anybody else but
one: that which is the source of love.

287
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,672
Never questioned, never argued:
no alternatives.

288
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:28,809
No new ideas came to His mind,
just taking in.

289
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,620
Working it out within yourself and
the whole thing just works out.

290
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:40,620
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

291
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:44,047
into the Kingdom of God where He looks
after everything.

292
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,914
You want a house? All right, have it!
What do you want?

293
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:51,027
You want that? All right, have it. You have
a problem? Have it.

294
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:55,320
It’s all God’s, the whole thing. Who owns
it but God?

295
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:59,818
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

296
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:03,519
And He wants you to enjoy everything.

297
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,642
Only through the power of wisdom that
you can achieve Me.

298
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:19,196
Today, though I have to show a path
of that achievement in your wisdom

299
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:25,273
in which there is no artificial thing;
it’s so natural.

300
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:31,500
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

301
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:35,558
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

302
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,618
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

303
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:43,900
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

304
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:49,445
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

305
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:53,704
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

306
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:57,756
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

307
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:01,401
Not by any rule of any kind, or anything

308
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:04,201
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and,
“You do this!”

309
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:09,769
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

310
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:21,195
Even in the hand if you see: this portion
is Australia.

311
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:27,672
Now just see: this portion is the source
for all the fingers,,

312
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:35,623
it is the connecting point, is this point.
But it doesn’t say anything.

313
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:39,328
For example, this finger means something,
this thumb means something,

314
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,977
this finger means something, this means
something,

315
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:47,098
but this [base] doesn’t say anything,
doesn’t do anything.

316
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:50,295
But without this nothing exists.

317
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:55,813
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

318
00:36:56,014 --> 00:37:05,356
This is the connecting link with the Divine
and the guiding link.

319
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:10,397
This only tells which finger to move, where
to take, how to contract, which muscle.

320
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:16,580
All the muscles [are] controlled in this
portion.

321
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,796
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

322
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:33,879
through the awakening of Ganesha in My
children, Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

323
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,345
And the whole world is going to get
the blessings coming from Shri Ganesh.

324
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:49,024
[…] You know that Kundalini is in India
and only there the Kundalini can rise.

325
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:57,538
But one thing you have to remember,

326
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:04,835
that you are really placed at a very
pivotal point

327
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:09,972
and that the responsibility is too much
on you.

328
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:17,765
The responsibility is to keep the whole
atmosphere pure

329
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:21,960
and send forth all the fragrance
of the lotus.

330
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:28,626
Though maybe you will feel you are
surrounded by only mud and everything,

331
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:34,932
but still you have to be very strong
lotuses.

332
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:40,437
For the whole world you have to come up

333
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:45,890
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

334
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:52,707
of announcement that the Blossom Time
has come.

335
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:58,880
I was asking for the river’s name, what’s
the name of the river.

336
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:05,497
I wonder if you thought about it. See,
the river’s name is Parramatta.

337
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:10,850
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’,
should be, Parra.

338
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:19,819
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’. Your
river’s name itself is Parramatta.

339
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,502
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

340
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:30,724
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti
Her[self], only, had to be here

341
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,937
to bless the Ganesha all the time which
has to work hard.

342
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:42,513
He’s the one who sorts out, the Lambodara.

343
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:50,515
The one you see in the Sistine Chapel,
very well pointed out,

344
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:56,421
the huge big stomach. It’s really
an Australian character, personality,

345
00:39:56,622 --> 00:40:03,879
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

346
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,034
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

347
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:12,988
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. You can see it perfectly -

348
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:16,287
it's Australian character.

349
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:22,776
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

350
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:27,170
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see
that so clearly,

351
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:32,421
that He had to be Australian like that.

352
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:46,193
It was so beautiful to come down,
so beautiful.

353
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:58,260
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for Me is
nothing but complete joy, complete joy.

354
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:10,547
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years' time;

355
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:15,121
I will just settle down because the saintly
person is not supposed

356
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:17,744
to move from places to places, they must
settle down,

357
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:22,708
they must have their own round pillow
or seat - that’s called as takiya,

358
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:30,667
and you are not to leave that. But I am
your Mother - hm, great - moving all over.

359
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:36,779
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

360
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:45,760
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

361
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:50,851
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

362
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:54,551
May God bless you all.

363
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:24,453
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
