Indistinct voices of children

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,720
Sahaja Children: questioning Shri Mataji [Marathi?]

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,830
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

9
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:00,640
Her blue sweater, just find out from Olympia's
Mother.

10
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:13,390
…. [to the child] please sit there.

11
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:24,700
Child: Did Olympia's mother come?

12
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,490
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

13
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:48,450
Today is the combination of Shri Krishna,
this one (is) his face and this is his dress.

14
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:58,110
Ah, I think someone should go and find out
from...

15
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,470
Joan [Mother calls a Yogi].

16
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:20,140
Her sweater, her sweater is with … she said
she has given to Olympia her blue sweater.

17
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,450
Light blue

18
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:35,910
Child: Light blue

19
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:56,890
Shri Mataji: What are the words, Vishnu's
names, in English.

20
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:06,430
Better take it in English, better.

21
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:15,970
(Mother talks to a baby-child [Marathi?].

22
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,330
Ah, better take her.

23
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,460
Take the names.

24
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,720
In English they are easy to take I think.

25
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:43,880
Only the first, one should take them.

26
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:55,319
Ah, does somebody has a shawl, [Marathi?]

27
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:04,800
Ne, it's alright.

28
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:20,820
Actually we should have Rasaali (?) playing
with that, it would be nice, it doesn't matter.

29
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,159
These are the names of Vishnu, because Vishnu
only achieved the status of Shri Krishna who

30
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:34,319
in his own life time expresses his complete
form of Virata.

31
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,699
Complete form of Virata.

32
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:48,770
And this is a very good understanding, if
you know that you are also, start the dharma,

33
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:54,990
establish your Dharma and then you become
a witness, and then you become part and parcel

34
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,220
of the whole, the Virata.

35
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,409
The same pattern takes place in you also,
in the evolutionary process.

36
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,800
Now lets have (the names).

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,869
But, it's the meaning, that's better.

[speaking to Shri Mataji, not clear: Hundreds

384
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,860
Shri Mataji: what's the time?

385
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:05,220
… so it's the time of his birth has come
now, even according to Hindu timing and...

386
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
(?) all the badas and everything.

387
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:15,970
It will take sometime and put the whole thing
now, mix it up and put it the whole thing.

388
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:26,670
Have you finished with the … lets put these
things, what ever is there, one person should

hold it together in the hand and put the all
thing inside, in the hand should be taken.

390
00:27:40,900 --> 00:28:05,870
(silence) Next time you should do (with the
English ?) names like that, it's better, they

391
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,870

have the meanings and you will know what means.

395
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:30,090

to do it with understanding, that is very
important.

Yogi: judging others

476
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,020
Shri Mataji: who says that?

Yogis: Om Swaha

483
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:21,320
Shri Mataji: You are all part and parcel of
yourself, and if something is wrong is better

484
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,280
you judge yourself, that's the best part.

485
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:33,990
How much do you love, how much do you respect,
discipline, of Sahaja Yoga.

486
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:49,470
You have to sacrifice something for Sahaja
Yogis, is it?

487
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:55,630
Lets count how many things have you sacrificed
so far for Sahaja Yoga.

488
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,810
You have gained a lot, but you have to sacrifice.

489
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:13,920
How much have you sacrificed for sahaja yoga,
you cant even sacrifice little comfort.

490
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,960
All badas against sacrifice.

491
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,020
Yogis: Om Swaha

492
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,400
Shri Mataji: All badas against forbearing

493
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,590
Yogis: Om Swaha

494
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,000
Shri Mataji: All badas against wisdom

495
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,170
Yogis: Om Swaha

496
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:39,670
Shri Mataji: (? loving each other when there
is no ?) All badas against that

497
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,970
Yogis: Om Swaha

498
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:48,010
Shri Mataji: All badas against teasing your
Mother

499
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,390
Yogis: Om Swaha

500
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:56,760
Shri Mataji: I just want you to love each
other, that's all.

501
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,270
Nothing else

502
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:03,060
Yogi: all badas against resentment and jealousy

503
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:09,390
Yogis: Om Swaha

504
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,870
Yogi: All badas of (?)

505
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,050
Yogis: Om Swaha

506
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:24,080
Shri Mataji: and also those who are organizing
should not be dominating.

507
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,920
They should be understanding and should know
they must respect the freedom of everyone.

508
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,109
It should be mutual, it should be no something
with a rod.

509
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:39,480
Sahaja Yoga cannot be done through a rod,
but if someone is trying that, you better

510
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
accept it for the time being.

511
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,810
Is not good for the person who is trying such
thing, to be using the rod all the time.

512
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,690
Try to have a reasonable attitude for everything,
reasonable, there is nothing to fight, there

513
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,400
is nothing to quarrel, there is nothing to
ahh... think that somebody is more dear to

514
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,940
me and somebody is not.

515
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,750
You see, those who look dear maybe they are
not.

516
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,400
So don't do all that.

517
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,550
Just try to be kind to each other, try to
understand, try to help, try to guide, somebody

518
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,850
has some weaknesses, all right, try to help
that person.

519
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,099
If somebody has weaknesses, you should not
capitalize all that.

520
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,820
It should be worthy, but I can see (?) is
coming now.

521
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,080
So I don't want miss the moment, I can feel
it, that's coming, no doubt.

522
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:33,260
Some how I have a feeling now, and I have
seldom (felt ?) in my feelings.

523
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:41,930
So some golden (age ?) I can see (along the
lines ?). I am sure something great is going

524
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,930
to happen.

525
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,210
May God bless you for this day.

526
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:52,711
It was a great day and the birth of Shri Krishna,
should be within us, within ourselves, so

527
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:58,270
our Vishuddi should be all right balanced
witnessing and control our ego and superego

528
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:07,080
in such a manner that the Kundalini is kept
above on to a higher level, attention on to

529
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,780
a higher level.

530
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,580
I think from today I'll stop calling you anymore.

531
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:19,360
And I have a feeling now we have to go very
fast, and once we have started very fast,

532
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:40,960
then you will have to run fast then you will
have no time to quarrel.

533
00:39:40,960 --> 00:40:00,580
May God bless you

534
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:44,710
Yogi: Om Shri (Radanna Pratini) Nirmala Devi
Ki Jai

535
00:40:44,710 --> 00:41:04,349
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.

536
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:07,480
Thank you very much for celebrating this birthday
of mine.

537
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,380
Thank you very much.

538
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,810
Yogi: Thank you for coming on this Earth

539
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:24,410
Shri Mataji: You see, according to Indian
(?), they count even the first day of birth,

540
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,761
like if you have to say how many years you
have, according to them I am already 60 and

541
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:44,940
I am going to be 61 and after 61 you can take
sanyasa, so it's a big freedom.

542
00:41:44,940 --> 00:42:02,920
Thank you very much to all

543
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:11,910
Yogis: thank you
