1
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,672
Yesterday I told you

2
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:24,830
how 'Self' is more important

3
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,925
than anything else

4
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,715
at the present state of human awareness

5
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:33,257
When you are at the human awareness

6
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:35,337
first thing that should happen to you

7
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:38,297
is to feel your 'Self'.

8
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,211
As Shri Krishna has said,

9
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:43,211
"Atmane atmane thushtaha."

10
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:47,110
Unless and until you reach your Atma, your Spirit,

11
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,400
you are not going to get the satisfaction

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,930
of achieving anything.

13
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:58,698
Because Kundalini, which you see here

14
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:04,368
seated in the triangular bone

15
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:09,668
which we call as the sacrum

16
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,178
that means, Greek knew about it.

17
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,402
Greek knew about the sacrum bone.

18
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:20,172
Otherwise they would not have called it as sacrum, means sacred.

19
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,409
Even when I went to Athens I was surprised

20
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,819
that Athena, the word 'Atha' comes from Sanskrit,

21
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:30,999
means primordial. And she had a snake like thing

22
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,799
in Her hand with all the chakras.

23
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,165
So the Greeks knew about it.

24
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,536
And when I talked to them

25
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:40,367
they told Me, that it is a fact.

26
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,527
that Indians came much before Alexander.

27
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:44,887
We had a rapport with Indians

28
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:46,832
much before Alexander

29
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,073
and they told us about the Primordial Mother

30
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,749
and Her three powers.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,743
It is very amazing how they knew all about it.

32
00:01:54,746 --> 00:02:01,896
And then it all got lost because of the extroversion,

33
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:09,102
a moving out from reality.

34
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,591
So this bone, sacrum bone contains

35
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:21,161
or here resides the Kundalini in three and a half coil

36
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:25,870
This is the power of our pure desire.

37
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:30,569
The pure desire is the desire, when it is manifested

38
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,280
should give you full satisfaction.

39
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,130
For example, some people seek it in power.

40
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:38,753
They indulge in power.

41
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,713
Some seek it in possessions.

42
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:44,019
Some seek it in other things.

43
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:49,389
But all these seekings do not give them satisfaction

44
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,357
If they could give satisfaction

45
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:57,587
then there would have been no problem.

46
00:02:57,564 --> 00:03:01,612
Because once you buy a car then you want to buy something else

47
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:04,109
and then you buy…want to buy something else.

48
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,282
You start moving from one to another and as Economics says

49
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,401
that in particular a want is satiable

50
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,318
but not in general.

51
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,339
So we have to understand, that the wants

52
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:17,489
that we have, the desires we have,

53
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:21,335
are not pure desires, but are impure desires

54
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,229
and when we deal with them,

55
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,448
we never get that satisfaction.

56
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:28,474
For example somebody wants to do something

57
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:31,738
he does it but doesn’t get any satisfaction out of it.

58
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:34,462
The only way you can get satisfaction is

59
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:38,542
that you become one with the Divine.

60
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:43,414
And this power of desire which is a pure desire is

61
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:47,134
residing in each and everybody’s triangular bone.

62
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:48,614
But we are lost.

63
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,114
We are seeking our pleasures,

64
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,671
our joys into wrong things

65
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:57,123
We think that by doing this or by doing that,

66
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:59,623
by buying this or becoming that

67
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:02,600
we will be completely, fully satisfied,

68
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:05,096
which we ultimately discover.

69
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,036
In a evolutionary stage

70
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:09,220
such people when they discover

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,720
that the joy is not in all these things;

72
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,446
there is no happiness in this kind of thing;

73
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,030
we have to go beyond this.

74
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:18,300
Once they discover this then they become

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,450
a special category of people.

76
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,950
And these special categories of people

77
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,670
are the seekers.

78
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,900
Of course today I find so many seekers are lost.

79
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,395
Especially in America they are lost in various ways.

80
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,930
We would say in all the cults,

81
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:39,504
or in all other things like drugs, or homosexuality

82
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:42,658
or whatever you may call it, they are lost into these.

83
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,668
Into violence, many are indulging into violence.

84
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,396
Or doing all kinds of things

85
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,396
which are not for their ascent,

86
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,816
but are degrading and will take them down

87
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:56,446
not to their seeking, but to their hell.

88
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:58,324
But it is happening today.

89
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,663
You can see it very clearly.

90
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:00,781
It is happening

91
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:04,671
because human beings do not understand

92
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:08,339
that human awareness is a transitory phase,

93
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,361
you have to go beyond it.

94
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:13,121
And that beyond stage, the stage we have to reach

95
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,562
is the stage of your 'Self'.

96
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:16,832
To begin with

97
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,629
you have to become first of all 'Self Realised'.

98
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,276
Meaning you are to be 'Born Again'.

99
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,823
And to be born again

100
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:27,993
you have to allow the Kundalini to work it out.

101
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,898
So what do we do as people said,

102
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,608
I told you yesterday, it is effortless.

103
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,806
It is without any money.

104
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,811
It just happens spontaneously.

105
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:40,156
Now it happens that

106
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,116
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

107
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,876
In the same way

108
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,556
I may be able to enlighten you

109
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,766
but you can enlighten many others.

110
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,428
Like in India we have someone

111
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,338
who has enlightened 10,000 people.

112
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,388
and has done so much good to people,

113
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,368
that it is amazing.

114
00:05:57,368 --> 00:06:00,850
Even there are people like the President of India,

115
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:05,160
we can say the President of the High Court

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,207
Judge of the Hague High Court

117
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,537
which is the World High Court,

118
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,538
The president of that,

119
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,667
He's got his Realisation

120
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,267
and he's a Sahaja Yogi

121
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,606
So we have people of that calibre

122
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,096
who are Sahaja Yogis.

123
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:18,876
and who have felt the vibrations

124
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,416
who have become Self Realised.

125
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:24,366
But they are very humble people, extremely humble people.

126
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,441
Indians are basically humble and they know

127
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,671
who is a saint and who is not a saint.

128
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,994
They are so sensitive that they know

129
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,974
who is a saint and who is not a saint.

130
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:38,284
But in the West, as we have now lost our power

131
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:40,634
to feel the saintliness in a person

132
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,936
we do not know who is a saint, who is not a saint.

133
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:49,283
So the first thing that has to happen to you to understand who is a saint, who is not a saint,

134
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:52,878
is first to get your Realisation.

135
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:56,736
Without the spirit expressing itself

136
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,746
into your awareness, into your attention,

137
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,646
you cannot make out who is a saint, or who is not a saint.

138
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,566
Like they crucified Christ for no reason at all

139
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:10,533
and they worshipped Hitler.

140
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,503
The Jews, they refused to accept Christ,

141
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:16,783
they refused. They said, no we don’t accept Christ,

142
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,693
because Christ said that I am dying for your sins.

143
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:26,679
They said, no we don’t believe in that. We must suffer. So they suffered.

144
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:30,460
They had sufferings.  If you ask for suffering you’ll have sufferings.

145
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,852
But if they had accepted Christ

146
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,630
at least one thing would have happened

147
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,080
they would not have suffered.

148
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:41,473
They asked for suffering. They thought unless and until we suffer we cannot go to God.

149
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:44,591
This was a very wrong idea.  Because Christ himself was a Jew.

150
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,452
Himself He took birth among the Jews.

151
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,826
And it was the Jews He came to save.

152
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:54,116
But they are the ones who refused to accept Him,

153
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,742
because they were blinded. They didn't want to see the point.

154
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:02,229
In the same way it has happened in every century.

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
Anytime any incarnation came people did not want to accept.

156
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,739
Not in India, I would say. Indians are much more sensitive to spirituality,

157
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,724
because they are not so much materialistic.

158
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:19,609
They understand, because we have been for ages seeking and seeking from… traditionally

159
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:22,109
So we know what this seeking is.

160
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,744
What it means.  For Me it’s not difficult to talk to them about Kundalini.

161
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:27,829
There I start on a different level altogether,

162
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,309
because they know everything whatever I’m talking, they know already, what it is.

163
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,799
May be not in the cities where the people are westernised. But they know.

164
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,270
But for other people I have to start it from A to Z.

165
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:47,203
So this is the Kundalini. We have got it. Three and a half coils, and it has a mathematical calculation.

166
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:54,033
Now it’s only Indians and Buddhists from Indians I would say believe in the non-being.

167
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,963
They believe there’s a non-being; being and non-being.

168
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,473
What is that state of non-being?

169
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:06,484
When you become the non-being means when you go beyond your conditioning and ego then you become the non-being.

170
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:10,896
And once you become the non-being then nothing can touch you.

171
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:17,262
As I told you yesterday…who are standing in the water have fear of getting drowned in the water,

172
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:26,613
but if you go to the boat then you start seeing that the water is down below it is not going to touch you.

173
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:31,773
That state has to be achieved, is the non-being, is the fourth dimension within us.

174
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:36,013
This is called also in Sanskrit as Turya dasha.

175
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,516
Now you might say why in India, these people discovered all that.

176
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,126
See now the reason is India is a very ancient country.

177
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:48,375
And there we didn’t have these problems that you had to face when you came to America.

178
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:52,065
You had to face the nature to begin with. Our nature is very kind.

179
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:57,304
You can live under a tree, eat the fruits of the forest and can enjoy ourselves.

180
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:03,987
We don’t need much in that country to cover ourselves or to have any elaboration.

181
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:08,855
So the attention has been always inside to find out why are we here?

182
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,875
What are we doing here?  Are we wasting our life?

183
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,955
Are we doing any harm to ourselves or to others?

184
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:20,500
Is it alright to exist as human beings or is there anything beyond?

185
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:24,420
This search has been there for thousands and thousands of years.

186
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:27,311
And because of this seeking

187
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:30,459
 they have been able to reach, right conclusions

188
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,509
that there is this Kundalini within us.

189
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,092
And this Kundalini is to be awakened.

190
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,609
And if She is awakened

191
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:41,869
then you can become 'Self' very easily.

192
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,419
And this was the job I had to do.

193
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,919
For that I had to work very hard

194
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,719
for days together to understand

195
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:52,009
what was the problem with human beings,

196
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,739
the permutations and combinations

197
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,549
of problems that they had.

198
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,691
And somehow I managed it, I think.

199
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,616
Now en masse Realisation is possible.

200
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,651
Yesterday despite some people being mischievous

201
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:06,907
you did get Realisation.

202
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,307
This is God's work

203
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,587
and God's work will go on.

204
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,457
Whether some people come and trouble you,

205
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,494
makes no difference.

206
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,734
They are just like mosquitoes.

207
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:19,444
They come and go away, has no meaning at all.

208
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,944
Because you see God’s work is much greater

209
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,404
than what they think of themselves.

210
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,902
So it doesn't matter what happens

211
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,133
or what people say or talk.

212
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:30,793
The God's work will go on

213
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:32,857
But you must know it is a living work.

214
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,703
It's not a plastic thing.

215
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:37,203
You can produce thousands of plastic flowers

216
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,471
very easily,

217
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,982
but you cannot produce one single living flower.

218
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:45,742
So when this living force has to act it takes time.

219
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:48,282
And it will take time, gradually it will grow.

220
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,820
And you'll be surprised that

221
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,434
gradually it will grow so beautifully,

222
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,500
that suddenly you'll find

223
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:57,650
lots of people coming up and becoming.

224
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,720
Because in Sahaja Yoga

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,750
what you become is important.

226
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,385
It’s the actualisation.

227
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,795
It is not some certificate or some organisation

228
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,810
that you belong to some organisation

229
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,555
or there is some certificate.

230
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,045
But it is what you become.

231
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,545
Your becoming is important

232
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,373
If you cannot become something

233
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,633
the you are no good in Sahaja Yoga.

234
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:19,923
Many people who come to us

235
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:22,453
we find they improve a lot

236
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:24,608
and they become very great also.

237
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,238
But some people do not.

238
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,668
They just waste it.

239
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,164
Energy is all wasted whatever you try they do not.

240
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:32,664
Sometimes they are so conditioned

241
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,619
that we cannot improve them.

242
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,874
There we feel helpless about them

243
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:39,214
because they do not want to corporate also.

244
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,714
And also they have many pressures on them.

245
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:45,544
But 90% people go up very well

246
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:49,014
and they manifest whatever they have achieved

247
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:52,284
Now the main thing is to understand

248
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:55,514
that this mechanism exists with us.

249
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:58,004
This energy exists within us.

250
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:01,614
Now this is like a hypothesis for you.

251
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:04,243
You need not accept it. It’s a hypothesis

252
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,416
as one would put to a scientist.

253
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,909
But scientist must have an open…open mind.

254
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:10,399
They shouldn’t have a closed mind.

255
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,449
if you have a barrier

256
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,059
you cannot put anything before them.

257
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,559
If they are scientist they will have an open mind

258
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,499
to listen to My hypothesis.

259
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:22,779
And if it could be proved, if it could be proved

260
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,261
then you have to accept it.

261
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:26,502
If it is...  doesn't prove,

262
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,482
then you can say all right that's not proved so far.

263
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,312
All right!

264
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,799
So you have to wait and have patience with it.

265
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,992
 This is what it is in simple words

266
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,499
that I cannot be forced on you.

267
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:43,153
It cannot be humbled before you.

268
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,653
You have to ask for it.

269
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:48,473
Nobody can force you that you can become.

270
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,977
I cannot guarantee yesterday I said. It's a fact.

271
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,817
But still so many people got their realisation,

272
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,327
felt the cool breeze and felt the cool

273
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:57,407
breeze out of the head.

274
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,797
This you cannot do otherwise.

275
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,300
All other things you can do but this you cannot do,

276
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,838
is to take out cool breeze of your head

277
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,768
which is a factual thing and experienced.

278
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:10,488
But as I told you, that we live mentally

279
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:13,288
much more than we live with reality.

280
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,233
And mental projection can be anything

281
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,865
like a person who murders someone.

282
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,225
He has justification,

283
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,725
I murdered someone because of this and this,

284
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,179
but that justification

285
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,189
does not allow you to get out of law.

286
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,995
Does it? No.

287
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,495
You will be caught in the law. You cannot do it.

288
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:30,595
Whatever is wrong you are not supposed to do it?

289
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,225
But that is human law.

290
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,155
In the same way there is God’s laws.

291
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:36,574
And it you go against God's laws

292
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:37,544
then what happens

293
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,380
is that we are punished.

294
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,290
Now today I am going to tell you

295
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,820
about other awareness that one can have.

296
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,845
That one should know about.

297
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,859
I am talking about the super-consciousness

298
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:50,719
which is on top of our head.

299
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:53,041
But when the attention moves

300
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,071
to the left side too much

301
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:57,582
or to the right side too much

302
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,525
then also there could be a very, very big problem.

303
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,164
And the big problem can come because

304
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:10,544
we are not knowledgeable about it

305
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,044
We do not know. What is unknown

306
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:15,544
need not be Divine. Not at all.

307
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:18,474
Now when you start say

308
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:23,554
becoming extremely submissive,

309
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:29,883
slavish or you start following something vey blindly,

310
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:33,204
you start becoming fanatic about it.

311
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:34,834
Just without thinking

312
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,354
what you are doing is not right or wrong

313
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,864
you just follow something like that.

314
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,832
We call it the left side movement of the attention starts

315
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:47,961
where you start subduing yourself to something.

316
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,461
Subjecting yourself to something.

317
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,963
Accept the slavery of some ideas.

318
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:59,993
Accept the conditioning of some sort of theories.

319
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,693
Now once you start accepting such theories mentally

320
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,193
the attention starts moving towards the left side.

321
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:10,926
And also some people have a capacity to posses you like that.

322
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:13,906
They can posses you and can do like that, that you

323
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,806
lose your freedom and you become that kind of a person.

324
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:21,566
Then at that time what happens that you start moving

325
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,266
from your conscious mind to the subconscious mind

326
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,766
and then to the collective subconscious.

327
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:30,363
If you move to collective subconscious

328
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:32,353
then what happens to you.

329
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:34,473
If you move to the collective subconscious

330
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:40,883
then a person becomes possessed.

331
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:44,863
This possession comes to you through what we call

332
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:50,943
the protein 52 or protein 58 in medical terminology.

333
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,323
They say that if a person is vulnerable to cancer

334
00:16:55,323 --> 00:17:03,705
it is triggered by the presence or entrance of protein 52 or protein 58.

335
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:08,584
These are the names the doctors are given which trigger the disease

336
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:14,554
and once that happens then a person cannot get out of cancer

337
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:17,052
Because then the triggering starts

338
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:21,682
and he starts getting from bad to worse.

339
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:26,832
This 52 and 58, where do you find it?

340
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:34,527
According to doctors you find 52 and 58 in the area

341
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:39,242
which is built within us since our creation.

342
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,467
This area is placed within us

343
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,942
on the left-hand side, as you can see. Somebody can come and show.

344
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:47,514
On the left hand side this area is placed.

345
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:51,824
And this area one enters very easily.

346
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,184
Say you go on taking somebody’s name.

347
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:57,414
Now a days it is a fashion to give you a mantra.

348
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,901
Now start getting mantras, going on saying mantras, mantras, mantras.

349
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:04,901
Now what happens that you are not connected with the Divine.

350
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:08,071
And you start taking the name of some ‘x','y','z.’

351
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,805
So you are not connected

352
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,112
and you are just pressing hard your mind to get connected.

353
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,606
But it cannot because the Kundalini has not arisen

354
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,744
so you move to the left side.

355
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,644
And there you get caught up,

356
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:26,258
and that’s why you know in the cult people are so much mesmerised.

357
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:29,022
In every cult people get mesmerised

358
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,438
because they move to the left

359
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,548
for the domination of these gurus and things.

360
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:37,062
Because they want to make money out of them.

361
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:40,189
And then they cannot think of anything else.

362
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,389
They just think this is the right thing.

363
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,203
I was amazed that some of the cults

364
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,703
the gurus don’t know even Sanskrit language.

365
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,849
Some of them have come out of the jail

366
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,399
and they have become gurus

367
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,685
And they have give mantras which are so funny.

368
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:57,192
That somebody has been given mantra of Inga.

369
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,165
There is no word like Inga,

370
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:03,712
except for this word in a colloquial way is called inga

371
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:08,986
when a spider or something,

372
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:16,876
you can say, a scorpion has got the sting that is called as inga.

373
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:22,860
And this scorpion, when this scorpion hits it

374
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:26,060
to a person is called as the inga;

375
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,193
means that biting.

376
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,985
Now that’s the mantra given to many people, I was shocked

377
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:36,044
and it was told not to tell anyone about it.

378
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:38,557
So if you tell to anyone, he will just start laughing

379
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,429
and rolling with laughter.

380
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,927
Another mantra I heard was 'thinga';

381
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,787
meaning when you show someone like this is thinga.

382
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,457
In colloquial word, not in Sanskrit language!

383
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:51,607
There is nothing like a gerund ‘ing’ in Sanskrit language.

384
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,955
 It has no meaning.

385
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,456
And everything is meaningful in Sanskrit.

386
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:00,166
Even every syllable is meaningful.

387
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,499
 So such people have come over

388
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,459
and have become great gurus.

389
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,916
And they give you names.

390
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:09,896
May be the names of some proteins which exists

391
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:13,236
and which enter into you and you get possessed.

392
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:16,466
So this left-side movement is a very common thing.

393
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,872
And once you get to this left-side movement

394
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,492
you cannot get out of it.

395
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,469
It's very difficult,

396
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:24,629
so the people who have been to such people

397
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:27,834
or to such enticement

398
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:32,191
show immediately when they come to us for realisation

399
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,679
and that we don’t know how to deal with them.

400
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:35,879
Because if you tell them,

401
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:37,419
"You forget your guru." They don't like it.

402
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:42,984
They go on contortions, their bodies start getting into contortions.

403
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:45,071
They feel terrible. They cannot sit quiet.

404
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,741
They cannot move up.

405
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,246
But if you tell them that this was wrong,

406
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:52,636
they don’t want to accept because they are still carrying on with that idea.

407
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,296
And they don’t want to believe

408
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,466
that whatever they were carrying on was wrong.

409
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:58,136
That they have to ascend.

410
00:20:58,146 --> 00:21:01,256
Even when they ascend they take time.

411
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,743
This is one very big problem we face.

412
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:07,119
But as a result of the left side movement

413
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,829
you get most of the incurable diseases,

414
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:12,719
For example your AIDS disease that has come

415
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:17,280
is because of the combination of the left side Mooladhara Centre

416
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,099
and heart…is that…that’s the one.

417
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:26,399
Of course it has to have Swadisthana with it, left Swadisthan.

418
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,899
Is due to that.

419
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,283
If somebody could cure these three centres of that person,

420
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,796
that person can be cured.

421
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,693
Sclerosis comes from the same.

422
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:40,836
If somebody is suffering from multiple sclerosis, same problem

423
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:43,329
that it comes Mooladhara Chakra, Void

424
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:48,066
and also sometimes the Right Heart.

425
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:51,931
Sclerosis! Most of the muscular troubles go like that.

426
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,951
Then we have got cancer.

427
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,233
Cancer could be due to any chakra

428
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,801
which is on the left hand side.

429
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,031
Must be the combination of two chakras

430
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,051
on the left hand side

431
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:05,722
depending on where the trouble is.

432
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:10,742
But when the cancer trouble comes into the centre

433
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,602
then it starts ascending.

434
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:15,672
Then it starts moving and you get galloping cancer.

435
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,988
You can start going from one to another end

436
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,488
and it can finish off a person.

437
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:26,938
That's how you can just be finished with a galloping cancer.

438
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:30,028
Now when somebody is vulnerable like I would say

439
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,008
a person who is a very, very active person

440
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,508
who is very much under shock all the time,

441
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:40,020
is very, very active and hectic, supposing he is a…

442
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,250
getting up in the morning, reading newspaper

443
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,217
and getting up into his bath and then getting ready somehow or other

444
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:49,914
and getting into his car

445
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,624
and then going out in a very hectic manner

446
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:55,126
he lives under shock

447
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:59,476
because he is reading horrible news, then he is seeing a big jam on the street

448
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,386
and all this things are happening, he is so full of anxieties,

449
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:06,026
such a person is venerable to another thing called blood cancer.

450
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:11,766
But for that also the Left Nabhi, this centre, is attacked.

451
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,306
If Left Nabhi is attacked under these circumstances

452
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:19,297
such a person can get blood cancer.

453
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,617
Supposing your mother is like that, she's a very hectic person

454
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:29,570
and she is trying to sort of do many things at the same time

455
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,687
and she is of that nature then also the child can pick up trauma.

456
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:40,510
If a mother is a very extreme type of a person or has gone through shocks like that…

457
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:44,447
I have seen people who have gone through wars and have come out of problems.

458
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:49,669
Their children also are very prone to troubles of the brain.

459
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:53,259
And they also get it because of the left side movement.

460
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:59,655
But as you go upward, as the chakras come upward on the left hand side, say the Left Agnya is caught up

461
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:03,307
and Left Swadisthana is caught up, that means the person is completely possessed.

462
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:10,087
But with that if the Heart Chakra is caught up or with that if the Vishuddhi Chakra is caught up

463
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:13,687
then one can become mad and such people could be there

464
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:21,167
But they become mad, they become alright, then become mad, like that you go on and ultimately they end up as mad people.

465
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:28,724
But in Sahaja Yoga one can cure people who are mad but they have to be treated in a way.

466
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:36,736
Normally we do not take up any person who is a mad person in our yoga because it is very difficult to cure them and better them.

467
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:40,726
But if they want to work it out on themselves we say all right work it out this way.

468
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,293
Try if you can be alright

469
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:52,426
But there are many in between phases like schizophrenic you can call it, or some people who are imbalanced, who are nervous, all kinds of things are in between.

470
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:59,204
So absolutely mad even if you forget, but there are so many others who look sane, but inside they have problems.

471
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:08,607
All such people can be cured with Sahaja Yoga, if they act according to what we tell them and the way it is to be worked on.

472
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:14,437
Now in Sahaja Yoga the practices are extremely simple because it’s question of balance.

473
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:18,637
The left side catches…if the left side catches then you get all these problems.

474
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:24,963
But if you can balance it, if you can balance left side with the right side, the troubles can be all right.

475
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:36,820
For example, if you have got say a left side problem and you do some right side activity of ego development, you will be amazed that your cancer can be cured.

476
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,147
But then you go to the right side.

477
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:43,257
That means you become ego oriented. You become extremely ambitious.

478
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:46,327
You become futuristic. You start dominating others.

479
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,427
And this is what was practiced by Hitler.

480
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:54,631
He got this knowledge from Dalai Lama. He said it in his book that he got it from Dalai Lama

481
00:25:54,658 --> 00:26:01,990
How to control the minds of the people by which you dominate them and by domination what do you make out of them?

482
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,190
Devils!

483
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,086
And that’s what he did it,

484
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:08,616
because they become so ambitious, they become racist to begin with

485
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:15,486
They become racist. They think they are the best. They are the highest. They have the right to kill anybody they feel like.

486
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:19,536
They have the right to take revenge. They have a right to ill treat people

487
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,646
All kinds of funny ideas come into their heads, these right sided people.

488
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:27,536
And when they come into the right side they do not know what they are up to,

489
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:31,506
because once they develop the right side. then they have other troubles.

490
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:37,946
Like they might develop blood pressure, they might develop kidney troubles, they might develop heart trouble.

491
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:43,298
Heart in the sense, not angina and all not a lethargic heart, but overactive heart,

492
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:48,658
they can get a sudden, massive, heart attack and they may die with it.

493
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:53,101
So such people are also suffering from all kinds of liver trouble

494
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:54,968
 Like cirrhosis of the liver.

495
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:58,368
Liver…other liver troubles, skin troubles, skin problems,

496
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,059
all these come from the right side movement.

497
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,319
So when you start moving to the right side too much,

498
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,559
you can be possessed by people who are overactive.

499
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,059
Like a ego oriented person if he bcomes

500
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:12,999
friendly with another egoistical person

501
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:16,029
both of them combined together in such a manner

502
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,440
that they form a group of egoistical nature.

503
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,969
When they become egoistical

504
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:25,419
they try to dominate and a big group can form

505
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:32,203
a frantic, horrible, violent group which can try to kill.

506
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:35,923
In India we had one such group which was formed,

507
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,423
under the name of the Goddess they started it.

508
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,923
In India they all are called as Anand Marg.

509
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,345
Of course it is now banned.

510
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,605
The fellow is under supervision,

511
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:48,155
but still in America he has followers.

512
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,366
Surprisingly!

513
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,610
they were caught killing

514
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,206
some ambassadors and all that.

515
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,616
And the leader

516
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:57,896
had to go in the jail for days together.

517
00:27:57,882 --> 00:27:59,420
Everything happened but the followers,

518
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:00,860
because they are so possessed

519
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,852
with the idea that they are in charge

520
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:05,345
and they have to kill everyone and that they have

521
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,613
to become like Hitler.

522
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,713
Now you cannot stop it.

523
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:11,803
It’s very difficult, but you can

524
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,583
if you can raise their Kundalini

525
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,083
then they will understand this is not reality.

526
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,793
We are just doing something that is not reality.

527
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,299
Is not for our beneficiary…

528
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,506
beneficiary or…neither for anybody else.

529
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,033
It is such a dangerous thing

530
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,292
we are doing to ourselves.

531
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,792
It is not at all benevolent to ourselves

532
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:31,332
or to anybody else.

533
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,012
So the benevolence only comes

534
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,402
when you move upward.

535
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:40,694
The third we can say is the awareness of hell

536
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:43,066
where people are really devilish by nature

537
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:44,335
You cannot change them.

538
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:47,155
They are very devil.. devil like,

539
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:49,145
very possessive type,

540
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:52,185
extremely arrogant, aggressive,

541
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,352
and they are really devils incarnate

542
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:55,052
in human forms.

543
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:57,594
And such people have to go to hell,

544
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:59,412
because we call them as

545
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,959
the awareness of the hell.

546
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,879
They always think of destruction,

547
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:04,249
of destroying others,

548
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,989
of overpowering others

549
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:07,969
or of destroying themselves.

550
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,242
There are many bhoots you know

551
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:10,462
who destroyed themselves.

552
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,448
Just like that they killed themselves.

553
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:13,808
These are all the people

554
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,578
who are on the other side of the ascent.

555
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:20,388
So when you start rising higher and higher

556
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,030
due to these chakras,

557
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,298
and when the Kundalini rises

558
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,568
through all these chakras

559
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:29,438
and goes up beyond the Sahasrara,

560
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,280
as you call it the Brahmarandra, here,

561
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,130
you become a subtler being.

562
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,520
Like your human attention say, we can say is like cloth here

563
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,620
And now the Kundalini is pushing it upward,

564
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:39,680
upward, like that

565
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,180
So all your attention which is outside goes inside.

566
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,780
And when it pierces through from here,

567
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,700
this piercing makes the attention subtle

568
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:56,060
because the subtle that is around which you do not feel normally starts penetrating into it.

569
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,436
It starts covering your attention.

570
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,786
And that’s how we say now your attention is enlightened.

571
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:08,796
And now it is enlightened. Not just talk but it becomes enlightened with collective consciousness.

572
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:12,236
You become collectively conscious.

573
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:21,721
Then such people when they talk, when they talk have such a personality, such a knowledge.

574
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:24,412
They become knowledge. They have no problems.

575
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:28,286
They become knowledge because they become the absolute knowledge.

576
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:32,126
But it is for you to decide. What are you seeking in life?

577
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:35,898
What do you want in life?  What is your life worth?

578
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:42,766
If you want to cheapen your life, waste it for something very cheap and ordinary and useless then you can go ahead.

579
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:45,993
But if you think your life is important as a human being, it should be,

580
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:51,343
because you have become from amoeba to this stage as human being not to waste it.

581
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:55,896
Not to throw it away, uselessly, but to become the Spirit.

582
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,396
That is what you have come on this Earth for

583
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:01,218
and that's what should happen to you.

584
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:05,077
Now the main problem with human beings is

585
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,007
that there are barriers we have got.

586
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:12,161
To accept anything we have barriers. But there is nothing to be accepted.

587
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:16,117
In Sahaja yoga you need not accept anything what so ever but you should also not deny.

588
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:20,269
If you deny I cannot raise your Kundalini. I cannot.

589
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:24,809
You should allow your mind to be open to get realised.

590
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,807
Because one reason is there,

591
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,344
why you have to do that more,

592
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:30,716
because you do not know about Kundalini

593
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,516
People told Me they don’t even know what Self Realisation is.

594
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,597
Imagine in India when My grandchild was born

595
00:31:37,597 --> 00:31:42,547
we had our astrologer in My husband’s place,

596
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:45,397
about two thousand miles away

597
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:47,128
from where the child was born.

598
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:48,644
He sent a telegram saying that

599
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:51,301
this child has found her guru,

600
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,218
sadguru in the household.

601
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:55,718
It was such a great thing to find a sadguru

602
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:58,728
who will give realisation to the child.

603
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:01,238
To us it is the most important thing.

604
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:03,738
In a horoscope the first thing they’ll ask,

605
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:06,138
"Will, shall we get Self Realisation

606
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,448
in this life time or not?"

607
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:09,436
Then they will say, "All right,

608
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:11,008
this life left, time be mine.

609
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:13,527
May be next lifetime.” Then they’ll think, “Oh God,

610
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:17,907
we have to wait one life time more."

611
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:20,987
And all the action is surrounding that.

612
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:22,037
The whole behaviour

613
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,817
that you must try to check your attention.

614
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:27,917
Chitta nirodh, try to check your attention.

615
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:30,216
Wherever it wants to go just keep it out.

616
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:34,426
While here it is, “What’s wrong?" "So what?”

617
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,936
If you want you jump in the sea. "So what?"

618
00:32:36,936 --> 00:32:38,896
"Who are you to tell us?"

619
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:39,856
It is not that.

620
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:42,566
There it is, you must control your attention.

621
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,950
Control your attention! Keep the attention pure!

622
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:49,360
If your attention is not pure at the time of Realisation

623
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,860
there will be a problem

624
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,990
It is just a different attitude towards life in India.

625
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,483
If somebody is angry

626
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:59,033
here people always say. "I hate you."

627
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,170
I mean in India if a child says like that

628
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,670
he will have two slaps on the face.

629
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,428
Its regarded bad manners to

630
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,638
even to think like that, that you hate anyone

631
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:14,288
To hate anyone is a sign of degraded personality.

632
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,808
I mean it’s very common with Indian people.

633
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,968
Whatever you know of Indians are the people

634
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:19,888
who are uprooted,

635
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:21,478
who have come here to make dollars.

636
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,028
They are different people.

637
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:25,008
They are sort of sieved out.

638
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:27,098
But the people who are in India,

639
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,118
now we have here

640
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:31,168
at least 20% people who have been to India.

641
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:33,258
You can ask them.

642
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:38,935
To them generosity is a quality.

643
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,484
Righteousness is a quality.

644
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:43,838
Purity is a quality. Quietude is a quality.

645
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,958
Peaceful nature is a quality.

646
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:47,938
They do not boast of their angers

647
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:49,948
and they do not boast of their hatred at all.

648
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:53,227
I mean it is never, never, never done.

649
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,481
Even if somebody hates he will

650
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:58,551
not say that, "I hate you."

651
00:33:58,547 --> 00:34:00,287
I mean it took some time for Me

652
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,783
to even say this sentence to people

653
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:06,069
like it is something prohibited.

654
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:09,529
Because it's your tongue gets spoiled.

655
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:12,027
If your tongue is spoiled and is impure

656
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:16,637
then whatever you say becomes untruth.

657
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:19,127
Your tongue must be pure.

658
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:22,457
You should not say something which is not true.

659
00:34:22,457 --> 00:34:24,957
In the sense, true doesn't mean that

660
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,457
supposing somebody is a person,

661
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,943
who to your mind is not a good person.

662
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,894
You shouldn’t say that. Need not say that

663
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:35,394
you are not a good person. You just keep quiet.

664
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:36,253
Let him discover,

665
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:41,513
because if he is bad, he will suffer himself.

666
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,843
This is a common attitude.

667
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:45,283
I am not talking for Indians,

668
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,493
but I must say for Spiritual life,

669
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,653
one has to learn from them.

670
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,576
Some of them who were thugs

671
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:54,084
must have come here to loot you. That's a different point.

672
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,896
I mean I am sorry for that. I am sorry.

673
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,776
But I also blame you for your naiveness.

674
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:02,276
I came much before that. But I said

675
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,996
you are not to pay to anyone any money.

676
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:06,507
Nobody listened to Me. They didn't like me

677
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:08,857
at all, when I said that.

678
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,357
So you had to suffer.

679
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,086
I know it was wrong, but it happened.

680
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:17,482
Now at least people should realise

681
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:22,497
that purity can only be achieved

682
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:24,437
through Self Realisation.

683
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,767
Innocence can be awakened within you

684
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,027
on the first chakra.

685
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:31,887
On the first chakra you develop innocence.

686
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:34,942
In the second chakra you develop creativity.

687
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:36,832
I’ve known people who never used to sing

688
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,392
have started singing very well.

689
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:39,872
Who never used to create anything

690
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:42,672
have started creating beautiful paintings.

691
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:47,292
They have become great painters now, very well known painters, musicians.

692
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:56,479
Those who were never doing architecture have become great architects and who  have never done any interior decoration have achieved a lot.

693
00:35:56,479 --> 00:36:05,749
So, to say that we are very creative one must know that you have limited energy and for that you have to be connected to the mains.

694
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,249
So, all the time the energy is flowing into you.

695
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:14,849
Then on top of that is the third centre, which is the centre of your seeking.

696
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:19,669
So whatever you were seeking was not alright.

697
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:23,049
But you do get your material well being. No doubt.

698
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:29,322
You do get your material well being but up to a point where you feel absolutely satisfied about it.

699
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,823
You don’t need anything anymore.

700
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:39,003
You also get a great blessing of dignity and divinity.

701
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:44,483
You get a proper understanding of your being. You become like a king.

702
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:49,901
For a king what we call the emperor, he doesn’t need anything.

703
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:56,913
For example as you know I am born of a very rich family and it’s a royal family and My husband also is a very rich man.

704
00:36:56,912 --> 00:37:03,163
It’s alright, we live in a very great comfort no doubt. But I can sleep anywhere. I can sleep on the street,

705
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:05,663
I can live anywhere. I am not bothered where I live,

706
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:09,533
what I do, how I move. I have no problem.

707
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,543
Because if you are the emperor,

708
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:15,593
you don't ask for anything. Do you?

709
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:19,411
If you get the food, alright, if you don't, alright.

710
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:22,293
If you like some food, or don’t like food

711
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,783
somebody says, I have said, “I don’t know what I ate in the morning.

712
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,763
I don’t know what I am going to eat now.

713
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,270
I don’t know if I had my lunch or not.

714
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,210
If I've had, all right.

715
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,710
Otherwise you can do what you like.

716
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:35,197
It’s that simple. Your body becomes your slave.

717
00:37:35,197 --> 00:37:37,697
You can lie down anywhere you feel like.

718
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:39,447
You can do any amount of travelling.

719
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,847
You can do thousand and one things.

720
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:45,347
You become so dynamic.

721
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:49,066
That happens when your Lakshmi Tattwa is arisen.

722
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,566
There are four Lakshmi Tattwas within us.

723
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:53,636
The first is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

724
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:57,546
where you become a person very dignified

725
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:02,266
and endowed with material comforts.

726
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,786
But comfort which kill you is not there.

727
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:08,741
Comfort means you are materially no more bothered.

728
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:12,161
You get jobs. In London we have so many jobless people.

729
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:14,661
But in Sahaja yoga all those who are there,

730
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:17,593
all of them have got jobs.  All of them!

731
00:38:17,593 --> 00:38:20,771
It's difficult to find one person who hasn’t got the job.

732
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:24,171
Moreover it is compulsory in Sahaja yoga that those who stay in the ashram

733
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:26,161
must have some jobs.

734
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:28,675
We have tried to allow some people to come without that

735
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:32,081
but we had very bad experiences of such people.

736
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:35,871
So all those who are living on dole or some sort of a thing,

737
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:37,721
we don’t allow them to come in the ashram.

738
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:42,713
And you will be surprised that as soon as they join Sahaja Yoga they get jobs.

739
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,211
They get better and better jobs

740
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:49,181
because Krishna has said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

741
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:53,221
"When you get your yoga, your well being will be looked after."

742
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:55,741
He didn’t say, "Kshema yoga," he didn’t say

743
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:58,551
"I’ll look after your well being and then you go to yoga."

744
00:38:58,554 --> 00:39:01,671
No! First yoga. "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

745
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:04,171
"First you get the yoga and then the kshema will work out."

746
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:07,721
That’s what happens to you on the Nabhi Chakra,

747
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,171
which is very important. But Raja Lakshmi that is

748
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,221
you become like a king.

749
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,131
That you become Gruha Lakshmi or Gruhastha

750
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,186
means you become a house holder.

751
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,721
You become a good wife and a good husband.

752
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:24,166
You develop proper feelings for each other.

753
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,666
And you develop proper feelings for your children.

754
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,686
You improve your societies through that essence

755
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:35,516
if it is born in you that you understand the importance of a good family life.

756
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:39,546
And that automatically happens. You don’t have to tell anybody.

757
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:44,406
Just those people who hated each other after coming to Sahaja yoga

758
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:46,216
have started loving each other,

759
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,406
understanding and enjoying each other.

760
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,916
And married life in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous.

761
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:56,926
Ninety percent of married life is so great that people in America

762
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,426
where they divorce third year, every third year,

763
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,106
we have seen people are doing very well in the married life

764
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:05,404
even in America.

765
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:12,393
Even here the…you see this mental projection,

766
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:15,113
the wife is no good, the husband no good, all vanishes.

767
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,613
You become the Spirit. You start enjoying

768
00:40:17,613 --> 00:40:22,373
the deeper significance of marriage.

769
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:26,253
Then comes the fourth side of the Lakshmi Tattwa

770
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:31,521
Is the fourth side is the ascending side.

771
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,504
The people who have got more money are fed up

772
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:38,104
and now want to have something beyond.

773
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:43,094
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga, when you start moving

774
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:47,933
then you find that nothing but spiritual life gives you real joy

775
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:52,013
So you just don’t care for anything else but the spiritual life.

776
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:54,513
And what is the spiritual life of Sahaja Yoga is

777
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:55,963
that you become the light

778
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:57,775
and you give light to others.

779
00:40:57,766 --> 00:41:01,593
Selflessly, there is no selfish motive in it.

780
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,145
Just because you are the light,

781
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,302
you become the light,

782
00:41:04,284 --> 00:41:06,622
You don't see the light, you become the light.

783
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:10,382
And you give light to others and just do it selflessly,

784
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:12,232
without charging any money.

785
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,672
Without asking for anything

786
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:17,512
you just start giving what you have got.

787
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:20,662
Spontaneously without paying for it

788
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:24,882
You just do it in a way that is a saintly way.

789
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:28,130
Saints always spend their own money,

790
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,394
always have spent their own money

791
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,511
to give joy to others.

792
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:34,300
They have never taken money from anyone.

793
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:35,991
I mean I have not heard of any saint

794
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:38,467
who has built up big palaces

795
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,979
and big places and big organisation, never.

796
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,161
That's not a sign of a saint.

797
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:48,443
A saint just emits compassion

798
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:52,613
and this compassion doesn’t speak. It is silent.

799
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:55,303
This compassion acts.

800
00:41:55,302 --> 00:41:57,802
It doesn’t speak. It acts.

801
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:01,662
When it acts it works out wonders.

802
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,682
That's what you know when Christ

803
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:05,192
was touched by some lady

804
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:08,701
he said, "Some energy has flown through Me."

805
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:09,992
That is what it is.

806
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:12,489
That the energy starts flowing through you

807
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,020
and you do not do anything

808
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:15,710
just happens automatically.

809
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:18,191
Without doing anything you achieve it.

810
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:19,581
So for today

811
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:22,491
I think I have come up to the Nabhi Chakra.

812
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,990
tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakras

813
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:31,190
in better, elaborate way

814
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,592
that you will understand

815
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,982
what is the essence of these chakras.

816
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:36,901
That what becomes of you.

817
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,724
They have described to you the chakras

818
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,161
but why these chakras.

819
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,501
What do they mean?

820
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:42,384
These are the different,

821
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:45,214
evolutionary milestones within us,

822
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,037
which have been crossed and the last one

823
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,908
is this one, which you have to cross now. That's all.

824
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:52,978
See you are just ready for it.

825
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,948
You are made for this. God has made you for this.

826
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,128
Its best is that you get to it.

827
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:03,158
And that’s why I was yesterday asking questions

828
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,168
and people have now told Me,

829
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:06,668
 “Mother please don’t ask questions because it is a waste

830
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,458
it’s a waste of time.”

831
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,728
Those people who are asking questions

832
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:12,568
are not asking any sensible questions.

833
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,048
They are not bothered about themselves

834
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,042
why, how they are spending their lives.

835
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:16,688
of course some people

836
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:18,528
asked very sensible questions also

837
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,038
I must say, but there’s no need to ask questions.

838
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:23,138
Let us see if it works out within in you.

839
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:26,058
If it works out it will be a good idea.

840
00:43:26,058 --> 00:43:32,410
Now you want to have Realisation first?
