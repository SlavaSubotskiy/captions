1
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:23,142
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

2
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:29,942
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

3
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:38,392
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

4
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:44,392
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

5
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:50,302
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

6
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:58,143
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

7
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,348
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

8
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:07,408
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

9
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:11,408
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

10
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:21,487
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

11
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:25,938
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

12
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:31,858
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

13
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:39,147
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

14
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:42,158
He would never like you to be unhappy.

15
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:46,847
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

16
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:55,228
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

17
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:59,468
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

18
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:04,787
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

19
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:11,507
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

20
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:15,118
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

21
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,938
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

22
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:26,948
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

23
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:30,438
could do it.

24
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:33,588
But now you all have ascended.

25
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:38,888
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

26
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:42,408
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

27
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:52,338
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

28
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:54,718
He has resurrected you, too.

29
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:58,878
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

30
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:04,778
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

31
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,808
through your Kundalini.

32
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:11,719
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

33
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:18,938
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

34
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,938
demands of His life.

35
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:28,768
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

36
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:35,988
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

37
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:42,398
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

38
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,588
like that.

39
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:50,718
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

40
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:57,168
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

41
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:10,948
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

42
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,738
itself, which He established.

43
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:23,188
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

44
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:26,268
as the Sahaj Yogis.

45
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:29,387
And this is going to be very easy.

46
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:36,977
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

47
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,738
has beautifully settled within you.

48
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:46,248
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

49
00:10:46,248 --> 00:11:00,077
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

50
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,077
to do something.

51
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:06,738
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

52
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:09,178
we are talking.

53
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:18,078
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

54
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,288
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

55
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:27,038
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

56
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:32,198
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

57
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:35,598
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

58
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,158
It is a state.

59
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:41,668
It’s a state of your personality.

60
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,857
And there where I always say…

61
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,518
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

62
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:49,548
The sun is showing its results.

63
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,218
See how the sun listens to me!

64
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:55,028
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

65
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:59,488
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

66
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:14,137
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

67
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:23,477
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

68
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:29,078
and clapping).

69
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:48,858
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

70
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,368
for this puja.

71
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:58,398
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

72
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:02,078
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

73
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,818
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

74
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,658
We have to have the moon there.

75
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,158
It’s important."

76
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:13,378
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

77
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:18,258
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

78
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:22,398
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

79
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:29,718
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

80
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:38,028
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

81
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:44,418
(laughter and clapping).

82
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:56,898
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

83
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:59,698
even worse, every time.

84
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:06,948
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

85
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:14,348
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

86
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:18,468
may spoil your tent.

87
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:27,848
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

88
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,258
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

89
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:35,778
And they did it.

90
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:38,748
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

91
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:43,188
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

92
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,488
So beautiful it was.

93
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:49,118
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

94
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:55,098
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

95
00:14:55,098 --> 00:15:02,188
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

96
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:04,858
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

97
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:11,898
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

98
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,728
have proper temperature.

99
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:16,388
So look at the sky!

100
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:17,448
Look at everything!

101
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,788
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

102
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,068
It’s beautiful!

103
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:26,498
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

104
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:33,758
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

105
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:44,318
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

106
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:53,198
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

107
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,428
Christ resides in the Sun.

108
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:06,168
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

109
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:09,708
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

110
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:14,218
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

111
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:25,368
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

112
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:29,058
He had no defects in Him.

113
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:32,048
He was a perfect personality.

114
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:37,998
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

115
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:42,578
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

116
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:52,288
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

117
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:54,058
it.

118
00:16:54,058 --> 00:17:02,648
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

119
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,648
you.

120
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:12,288
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

121
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,888
He had no problems.

122
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:27,148
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

123
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:29,868
complete compassion.

124
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:38,648
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

125
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:47,978
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

126
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:50,008
they are doing."

127
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:53,578
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

128
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:59,728
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

129
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:02,828
the thing one had to do.

130
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:06,788
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

131
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:13,798
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

132
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:18,048
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

133
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:21,078
He is the pattern we have to follow.

134
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:25,848
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

135
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,338
cross on our shoulder.

136
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:31,568
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

137
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,878
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

138
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,128
Anybody can carry the cross!

139
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:44,888
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

140
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,968
What is so great about it?

141
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:50,888
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

142
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:53,688
It’s nothing great.

143
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:56,918
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

144
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,248
That’s not the point!

145
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:04,878
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

146
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,128
That is what we have to realise.

147
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:15,238
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

148
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,538
that He has come for this great job here.

149
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:24,808
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

150
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:25,808
carpenter.

151
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:33,518
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

152
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:38,748
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

153
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:45,018
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

154
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:49,328
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

155
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:53,758
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

156
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:57,908
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

157
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,978
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

158
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:06,038
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

159
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,478
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

160
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,748
That’s not the way!

161
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:13,438
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

162
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:23,128
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

163
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:30,508
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

164
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:34,098
All of you have to meditate everyday.

165
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:39,038
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

166
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:46,588
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

167
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:48,868
Our lives are for meditation.

168
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:53,908
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

169
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:56,788
Everyday you must meditate.

170
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,698
If you meditate your children will meditate.

171
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:06,208
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

172
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,487
can see work it out.

173
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:15,227
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

174
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:19,948
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

175
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:28,358
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

176
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:32,788
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

177
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:38,708
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

178
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:45,338
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

179
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:52,038
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

180
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:54,178
and you also know how to do it.

181
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:58,788
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

182
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:06,008
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

183
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:11,368
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

184
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:15,018
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

185
00:22:15,018 --> 00:22:20,638
It has no truth in it.

186
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,598
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

187
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:32,558
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

188
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:39,118
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

189
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:41,608
interested in money.

190
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:47,788
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

191
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:52,968
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

192
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:57,868
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

193
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:02,248
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

194
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,758
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

195
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:09,628
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

196
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:21,058
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

197
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:22,378
India you will be shocked.

198
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:27,238
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

199
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:32,138
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

200
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:33,138
means that.

201
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,138
Everything!

202
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:39,228
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

203
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:42,458
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

204
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:48,678
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

205
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:53,108
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

206
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:58,988
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

207
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:05,118
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

208
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:10,408
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

209
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:14,688
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

210
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:19,338
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

211
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:23,718
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

212
00:24:23,718 --> 00:24:26,328
It’s coming to that end.

213
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:33,578
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

214
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:37,178
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

215
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:41,848
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

216
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:44,578
I think I have told it to some people before.

217
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:50,308
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

218
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:54,218
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

219
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,858
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

220
00:24:56,858 --> 00:25:03,298
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

221
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:04,368
which is supposed to be the highest.

222
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:06,668
I don’t know how they call it.

223
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:13,218
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

224
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:15,738
you meat because our fasting is there.

225
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:17,618
But we’ll have lunch."

226
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,588
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

227
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:24,478
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

228
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:25,478
according to them!

229
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:28,298
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

230
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:31,388
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

231
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:35,558
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

232
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,938
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

233
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:45,258
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

234
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:46,258
us.

235
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:49,568
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

236
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,248
and they were laughing and laughing.

237
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:52,798
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

238
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,048
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

239
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:59,168
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

240
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:02,718
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

241
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:05,218
I said, “It’s not."

242
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:15,088
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

243
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:17,758
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

244
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:22,658
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

245
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:24,398
a religion, we have no religion.

246
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,488
Must have some religion."

247
00:26:26,488 --> 00:26:34,268
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

248
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:39,318
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

249
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:42,558
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

250
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,708
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

251
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,808
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

252
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:53,858
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

253
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:56,768
So we can’t have that religion!”

254
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,428
So they cancelled it.

255
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:03,858
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

256
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:10,988
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

257
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:17,128
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

258
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:20,618
They said, “That’s impossible!

259
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,888
How can we follow Islam?

260
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,258
That’s not possible!”

261
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:25,648
So, cancel it!

262
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:30,478
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

263
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:31,478
came.

264
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:34,128
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

265
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:40,808
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

266
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:42,818
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

267
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:46,928
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

268
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:51,648
And that’s how they had this religion there.

269
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:54,268
So this is the situation of the religion today.

270
00:27:54,268 --> 00:28:04,048
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

271
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:11,508
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

272
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:17,148
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

273
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:24,678
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

274
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:28,458
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

275
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:33,688
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

276
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:34,888
become an English man.

277
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:35,968
So you better give me a big name."

278
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,048
They said, “What name you want?”

279
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,338
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

280
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:42,068
So they called him Alexander.

281
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,428
But his name was Blondie, you see.

282
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:50,468
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

283
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:51,468
So Mr.

284
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:56,878
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

285
00:28:56,878 --> 00:29:00,708
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

286
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:01,838
He said, “Why?

287
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:03,718
Why can’t I do that?”

288
00:29:03,718 --> 00:29:07,028
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

289
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,028
will drop out, you see!”

290
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:10,108
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

291
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,368
He said, “This you can’t do!”

292
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:19,528
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

293
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:22,488
mean I have given up my religion!”

294
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:23,488
You see!

295
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:31,208
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

296
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:35,378
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

297
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:40,868
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

298
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:46,648
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

299
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:50,248
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

300
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:58,758
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

301
00:29:58,758 --> 00:30:02,128
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

302
00:30:02,128 --> 00:30:05,118
So you tell me and then go.

303
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:10,858
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

304
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,078
on their Agnyas.

305
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:18,638
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

306
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:21,038
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

307
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,268
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

308
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:27,168
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

309
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:28,168
I said, “What happened?

310
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:29,198
Where did you go?”

311
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,258
“Oh, we went to this temple."

312
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,258
I said, “Why?

313
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:33,378
You never told me.

314
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:34,682
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

315
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:38,518
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

316
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,438
Then it took them one month to clear out!

317
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:47,178
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

318
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:54,058
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

319
00:30:54,058 --> 00:31:01,058
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

320
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,747
So they must have special dresses!

321
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:07,828
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

322
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:11,028
I forgot the name, some big name.

323
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:17,628
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

324
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:23,338
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

325
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:27,248
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

326
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:31,868
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

327
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,148
all caught up.

328
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:40,938
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

329
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:44,078
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

330
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:46,198
You don’t belong to any church.

331
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:48,298
You don’t belong to any temple.

332
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:53,058
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

333
00:31:53,058 --> 00:32:02,078
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

334
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:04,298
He didn’t follow any religion.

335
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,528
He followed His own spiritual religion.

336
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:13,558
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

337
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,178
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

338
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:23,078
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

339
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:28,838
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

340
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:39,138
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

341
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:43,878
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

342
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,878
to Him.

343
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:47,218
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

344
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:49,068
It’s clearly [shown].

345
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,788
You can see it so clearly!

346
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:57,300
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

347
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,878
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

348
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:06,608
We are no more belonging to any religion.

349
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:12,838
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

350
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:19,788
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

351
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:24,178
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

352
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:31,228
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

353
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:37,038
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

354
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,348
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

355
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:46,228
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

356
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:53,028
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

357
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,538
It’s very surprising.

358
00:33:54,538 --> 00:34:02,268
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

359
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:06,958
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

360
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:13,378
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

361
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,409
will do it!

362
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,548
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

363
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:27,598
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

364
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:35,148
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

365
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:39,418
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

366
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,578
It will not.

367
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:45,338
It will not punish you up to a point.

368
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:52,478
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

369
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:59,418
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

370
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:02,988
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

371
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:06,258
We are Sahaj Yogis."

372
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:10,838
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

373
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:13,848
Yet you have not reached that stage.

374
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:18,648
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

375
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:21,418
of the church and run away.

376
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:24,838
They’ll start shaking before you.

377
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,438
They will not know what has happened.

378
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:32,558
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

379
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,208
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

380
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:42,398
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

381
00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:46,628
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

382
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:52,658
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

383
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,458
these are the bhoots sitting here.

384
00:35:54,458 --> 00:36:00,058
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

385
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:04,678
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

386
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:06,487
very, very dangerous.

387
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:14,208
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

388
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,548
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

389
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:19,997
one right-sided.

390
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:25,958
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

391
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,558
It’s the individual that is important.

392
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:33,598
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

393
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:37,598
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

394
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:41,508
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

395
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:49,048
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

396
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:55,008
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

397
00:36:55,008 --> 00:37:03,678
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

398
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:09,488
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

399
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:13,288
collective is lost, completely lost.

400
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:21,968
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

401
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:27,098
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

402
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:28,418
the time.

403
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:29,418
Now why?

404
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:33,398
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

405
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:38,758
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

406
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:42,178
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

407
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,048
The individuals have to be strong.

408
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:50,788
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

409
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:54,028
more than people who can drink here.

410
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:59,487
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

411
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,758
more than even sardarjees.

412
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:07,888
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

413
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:11,208
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

414
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:20,097
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

415
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:26,518
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

416
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:31,378
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

417
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,718
He’s still there.

418
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:36,668
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

419
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,248
So that fails.

420
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:40,998
So the individuals are weak in that case.

421
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:48,008
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

422
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:50,557
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

423
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:56,228
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

424
00:38:56,228 --> 00:39:03,138
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

425
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:04,228
to bear them.

426
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:07,788
An individual cannot bear money.

427
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:10,998
He cannot bear power of any kind.

428
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:13,918
He cannot bear love.

429
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,238
He cannot bear kindness.

430
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:23,648
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

431
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:30,908
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

432
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:41,058
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

433
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:47,208
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

434
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,118
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

435
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:55,398
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

436
00:39:55,398 --> 00:40:05,938
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

437
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:13,888
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

438
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:15,528
collective.

439
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:21,618
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

440
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:27,208
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

441
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:31,557
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

442
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:39,208
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

443
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:47,938
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

444
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:51,768
quality to enjoy the joy.

445
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:58,208
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

446
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:05,028
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

447
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:10,038
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

448
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:19,078
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

449
00:41:19,078 --> 00:41:21,148
acting, it’s insensitive.

450
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:28,688
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

451
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:32,458
going to be dropped out.

452
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:40,768
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

453
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,328
collective.

454
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:48,268
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

455
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:49,688
have to be collective.

456
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:53,928
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

457
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,388
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

458
00:41:56,388 --> 00:42:01,688
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

459
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,418
Better find faults with yourself.

460
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:07,128
The rest I’ll look after.

461
00:42:07,128 --> 00:42:14,028
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

462
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:16,908
enjoy the company of others.

463
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:25,238
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

464
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:32,208
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

465
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:37,118
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

466
00:42:37,118 --> 00:42:42,108
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

467
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:50,068
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

468
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:56,658
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

469
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,988
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

470
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:10,598
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

471
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:23,738
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

472
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:25,138
Where are we?

473
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:26,998
Where do we stand?

474
00:43:26,998 --> 00:43:28,658
What are we up to?

475
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:30,758
What are we doing?

476
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:32,768
What is our responsibility?

477
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,678
What is expected of us?

478
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,518
Why all these blessings are given to us?

479
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:41,928
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

480
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:50,318
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

481
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:52,038
I think it’s my commitment.

482
00:43:52,038 --> 00:44:01,538
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

483
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,538
should be pure.

484
00:44:02,538 --> 00:44:07,138
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

485
00:44:07,138 --> 00:44:10,678
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

486
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:14,428
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

487
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:18,508
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

488
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:20,557
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

489
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:28,278
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

490
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:34,168
just, I don’t know what they do.

491
00:44:34,168 --> 00:44:35,168
(laughter)

492
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:46,718
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

493
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:47,718
to stand up.

494
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,498
Now the children are coming up.

495
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:51,558
They are also going to stand up.

496
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,428
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

497
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:56,438
Every day I see you, you look younger.

498
00:44:56,438 --> 00:45:00,388
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

499
00:45:00,388 --> 00:45:08,528
son or is he the father?

500
00:45:08,528 --> 00:45:17,108
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

501
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:20,518
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

502
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:21,918
Now, so what?

503
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:25,768
These are temptations, be careful.

504
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:27,537
This is not what you wanted.

505
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:36,148
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

506
00:45:36,148 --> 00:45:42,358
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

507
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:43,358
It works!

508
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:45,478
That’s [what] the point is.

509
00:45:45,478 --> 00:45:54,918
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

510
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,048
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

511
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,488
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

512
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:04,028
He was very young, I must say.

513
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:09,348
But how much He has done for humanity.

514
00:46:09,348 --> 00:46:13,218
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

515
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,358
It’s remarkable!

516
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,068
It’s really remarkable!

517
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:21,278
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

518
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:26,398
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

519
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:29,188
And today is the day of certain promises.

520
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:30,558
May God bless you for that.

521
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:33,818
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
