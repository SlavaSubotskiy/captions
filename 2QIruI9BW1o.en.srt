1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,320
It is my immense joy\h\h

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,920
to see all of you here from\h
various parts of this world.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:30,320
When your heart is so full the words\h
are too poor to carry the intensity.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,400
I wish you could understand that\h
intensity, through your heart.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,920
It’s all been arranged, I think, by the\h
Divine, that we should meet here all of us\h\h

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
in such a wonderful surrounding, in the Nature.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
That something great should happen to all of us.

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:11,840
That we should achieve really\h
something great this time.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,760
Now as the time is short, I\h
will tell you, first of all,\h\h

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:39,920
a few things about meditation now, then\h
we’ll have two more talks, I hope so.

11
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
‘Meditation’ is a very general word.

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,840
It is not a word that explains all the\h
three steps one has to take for meditating.

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:07,840
But in Sanskrit language they have very clearly\h
said how you have to move in your meditation.

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,040
First is called as dhyan,\h\h

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,840
and second is called as dharana,\h
and the third is called as samadhi.

16
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
Luckily Sahaja Yoga is a, such a thing\h
that you get everything in a bundle.

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
You avoided everything else\h
and you got the samadhi part.

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,840
That’s the beauty of it.

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
Firstly the dhyana:\h\h

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:03:00,240
First, when you have seeking, you put your\h
attention towards the object of your worship.

21
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,920
That’s called as ‘dhyana’.

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
And the dharana is the one in which you\h\h

23
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,200
put all your effort, concentrate all your effort.

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,000
But this is all drama for\h
people who are not Realised.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:39,360
For them it’s just a sort of an acting that they\h
do, but for a Realised-soul it is a reality.

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
So the first, the dhyan, you have to do.

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless.

28
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
But you are so fortunate that the\h
Formless has become a Form for you.

29
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
No problem! You don’t have to go from\h
form to formless and from formless\h\h

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
to form, it’s all there, in a bundle!

31
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:35,200
So you concentrate, or think, of some deity\h\h

32
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,440
or some point for nirakar (formless),\h
for the Formless, or of nirakar itself.

33
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,840
It’s also mental projection as long\h
as you are not a Realised-soul.

34
00:04:48,800 --> 00:05:01,200
But once you are Realised, you have to just\h
think of dhyana: [on] whom you are going\h\h

35
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
to concentrate, or you can say, meditate on.

36
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
But once you start meditating on a\h
person your attention starts moving.

37
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
That is also possible after Realisation.

38
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Though it’s in a bundle, but some people\h
have it, part of it, part of it, like that.

39
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,040
So when you meditate,\h\h

40
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,840
still your attention can\h
get disturbed every moment.

41
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,000
It can happen, depending on the\h
intensity of your concentration.

42
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
So there are some Sahaja Yogis I have seen:\h\h

43
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,480
they are cooking, and there’s\h
another one who is meditating.

44
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:09,240
The meditating one will say, “Oh I can smell\h
it is burning,” So there is no dharana (धारा).

45
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
‘Dhaar’ means a flow, a continuous flow.

46
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
So there is no dharana.

47
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Dhyana is there, but not dharana.

48
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:27,520
The second part of it is very important – that\h
you have to put your attention continuously\h\h

49
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
onto your deity.

50
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,760
Then you develop a state, which is called as\h
‘dharana’, in which your attention becomes one\h\h

51
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
with the deity.

52
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
But when these mature, the\h
third stage of samadhi comes in.

53
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Now for people who think that,\h
without Realisation, they can\h\h

54
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,840
do it, I think they are absolutely mistaken.

55
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:16,480
But after Realisation also, when the\h
dharana is established, you have to\h\h

56
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,800
get to the position where you become samadhi.

57
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
Now, what is that state?

58
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:39,200
When that state comes into your mind then,\h
whatever you do, the deity that you worship,\h\h

59
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,920
you see that deity in your work.

60
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Whatever you see, you see the\h
deity giving you the show.

61
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
You can put it (describe it) like that.

62
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:08,240
Whatever you hear, you find the\h
deity telling you the Truth.

63
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Whatever you read, you find there\h
what the deity would tell you.

64
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:28,480
So in that state, whatever you do with\h
your eyes, nose, and all these organs,\h\h

65
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:42,960
all that becomes a kind of a manifestation of\h
the deity whom you worship – automatically.

66
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,320
You don’t have to think, “Now\h
I must concentrate, alright.

67
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
I will not have these thoughts."

68
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
“I have to now think about this."

69
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
It becomes automatically that.

70
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,680
You read a book, in that book immediately\h
you find what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

71
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
If there’s a book, which is\h
anti-God, you discard it.

72
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,560
But if you have\h\h

73
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:30,000
a problem, you see that, “It\h
must be for some lesson to me.

74
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,840
That it is to teach me some experience."

75
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,400
It is the manifestation of the deity itself.

76
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
For example a lady feels she is going\h
to have an abortion, take a position.

77
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,120
So one person who is not yet in samadhi avasta,\h\h

78
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,520
or condition, will say, “Oh God, I am such a\h
Sahaja Yogi, I have done so much for Mother.

79
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,960
I went all the way to Pulborough thing, and,\h
despite that, see, this is the problem!”

80
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
But another would say that, “Alright let me try.

81
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,120
I’ll go and tell Mother."

82
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
On the photograph, or maybe telephone, something.

83
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,760
And he’ll find, to his\h
surprise, that it’s all done.

84
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,080
It’s perfectly alright.

85
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,840
This is only possible if you are a\h
Realised-soul, otherwise not possible.

86
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,680
So the state that is awakened within\h
you is called, is a new state of mind,\h\h

87
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,640
in Sanskrit language it has a very\h
beautiful name is ‘Rutumbhara Pradnya’.

88
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,742
Which is a very difficult name.

89
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,362
Rutumbhara Pradnya.

90
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,520
Rutumbhara means the whole, Rutumbhara\h\h

91
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,640
is the name of the Nature.

92
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,840
And that the whole Nature,\h
one feels, is enlightened.

93
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:13,840
I’ll give an example: when a child is to be\h
born, the mother starts lactating, automatically.

94
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,480
The Nature itself works out\h
for the birth of the child.

95
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,160
In the same way, when this Rutumbhara\h
Pradnya, starts expressing itself,\h\h

96
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,400
only for Sahaja Yogis, nobody else, you\h
are amazed how things work out suddenly.

97
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,240
Rutumbhara Pradnya it works out.

98
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
Now the time is very short,\h
but I’ll give you an example.

99
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
I came to Brighton,\h\h

100
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
and Jason said, “Mother let’s\h
have Guru Puja in Brighton”.

101
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,000
I said, “Alright, have it.

102
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
But you find out the place."

103
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,240
So he went to the university, said,\h
“The university people will help,\h\h

104
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,040
but it’s rather small and…”\h
I said, “But ask them”.

105
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,280
But, “No, it’s booked on Guru Puja."

106
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,880
Then I said, ”Then what can you do?”\h
He said, “Then what to do Mother?”

107
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
I said, “You try somewhere else just now.

108
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,400
Telephone to somebody else."

109
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,160
So he went through yellow pages, I don’t\h
know what, and he telephoned, and they said,\h\h

110
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:26,320
“We have a place, a beautiful place, and\h
you come along and have lunch with us."

111
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,520
And just he went there.

112
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,960
He had a very nice lunch, they were very happy\h
[that] they were to accommodate everyone.

113
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,320
They were very nice, and he was amazed\h
how everything has worked out so well!

114
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,400
So the Rutumbhara Pradnya has\h
started working in your favour.

115
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,960
You all tell me, “This is a miracle,\h
that has happened Mother, and we don’t\h\h

116
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,240
know how it has happened!” I’ll give you\h
an example: Yesterday, you we were doing\h\h

117
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,520
something with cement and the Italian boy\h
said that we’ll need two bags of cement.

118
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,040
I said, “You carry on, it won’t finish!” Even\h
before I was leaving, they were carrying on,\h\h

119
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,640
still not finished! Now cement of all the things.

120
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,120
Imagine!

121
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,760
So this special thing is your\h
own state, where you are feeling\h\h

122
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,720
the oneness with the Nature and the\h
Nature is feeling oneness with you.

123
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,840
So the Divine itself is expressing through\h
Nature, through various happenings, through\h\h

124
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:45,040
various incidents – the Love, the protection,\h
the attention that the Divine is giving.

125
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,280
And there’s no end to it.

126
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,280
It just happens, and people\h
don’t know how it happens.

127
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,320
But that is what is the state of samadhi.

128
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
But there could be people if I tell them,\h\h

129
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
“Will you do this?” “Oh no\h
Mother! The shop will be closed."

130
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,480
“Oh, They won’t do it!” “That’s not alright”.

131
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,840
They go on like that.

132
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,960
And there are people who say, “No! Let’s see.

133
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,480
If Mother has said – maybe."

134
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,240
I’ll give you another simple example, very simple,\h
absolutely gross, but it’s there: One day Mr.

135
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,200
Shrivastava, he takes one type of tea.

136
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Very English! And he wouldn’t like other tea.

137
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
So he told me, “Oh God, we are finished with\h
the tea and what to do tomorrow morning?”\h\h

138
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
I said, ”It’s alright, let us go to the tea shop."

139
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,160
So he said, “It is eight o’clock\h
in the night and what do you mean?

140
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,960
They’ll all laugh at us! There is\h
no shop at eight o’clock open."

141
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,200
That tea centre.

142
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,640
I said, “Let’s go! What’s the harm.

143
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,800
I am just saying ‘let’s go!’ ” But he said,\h\h

144
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,680
“What absurd things you are saying!” I\h
said, “Alright, absurd whatever it is.

145
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,840
Let’s go!” So he wouldn’t listen so I told the\h
driver “Alright, let’s drive down!” We went there.

146
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
And the lights were on.

147
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,000
We said, “Eh! How is it the\h
lights are on?” (laughter)\h\h

148
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,760
So we walked in, you see, very peevishly.

149
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,640
And they all were there standing,\h
“Oh we’ve been waiting for you\h\h

150
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,640
such a long time, and you are the last to\h
come!” Just imagine! So I asked my husband.

151
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,720
He said, “I forgot we had a\h
reception here!” (laughter).

152
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,000
And they said, “You are the last to\h
arrive!” And they said, “Alright,\h\h

153
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:54,840
doesn’t matter but you’ll have your presents!”\h
So they gave us two tins each of tea! (laughter)

154
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,120
I mean, there are thousand\h
and one examples like that.

155
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Today like some were trying to push the bed.

156
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,520
The three of them were trying, it would not push.

157
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
I said, “Alright, I’ll push it."

158
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,280
I just put my Nabhi there.

159
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
Just, I didn’t push anything, it just pushed.

160
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,640
Because of the Rutumbhara Pradnya .

161
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,800
But this is not chamatkar (miracle) or anything.

162
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,280
It exists in the Divine the capacity\h\h

163
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:36,240
to manifest it’s love, to show that you are\h
the saints, you are the chosen ones of God.

164
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
But you accept that situation first.

165
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,120
But if you behave like all other normal\h
people, “Oh God, the shops are closed, and\h\h

166
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,280
that man is so difficult, and I don’t\h
think it will happen” – never happen.

167
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:59,440
But you must know you are saints, chosen, and\h
given birth by me – The Form and the Formless.

168
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,360
So this Pradnya is going to manifest,\h
is manifesting every moment.

169
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,880
Be prepared, be happy, welcome\h
it, and accept that you are that.

170
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,840
The level is different.

171
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Now the time has come for Sahaja\h
Yoga to change it’s level.

172
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
We have to change.

173
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,040
We have to go higher.

174
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,240
The level has to come up.

175
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,600
But Sahaja Yoga is such a cosmopolitan thing\h
that we have got the worst bhoots to the highest,\h\h

176
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,680
on the same plate.

177
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:17,920
Now, some of them are round ones, which are\h
the ego-oriented ones, who roll all the time.

178
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
They don’t know how to raise the plate.

179
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
If you raise the plate they’ll roll down.

180
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
So you are frightened you have to hold them.

181
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
And there are some who are squares.

182
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,760
And the square ones are carrying other\h
squares on their heads, like bhoots.

183
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,800
So if you raise them they may all topple\h
down, or maybe the bhoots might fall off.

184
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,280
God knows.

185
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,520
But there are third type who are\h
prisms, who are like pyramids,\h\h

186
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,080
who are nicely settled down, whatever\h
level you raise them, they are stuck there.

187
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,280
So those who are at the periphery\h
are a problem, definitely, for me,\h\h

188
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,680
because in my compassion I cannot throw them out.

189
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:30,480
And we have to help them to come out, by really\h
now, telling them, that they have to rise.

190
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
How long are we to wait for them?

191
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,400
Everyone has to see that the peripheral people\h\h

192
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,840
are brought in properly so that\h
they don’t go out of Sahaja Yoga.

193
00:19:51,840 --> 00:20:02,400
Compassion is alright but not at the cost of\h
keeping the level of Sahaja Yoga lower, never!

194
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,240
We have to raise the level of people\h
who are well settled in Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:22,240
So everybody must try to settle down and\h
come up to minimum standards at least.

196
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
Otherwise, I am sorry, many will be sieved out.

197
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,880
That’s for the five minutes!\h\h

198
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,440
I’ll have another, I think, one hour or\h
so, one and a half hour later on today.

199
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Please.

200
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Thank you very much.

201
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,960
I would say that somebody\h
should translate it if possible.

202
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,840
Is it possible to translate?

203
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,397
Yogi: We could translate it afterwards, Mother.

204
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,975
Shri Mataji: In French after?

205
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,640
To be told them Rutumbhara Pradnya and all that.

206
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Later on you can translate.

207
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,400
I mean those who have to go for\h
lunch now should be English then.

208
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,120
Then he can explain it, the first\h
part, as you please, I don’t know.

209
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Those who are staying here, should not.

210
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
Those who are come, should.

211
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,760
It’s wrong.

212
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,840
The guests must be looked after,\h
I mean, the other way round.

213
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,720
Now we have to divide in two halves, but\h
I would say those who understand English\h\h

214
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,840
should go because then Gregoire can speak about\h
this and somebody can translate also in Italian.

215
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Gregoire: Shri Mother, I’m sorry, but it’s\h
already divided with numbers in two lots,\h\h

216
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
so I think the first number has just to go.

217
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
Shri Mataji: Is it already divided?

218
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,092
Gregoire: Yes it’s already…

219
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:12,319
Shri Mataji: …organised!!!

220
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:12,960
Gregoire: Organised.

221
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,778
(laughter and applause)

222
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:14,720
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

223
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
I didn’t know who is here unhappy.

224
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Both of you have come?

225
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,800
Yogi: Mother?

226
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,040
Shri Mataji: Only two of you have come?

227
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Yogi: Three.

228
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,800
Shri Mataji: Who is?

229
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

230
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,927
Shri Mataji: Who?

231
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,896
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

232
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,440
Shri Mataji: Good, good.

233
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,920
Busy hai! Good.

234
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,760
So how are you?

235
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,420
Yogi: I’m alright now.

236
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,919
Shri Mataji: ….substantially support Sahaja Yoga.

237
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,040
Like Dr.

238
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:54,880
Warren has brought a very good extract, I think.

239
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,520
Is it an extract?

240
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,731
Gavin: Yes you read it Mother, you read it.

241
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:04,159
Shri Mataji: Just imagine! He was\h
a Catholic Christian church fellow\h\h

242
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
who could say all these things\h
so clearly and see so clearly.

243
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,840
And this book, you see, Essenes, that a book.

244
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,760
But now Rustom told me that\h
he has found out, in the\h\h

245
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:44,240
Koran, that the Kundalini resides in\h
the triangular bone is called as Asus.

246
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,840
And at the time of Resurrection this will be\h
raised and people will get their Realisation.

247
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,800
Can you imagine?

248
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,960
The second thing he said, the same\h
thing which has written in these books\h\h

249
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,240
that there are seven firmaments\h
and there are seven powers.

250
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,520
Can you imagine?

251
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,720
All that is described in the Koran\h
and what are these Muslims doing\h\h

252
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
and what are these Christians doing?

253
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,040
But even those who knew, the Hindus,\h
so-called, what are they doing, stupid.

254
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:38,160
Everybody seems to be stupid! You can’t blame\h
those who knew and you can’t blame those did not.

255
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,320
They are just the same.

256
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,160
It’s very clearly written all about the seven\h
chakras and everything since the Patanjali.

257
00:24:51,680 --> 00:25:00,160
But who is seeking God?

258
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,360
But these discoveries are coming up and they\h
are going to substantiate and you are going\h\h

259
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:13,840
to talk to these people about the kind of things\h
they have been doing to the essence of religion.

260
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
But these are authentic things.

261
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
People want to believe into\h
something that has happened.

262
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:41,840
That’s a good thing in a way\h
because we have some certificates.

263
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,200
Nobody wants to ask any questions to me?

264
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:55,840
Because one third [of the yogis] is missing so I\h
would like to speak about general things later on.

265
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,271
Yes, yes?

266
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:17,619
Yogi: We were just talking about your comments.

267
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,560
For example in Islam we were talking about\h
the Mahedi who looks like a Muslim with a\h\h

268
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,240
beard and in Buddhism they are talking\h
about a Maitreya who is like a man.

269
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,040
Every religion is talking about\h\h

270
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,240
a coming who is in their own form, I mean,\h
projecting (their imagination of Mother).

271
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,040
What about this?

272
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,569
But they are all talking about your coming.

273
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,240
Shri Mataji:\h\h

274
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,080
Many of these scriptures are\h
mutilated and changed also.

275
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,720
And Buddha of course is a laughing Buddha.

276
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,640
They think of ‘laughing Buddha’.

277
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,000
Then because it was Mohammed\h
Sahib they think of a fakir.

278
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,560
Because your mind is like a projector,\h\h

279
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,312
and the film is what you have\h
seen before, like Mohammed Sahib.

280
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:24,800
So the mind projects it and you\h
get Mohammed Sahib as the image.

281
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,280
So whatever film you are\h
using it depends on [that].

282
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,920
But whatever has happened never happens again.

283
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,000
So if you have seen with the film, say,\h\h

284
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
for example, if you have made\h
a film, it’s made once for all.

285
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
You do not make the same film, do you?

286
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,240
I mean you are having “Mouse Trap” (play in London\h
theatre) for so many days here, for example.

287
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,920
But every time you see that, acting changes.

288
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,360
And every two, three years the actors also change.

289
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,440
So though the essence is the same going on\h
the same thing is now going to be repeated.

290
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Mohammed Sahib’s life is not going to be repeated.

291
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,120
Nor is He going to come in\h
the way he came as a fakir.

292
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,880
No! That has never happened in\h
the history, why will it happen?

293
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,360
So every time whatever has\h
to happen has to be new.

294
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
That’s the style the Nature is.

295
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
It doesn’t want to bore you\h
say with the same (laughing).

296
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,280
And that kind of life [is] no more needed also.

297
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:02,560
And thirdly, as the seed grows first the\h
roots have to fight a lot to embed the seed,\h\h

298
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,840
and then shoot has to fight a\h
lot, but when the tree is there\h\h

299
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,080
then it supports others, it helps others.

300
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,920
It becomes a strong flowering\h
plant or a flowering tree.

301
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,640
So the whole thing is changed every\h
moment, which is no more the seed.

302
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,680
But people want to see the seed again.

303
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:31,920
Why?

304
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,840
You are identified! It’s\h
very subtle identification.

305
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,320
Christians are more identified with\h
Christ than with Mohammed Sahib.

306
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,320
Why?

307
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,880
While the Muslims are much more\h
identified with Mohammed Sahib.

308
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,440
But why?

309
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Is there any reason?

310
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
They equally intensely identified,\h
for no rhyme and reason.

311
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
None of Them gave them Realisation.

312
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,280
They told the same thing.

313
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,320
But why this identification so much with this?

314
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,720
Now, when you are walking, you are thirsty,\h
you see a river – whether it is the river\h\h

315
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,080
Ganges or Jamuna or any other river\h
– if you are thirsty you will drink.

316
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,920
You won’t say, “No, I won’t drink\h
because the Ganges is not here."

317
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,200
Now supposing I, say, in London, “I\h
will only have the Ganges water."

318
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Will I have?

319
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,240
But there are mad people\h
I tell you, even in India.

320
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,600
I was told some people brought\h
the water of Ganges and the\h\h

321
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,120
clay from there, to clean\h
their hands here, from India.

322
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,840
I mean they can do it.

323
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,520
This is what Sahaja Yogis must understand.

324
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,280
That drop out your identifications\h
with the past life.

325
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,480
If you are born a Christian, alright, so what?

326
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,160
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi! If you\h
are born as a Muslim, so what?

327
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,640
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi! The second part\h
– what happens to you – I’ll tell when we\h\h

328
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:42,080
have the second lecture that, as a Sahaja\h
Yogi how things drop out automatically.

329
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,840
Alright?

330
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,480
So these people are not the ones who are\h
really following any religion whatsoever.

331
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,800
They are following their\h
ego religion, that’s what.

332
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
There’s no religion in this kind of thing.

333
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,760
So all these identifications just\h
should drop out, when you understand.

334
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:16,240
Only there’s one way of convincing them\h
is to show that all of them who have died,\h\h

335
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,880
who are no more here, have said\h
that Sahaja Yoga is going to come.

336
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,840
That’s the only way you can\h
convince these hard nuts.

337
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:41,840
This is the problem.

338
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,400
But surprisingly Muslims\h
never talk of Resurrection.

339
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
They are not bothered about Resurrection.

340
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
They are only worried about\h
the doomsday, like French.

341
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,680
French are now thinking that\h
doomsday going to come definitely.

342
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,480
I mean somebody asked me, “Are You sure it’s going\h
to come or it’s postponed?” I said, “Postponed,\h\h

343
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,840
forever” (laughing).

344
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
Very seriously, I tell you.

345
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Very serious people asked me that, “What do\h
you say if doomsday is coming or not?” And\h\h

346
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,080
they were quite disappointed because\h
they were banking upon it (laughing).

347
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,200
This could be with anyone.

348
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,000
I am just saying French, because they were\h
French who asked me, but could be anyone.

349
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:51,840
I mean don’t be identified again.

350
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,320
Like I was telling today that they show\h
advertisements sometimes, so horrible\h\h

351
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,720
that they will show as if some miracle is going\h
to happen and suddenly lot of ice will break,\h\h

352
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,920
this will happen, that will happen\h
and what will come out is a lager.

353
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,840
I mean really from sublime to ridiculous!\h
Horrible! You just can’t understand that.

354
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,040
But I really laughed you know one day.

355
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,040
There was a gentleman sitting, he said,\h
“Why did you laugh?” I said, “What is this?

356
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,200
Sublime to ridiculous!” He\h
said, “What do you mean?

357
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,480
I like my beer!” I said, “Sorry!” That’s it.

358
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
The identification is like that, you see.

359
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,840
Even ridiculous things start\h
looking so fine if you identified.

360
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,880
I hope all of you are Sahaja Yogis here.

361
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,840
Or they are still Doubting Thomas’s sitting?

362
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,840
They will have a bad time I must say!\h\h

363
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,840
It’s a very powerful session.

364
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:29,840
Now don’t you worry! Don’t\h
doubt yourself, it’s alright.

365
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,840
What about other questions?

366
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,720
That was a good one.

367
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,360
Don’t depend on their images.

368
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,840
That’s why these days most of\h
the gurus are keeping dadees.

369
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,160
It’s very easy to grow there.

370
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,720
I can’t.

371
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,819
But for any person to grow is alright.

372
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:02,240
When you feel they don’t\h
grow they can’t put on one.

373
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
So do become angry with them?

374
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Yogini:\h\h

375
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,840
What happens with those people who got\h
Realisation from you at your programmes,\h\h

376
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
but they don’t getting to Sahaja Yoga?

377
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,760
What happens with them?

378
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,160
Shri Mataji: They don’t grow, they are dwarves.

379
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,840
Yogini: What’s the meaning of that?

380
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Shri Mataji: That’s very bad to be a seed\h
which has been sprouted and goes to waste.

381
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,640
Is a real waste.

382
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
Because, which is not\h
sprouted, may one day sprout.

383
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,800
It’s a real waste I tell you.

384
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,880
But mostly they come back,\h
quite dwarf, but come back.

385
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
They go, come, like that, you see.

386
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:10,640
There’s no understanding about the graveness\h
of this kind of a shallow behaviour.

387
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
They don’t understand, that’s\h
why they behave like that.

388
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,960
But then they get something horrible,\h
then they come to Sahaja Yoga.

389
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,800
They go into problems then they come.

390
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,280
But the progress is so little.

391
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
I mean the one who must have\h
come with them goes much higher.

392
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
So what is the programme in the evening?

393
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,800
How are you going to do it?

394
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,587
Gavin Brown: Do you mean the one that\h
is written on the programme, Mother?

395
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:49,840
Shri Mataji: Alright, it’s all organised?

396
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:04,546
If Sahaja Yogis organise\h
I have to obey! (laughter)

397
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:08,640
Gavin: In the afternoon it’s a\h
writers meeting with the publisher.

398
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,760
Shri Mataji: What the meeting?

399
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,720
Gavin: Writers.

400
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,000
They said, “Before you arrive."

401
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,457
You have arrived though.

402
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:15,440
(laughter)

403
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,897
Shri Mataji: What was it?

404
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:18,880
Gavin: It\h\h

405
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,120
says, “Writers collective meeting with\h
publisher (venue to be announced).

406
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,960
Or b) Bhajan rehearsal in lecture hall."

407
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
Shri Mataji: So who were the writers?

408
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,320
Gavin: It doesn’t say.

409
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,360
(laughter) Then it says, “More\h
spontaneous and unplanned events."

410
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,840
Shri Mataji: Gavin, are you writing poetry?

411
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,291
(laughing)

412
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,318
Gavin: It’s not me who has written, Mother.

413
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:49,580
Shri Mataji: Who is written?

414
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:49,760
You?

415
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,400
You yourself.

416
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,520
Gavin: This is Jason.

417
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,320
I am just reading it out.

418
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,480
Shri Mataji: They said that, “Likha Mose\h
padel tha…” The Moses have written and the\h\h

419
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,520
one who knows about Moses has written,\h
is only Isa – means Jesus Christ.

420
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Ah.

421
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,640
So what is it?

422
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,600
“Spontaneously…”?

423
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:13,840
Gavin: “Spontaneous and unplanned events\h
and preparation for Shri Mataji’s arrival."

424
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,463
(Laughter).

425
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:16,240
Shri Mataji: He is playing safe!\h\h

426
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,493
Alright, then.

427
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:28,560
Gavin: “Then four o’clock pm,\h
approximately Shri Mataji arrives.

428
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,000
This is subject to change."

429
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,227
(laughter)

430
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:36,800
Shri Mataji: Alright, then.

431
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,577
Gavin: Then there’s nothing\h
[scheduled] until seven o’clock.

432
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:38,960
Shri Mataji: Ah, then,\h
nothing until seven o’clock?

433
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,800
That’s the way.

434
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,240
Now.

435
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,960
Should I tell you?

436
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,800
Let’s have it like that – spontaneously.

437
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:58,720
I have arrived earlier, so, what we do now\h
[is] you have your lunch and rest for a while.

438
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,120
And then, after the lunch, about an hour\h
or so you come along and assemble here.

439
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,000
And you have a thing called\h
that ‘Brain Trust’ business.

440
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,960
Where were you talk to each other, have a\h
rapport, ask questions, tell people, like that.

441
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,840
It’s a very good thing.

442
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,280
You appoint some people for that.

443
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,800
Go about like that till you have your tea.

444
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,160
Then after tea I’ll take over.

445
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,680
Alright?

446
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,880
But that doesn’t mean you should not attend\h
all the rest! You all should sit down and talk.

447
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,320
It helps a lot.

448
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,120
And help each other.

449
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,720
Ask questions and things openly.

450
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,269
And then after that is the dinner and\h
after dinner…what time is the tea?

451
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,040
Gavin: There’s no tea as such, Mother.

452
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,040
But the only fixed time is seven\h
o’clock for the barbecue dinner and then\h\h

453
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,666
the dancing will be about half past eight.

454
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:17,704
Shri Mataji: Alright.

455
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:17,752
And the tea is at what time?

456
00:41:17,752 --> 00:41:17,884
Gavin: I think we can have it about\h
four but there’s nothing written down.

457
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:17,932
Shri Mataji: Five o’clock?

458
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:17,960
Five o’clock.

459
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,000
Say, four thirty five.

460
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,120
Finish it by five, say.

461
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
Hmm?

462
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,320
And let’s start at five thirty, to six or seven.

463
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,080
Then we’ll have a barbecue dinner.

464
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
And after the barbecue dinner\h
we’ll have the music program.

465
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,320
Alright?

466
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:47,840
Then tomorrow you can have dhyana, meditation, in\h
the morning and about, say…you must get up early.

467
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,000
And after that you can get your tea,\h
I don’t know whenever you feel like.

468
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,360
I don’t know what the style is.

469
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,400
And after the dhyana is over then you can\h
come for your breakfast or whatever it is.

470
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,920
And then you have again a\h
little seminar sort of a thing.

471
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,480
This is at twelve [that] you go for is it?

472
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,160
Gavin: Well tomorrow there’s no staff here.

473
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,120
We make our own lunch arrangements.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
