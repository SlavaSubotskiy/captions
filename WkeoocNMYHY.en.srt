1
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,180
We 

2
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,180
have today come to this famous place, Hyderabad,
which was ruled by Muslim kings, but they

3
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:41,460
were very Indian and they fought also for
the independence of India with the British.

4
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:55,110
You know about Tipu Sultan, who was also a
realized soul but he was killed.

5
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,430
We have in our country one very big problem
and that is, individually we are all great

6
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,750
people, but when it comes to collective we
don't know how to live collectively, and that

7
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:40,229
is why we lost our independence. Anybody can
manage us. If we can open our eyes and see,

8
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:04,190
it is quite easily understood that when people
try to talk ill of others, involving us, there

9
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,020
must be some intention. This has been our
failing since long, that people use such methods

10
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:33,979
that they spoil the relationships. And this
should not crawl into Sahaja Yoga. When I

11
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:52,159
am in India I think I should put some light
on our weaknesses also.

12
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:02,270
The second weakness we have, that we are very
involved with our family; with our children,

13
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:09,849
with our parents, with our brothers, cousins,
this, that. Till you are completely deceived

14
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,900
or cheated by someone so close, you'll never
learn a lesson. We`are very involved; all

15
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,120
our problems are around them. We cannot get
out of our family. All the time we start thinking

16
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:39,459
that: "Sahaja Yoga should help my family.
Sahaja Yoga should do this for my family."

17
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:47,449
In Sahaja Yoga there's another family that
has nothing to do with your family. I have

18
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:01,209
seen people, Sahaja Yogis who are of a very
high level, and suddenly I find they have

19
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,209
gone down. They have no reason to suffer in
health or in any way. Then I find out that

20
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:20,459
they're attached to some brother or someone
who is doing some other kind of guru business.

21
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:35,050
Instead of we influencing them, they start
influencing us. So we have to really break

22
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,980
our relationships with all such people who
are negative, because we have had relations

23
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:57,530
and relations and relations all our lives.
What did we get out of them? If we do not

24
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:07,030
understand how important it is to be a Sahaja
Yogi, that you are the instrument of God Almighty.

25
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:16,850
So many things you know that even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha did not know. They didn't

26
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,910
know much about Kundalini. They didn't know
how to raise the Kundalini. They didn't know

27
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,910
how to give Realization, except for gurus.
Out of them also you know that Janaka had

28
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,740
only one disciple. All of them had one each.
So certain things you know are more than anybody

29
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,160
had known before. But still if you are sticking
on to your old standards and old methods and

30
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,939
confusing them with Sahaja Yoga, identifying
with them as Sahaja Yoga, then your growth

31
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:11,939
will be very little. So I have to tell you
that, try to get out of this. “Who is my

32
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:23,439
brother? Who is my sister?” Of course it's
a good thing to be attached, in a way, to

33
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,750
the duties that you have to perform towards
everyone, but all the duties should be done

34
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,750
in such a manner that you do not get involved
into it. It is very important that you should

35
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,680
not get involved with those duties. Whatever
has to be done you should do, but you shouldn't

36
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,680
worry as to the fruit of it. Talking ill about
others, saying things just to spoil the relationship

37
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:11,329
is sin, in Sahaja Yoga. Always talk good things
about others. For example, if somebody comes

38
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,839
and tells Me that such and such person is
not good and all that, I tell them lies. I

39
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,319
tell them: "That person was praising you so
much. Why are you saying all these things

40
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:31,029
against that person?"

41
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:38,029
So it is important for Sahaja Yogis to create
a more synthesis, more coordination, more

42
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,579
combinations and more bringing in more and
more people. But people get more attached

43
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,610
to the negative people than to the positive
people. That means still you are not in Sahaja

44
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:14,630
Yoga fully. Once you start understanding this
it would be very, very clear-cut what you

45
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,940
should do and what you should not do as far
as these relationships are concerned. I mean,

46
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:34,010
in India it's a common thing for a minister
to appoint his nephew, his son, his wife,

47
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,829
his grandson, even his servant into some post.
It's a common thing, whether they are capable

48
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:47,829
or not. But in Sahaja Yoga you can't do. You
have to be a Sahaja Yogi. You can't just get

49
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,260
anybody because he's your relation and ask
that: "Mother, see now, he's my relation.

50
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,589
Please help this man." Why should God help
people who are not Sahaja Yogis? He does not

51
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:10,589
know them and He doesn't want to do it. So
our concept about family life has to change.

52
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,540
Of course the best thing you can do for your
family is to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, but

53
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,540
if you are sticking on to people because they're
your family, it's very dangerous.

54
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:42,790
Then there is second kind of a movement with
this behavior, that you start thinking about

55
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,410
your own city: "This is my city." You could
have been born anywhere. So: "My city. Mother,

56
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,690
You come to my city. Is important." It's like:
my home, my relations and my city. Then, my

57
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,779
country: "This is my country. Mother, You
must come to my country." I understand. Your

58
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:23,329
concern is good, it's patriotic, that you
are worried about other people in your own

59
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:28,949
country. But there should not be any attachment.
One should be detached, and detached in the

60
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:35,949
way, I would say, that just watch. Just watch
yourself and others. See for yourself, why

61
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,040
are you so much interested in your own country
or in your own capital? Why? Why is it? When

62
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:01,889
you ask this question you'll be surprised,
mostly you'll find: "Because I belong to this

63
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:08,889
place, I was born in this place, that's why
I want." Mostly; honest answer. But could

64
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:16,310
be that: "I want also that these people should
become Sahaja Yogis. It's easy for me because

65
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:23,310
I am from this place, I would like them to
be Sahaja Yogis." This is one of the basic

66
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:31,670
reasons why Sahaja Yoga does not spread, that
we get involved into pockets of our family

67
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,100
and we don't go across them to others. So
all our attention, all our behavior is completely

68
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:49,250
entangled into something which is not Sahaj.
So we have to go beyond and know that our

69
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:05,009
family is different. The whole world is our
family, so we have to move out. Don't get

70
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:13,639
stagnated or entangled with a small circle
of few people who are negative, but go beyond

71
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,589
them, because you've got the powers, you've
got everything. You can easily cross over

72
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:29,459
these barriers and see for yourself that you
are feeling now mentally very happy, physically

73
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:38,210
all right, and spiritually you are there.
In our Indian society people take to sanyasa.

74
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,520
They'll wear [SOUNDS LIKE "KASHAI"], go out,
many people after certain age take to sanyasa.

75
00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:01,399
Why not take the sanyasa inside just now?
What is the need to wait till you get old

76
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,500
and then absolutely haggard and then to say
that you are a sanyasi? Even anyway you are

77
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,500
a sanyasi at that time, but when you are young
you should develop this detachment, a clear-cut

78
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,610
detachment: that is, you are attached to Sahaja
Yoga and to nothing else. Nothing is more

79
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:36,560
important than Sahaja Yoga to you. Once we
decide that, then you move in that line and

80
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:46,169
you grow in that line very mildly, very well.
But supposing you get short-circuited and

81
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:54,210
move somewhere else, then how can there be
growth? It looks extremely simple to us: we

82
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,820
must help our relations, we must help all
other ones. To Indians it is very easy, it

83
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,820
happens to them very easily. But the Western
people are not like that. They will not go

84
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:20,290
about, wasting their energy about their relations
normally. They are worried about themselves,

85
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,290
and they want that they should achieve the
highest themselves.

86
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Now, once we take away our attention from
the family, you'll be surprised how this attention

87
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:52,659
works across the family, across this small
little wall that we have built. And you are

88
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:04,330
surprised how it expands, and how it gives
you all the blessings and all the grace of

89
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:17,710
Divine love. We always start thinking about
our relations, about how to be kind to them,

90
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,100
how to be nice to them. Or all these things,
all these behaviors of how to be nice to them,

91
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,040
how to be good to them and all that, can be
extended so much, can expand so much. As you

92
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,730
love them, as you care for them, as you are
attached to them, if you get attached to Sahaj

93
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,629
then the light will spread.

94
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:02,629
For example now, near Hyderabad there are
many small cities, small places, lots of them.

95
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:13,149
You can all take up one city or one small
little village or something. Go there and

96
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:20,350
talk about Sahaja Yoga. It will definitely
work out. That's how in England they have

97
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,700
worked it out, and in many other countries.
So I have to tell all the Sahaja Yogis who

98
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:37,929
are here in Hyderabad and who are also in
other places, like Vishakapatnam or Vijayawada

99
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:46,260
or anywhere; all of them should understand
that at least they can spread it in their

100
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,909
city, Sahaja Yoga, very fast, in case they
get detached from their family. I know of

101
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:59,909
certain Sahaja Yogis, their wives are so strong
at it that they cannot overcome even their

102
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:11,919
wives, leave alone other relations. We have
had an experience of such women. Specially

103
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,970
in India there is a rule that whatever is
the dharma of the husband, that a wife has

104
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:37,970
to follow. But still I've seen that even the
wives can be very powerful because they're

105
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:45,129
so assertive, so aggressive. And if the husband
is simple he has to suffer. So here I would

106
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,919
say that one should not succumb to anyone
because he's dominating or in any way assertive,

107
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,040
but stand back and tell that this is the dharma
we are following, and nobody has business

108
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,040
to check us. We are on a fundamental right,
doing it.

109
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:24,389
Now the question is about how we deal with
each other in Sahaja Yoga, how we live with

110
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,200
each other, how we talk to each other. What
is the net result? Do we have a complete rapport

111
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,440
with other Sahaja Yogis in the same city?
Do you invite them to your house as you would

112
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:06,540
invite your neighbors? In any matter whatsoever
pertaining to you, any matter whatsoever,

113
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:32,639
the relations have nothing to do with you.
That's how you will start getting detached

114
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:41,980
and not worrying about it.

115
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,980
Now here are the many Western Sahaja Yogis.
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN HINDI]. The description

116
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,020
I've given now of when people who are left-sided
actually, they have attachments of the left

117
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,679
side. The right side attachments are different
type, as you know very well. The first one

118
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:53,679
is that they are individualistic, they don't
like collectivity. They think it is a force

119
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:05,119
on them; it is a binding thing, so that they
cannot rise. Right-sided people have the biggest

120
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,080
problem is of ego, which is all the time sitting
like a snake, coiled up. Something goes wrong,

121
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,919
suddenly it comes up - Ha! and you see a snake
come up now. The snake is very springy. But

122
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:50,139
now with Sahaja Yoga it is getting intoxicated,
I think; it doesn't come up. So the attachments:

123
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:02,399
on what points do we get upset? We should
write it down. All right. For example, what

124
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,750
do I get upset with, Myself? When I see a
Sahaja Yogi becoming bhootish I get upset.

125
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,679
But you just try to find out: "When do I get
upset?" and you'll be surprised, most of those

126
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,679
things are out of Sahaja Yoga; they have nothing
to do with Sahaja Yoga. But you are very upset,

127
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:35,909
very angry, and you don't want to talk about
it.

128
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:43,179
So this attitude of mind has to be changed.
When you are set now in Sahaja Yoga, how can

129
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,700
you be upset? That means you are not set:
simple thing. You are now set in Sahaja Yoga.

130
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:05,770
So how can you be upset? A very common language
there is to say: "I hope you are not upset".

131
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,919
When you say somebody is upset, he's upset,
I mean, may be whether you hope or don't hope!

132
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,440
But we do not also consider how do we upset
others? We don't also find out the ways and

133
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,500
methods, how not to upset others. And even
the humor we have, if it is pinching humor,

134
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:49,179
if it is disturbing humor, if it is denouncing
humor, that can upset a person very much.

135
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:05,830
So what sort of language we speak, what sort
of communication we have, what sort of 
harm we do to people: you need not be hot-tempered,

136
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:24,859
your ego may not be seen, but it's the style,
very sly style of the ego, just to say something

137
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:33,139
horrible. Second way is of criticizing others
all the time: "This is not good, that is not

138
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:44,159
good, this not good." Who has asked you to
judge it? So you should not judge yourself,

139
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,520
at the same time you should not judge others
and punish them. In our day to day life we

140
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:07,750
have to develop a very sweet language, extremely
sweet. We have to work it out, actually work

141
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,770
it out, because even coming to Sahaja Yoga
still it lingers, certain things, and these

142
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:30,409
habits can be corrected very simply, very
easily. It belongs to the tongue, not to us,

143
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:42,429
so it's very easy to get rid of them.

144
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:50,839
The obstinacy is another thing which is a
horrible thing. Anybody suffers from this

145
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:58,399
kind of very subtle obstinacy; obstinacy [SOUNDS
LIKE "RESTS"], these things are tied down

146
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,280
with a rope. Now whatever may happen, you
are tied down: "Once I have decided, I have

147
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:16,500
decided." "But what is the harm in changing?"
"No, no, no, no; we don't want any change."

148
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:27,879
Now in Sahaja Yoga I'm happy, nothing is decided,
nothing is fixed. We were to have Puja, say,

149
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:36,399
yesterday; we'll have it today, that too in
the morning. It should not upset you because

150
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:48,450
it's all done to keep your upsetting you away.
So when is the program and when is not the

151
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:58,740
program is not important. What is important
is that how you have managed with that change.

152
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:08,179
If you do not know how to manage the change,
then your transformation is incomplete.

153
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:18,230
Now this English language I have learnt in
this lifetime, and I find there are some good

154
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:32,770
points about it, that you must say ten times:
"Thank you" even if somebody gives you water,

155
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:40,780
or fifteen times: "Sorry!" morning till evening.
In a way it is good, but if it's just a lip-service,

156
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,480
then everybody knows that you have to say
"Thank you", so they said "Thank you" so well.

157
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:57,079
But at the same time, if you remember how
graciously he did that for you, just remember

158
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:06,320
that. Next time you meet that person, all
this graciousness will come out, because you

159
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,320
get a feeling: somebody does something for
you, you get a beautiful feeling of gratitude.

160
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:21,550
And once you get that feeling, if you remember
that feeling, then you'll go on adding up

161
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:32,020
to it. [SHRI MATAJI SAYS, ASIDE: "I THINK
YOU ALSO SIT IN THE SUN, IS TOO MUCH HOT"].

162
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:40,089
It goes on adding. The more you add these
beautiful feelings within yourself: "How I

163
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:47,899
felt when they did it". Every time you get
some sort of a experience of that kind, if

164
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:57,099
you keep it within yourself, any time you
open that area of your memory, all the beauty

165
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:04,190
will start pouring on you, of that feeling.

166
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,780
So we have to learn new methods of making
ourselves happy. Before that we used to be

167
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,780
happy when we hurt others, we used to be happy
when we were sarcastic with others. But now

168
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:25,129
we have to develop a new method of making
ourselves happy; and once your mind goes on

169
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,589
to that: "I have to be happy, joyous. What
am I doing? Why am I doing like this? How

170
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:40,290
can I be happy? By saying a harsh thing to
others or by saying something mischievous,

171
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:47,290
how can I be happy? I cannot be." Then, "This
Mr. Ego, he makes me extremely unhappy. He's

172
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,720
really spoilt my mood." And you tell him to
get out now, get down, get down. Then it will

173
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,089
go down.

174
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:09,150
At this juncture when you are so advanced
in Sahaja Yoga, I should not have told all

175
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:16,150
these things to you; I agree with you entirely,
that now the time is not for telling you all

176
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:26,210
these things regarding your behavior toward
other Sahaja Yogis. But even a slightest movement

177
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:36,490
completely changes the atmosphere. So one
has to be extremely careful and attentive,

178
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,920
has to know what you say, what you have to
say, how you behave, and how you create a

179
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:06,940
feeling. In the society of Sahaja Yoga we
have beautiful people, we laugh, we enjoy,

180
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:13,940
we do all kinds of things, and really we are
in the most joyous company all the time. After

181
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,839
all it's joy, and what we achieve in joy is
the highest. At the same time we have to remember

182
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:40,589
that the collective subconscious is there,
and that may just jump sometime and come back.

183
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:48,099
Sahaja Yoga doesn't believe in any revenge,
hatred; nothing of the kind. It doesn't believe

184
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,560
in any kind of a false pride, or any kind
of restrictions or anything. It believes in

185
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:03,290
the pure sense of humanity and also the great
work of Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:27,410
It gives you great pleasure to be kind, to
be nice; so subside, to subside these habits

187
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,760
you have to do some abyas, you have to practise,
and introspect yourself. I am not saying because

188
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,800
anybody has reported anything that is like
that, nothing, in no way. But at this juncture

189
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:58,650
I am just telling you, because now when you
will be going out you'll be meeting new people,

190
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,400
then you might have problems, might have problems
of facing people whom you would be harsh,

191
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:27,430
you would be more meticulous, you may be much
more aggressive than normal. All these things

192
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
will upset, upset them; but if you are peaceful,
tolerant, forgiving, that will definitely

193
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,769
make them feel that you are saints. If they
are difficult leave them alone, don't argue,

194
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,960
by argument you cannot give them Realization.
If they don't have wisdom they don't deserve

195
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,960
it, they don't, they are not destined to be
like that. But your style has to be such that

196
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:18,750
they should know that you are saints. In all
your self-respect, in all your love you have

197
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,380
to talk to them.

198
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:28,380
So now when you are here in this country you
have to decide how 

199
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,900
you 

200
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:57,309
are going to spread Sahaja Yoga when you go
back. Same with our Indian Sahaja Yogis: they

201
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:39,460
have to 

202
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:25,049
also find out ways and methods, how they 

203
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:14,089
will 
spread 

204
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:44,279
Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:14,329
May 

206
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:56,859
God bless you.
