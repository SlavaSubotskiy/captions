1
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:34,191
We have today come to this famous place, Hyderabad,
which was ruled by Muslim kings, but they

2
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:48,000
were very Indian and they fought also for
the independence of India with the British.

3
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:10,231
You know about Tipu Sultan, who was also a
realized soul but he was killed.

4
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:23,551
We have in our country one very big problem
and that is, individually we are all great

5
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:32,920
people, but when it comes to collective we
don’t know how to live collectively, and

6
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:43,200
that is why we lost our independence.

7
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,290
Anybody can manage us.

8
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:59,810
If we can
open our eyes and see, it is quite easily

9
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:13,491
understood that when people try to talk ill
of others, involving us, there must be some

10
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:17,751
intention.

11
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:31,241
This has been our failing since long, that
people use such methods that they spoil the

12
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:36,891
relationships.

13
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:42,420
And this should not crawl into Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:55,081
When I am in India I think I should put some
light on our weaknesses also.

15
00:07:55,081 --> 00:08:02,461
The second weakness we have, that we are very
involved with our family; with our children,

16
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:08,891
with our parents, with our brothers, cousins,
this, that.

17
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:17,251
Till you are completely deceived or cheated
by someone so close, you’ll never learn

18
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,870
a lesson.

19
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,651
We are very involved; all our problems are
around them.

20
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:31,010
We cannot get out of our family.

21
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:37,871
All the time we start thinking that: “Sahaja
Yoga should help my family.

22
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:41,560
Sahaja Yoga should do this for my family."

23
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:53,751
In Sahaja Yoga there’s another family that
has nothing to do with your family.

24
00:08:53,751 --> 00:09:00,821
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis who are of
a very high level, and suddenly I find they

25
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:04,381
have gone down.

26
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:11,781
They have no reason to suffer in health or
in any way.

27
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:20,980
Then I find out that they’re attached to
some brother or someone who is doing some

28
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,851
other kind of guru business.

29
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:36,381
Instead of we influencing them, they start
influencing us.

30
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:47,731
So we have to really break our relationships
with all such people who are negative, because

31
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:53,451
we have had relations and relations and relations
all our lives.

32
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:57,091
What did we get out of them?

33
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:08,141
If we do not understand how important it is
to be a Sahaja Yogi, that you are the instrument

34
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,651
of God Almighty.

35
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:20,791
So many things you know that even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha did not know.

36
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,631
They didn’t know much about Kundalini.

37
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:28,391
They didn’t know how to raise the Kundalini.

38
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:31,641
They didn’t know how to give Realization,
except for gurus.

39
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:37,701
Out of them also you know that Janaka had
only one disciple.

40
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:44,701
All of them had one each.

41
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:52,701
So certain things you know are more than anybody
had known before.

42
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:59,641
But still if you are sticking on to your old
standards and old methods and confusing them

43
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:07,831
with Sahaja Yoga, identifying with them as
Sahaja Yoga, then your growth will be very

44
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:10,511
little.

45
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:14,411
So I have to tell you that, try to get out
of this.

46
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:16,870
“Who is my brother?

47
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:23,801
Who is my sister?”

48
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:31,661
Of course it’s a good thing to be attached,
in a way, to the duties that you have to perform

49
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:37,571
towards everyone, but all the duties should
be done in such a manner that you do not get

50
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:42,031
involved into it.

51
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:47,051
It is very important that you should not get
involved with those duties.

52
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:58,860
Whatever has to be done you should do, but
you shouldn’t worry as to the fruit of it.

53
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,331
Talking ill about others, saying things just
to spoil the relationship is sin, in Sahaja

54
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,331
Yoga.

55
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:13,240
Always talk good things about others.

56
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,361
For example, if somebody comes and tells Me
that such and such person is not good and

57
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,261
all that, I tell them lies.

58
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,541
I tell them: “That person was praising you
so much.

59
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:30,831
Why are you saying all these things against
that person?”

60
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:47,090
So it is important for Sahaja Yogis to create
a more synthesis, more coordination, more

61
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:55,090
combinations and more bringing in more and
more people.

62
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:01,701
But people get more attached to the negative
people than to the positive people.

63
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:11,901
That means still you are not in Sahaja Yoga
fully.

64
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:20,581
Once you start understanding this it would
be very, very clear-cut what you should do

65
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:25,651
and what you should not do as far as these
relationships are concerned.

66
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:32,831
I mean, in India it’s a common thing for
a minister to appoint his nephew, his son,

67
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:36,800
his wife, his grandson, even his servant into
some post.

68
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,451
It’s a common thing, whether they are capable
or not.

69
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,360
But in Sahaja Yoga you can’t do.

70
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,911
You have to be a Sahaja Yogi.

71
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:53,691
You can’t just get anybody because he’s
your relation and ask that: “Mother, see

72
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,441
now, he’s my relation.

73
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:59,190
Please help this man."

74
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,581
Why should God help people who are not Sahaja
Yogis?

75
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:15,471
He does not know them and He doesn’t want
to do it.

76
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:22,301
So our concept about family life has to change.

77
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:28,481
Of course the best thing you can do for your
family is to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, but

78
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:35,600
if you are sticking on to people because they’re
your family, it’s very dangerous.

79
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:46,211
Then there is second kind of a movement with
this behavior, that you start thinking about

80
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:51,641
your own city: “This is my city."

81
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,331
You could have been born anywhere.

82
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,951
So: “My city.

83
00:14:55,951 --> 00:15:00,821
Mother, You come to my city.

84
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:01,821
Is important."

85
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:06,951
It’s like: my home, my relations and my
city.

86
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:11,261
Then, my country: “This is my country.

87
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,271
Mother, You must come to my country."

88
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:15,181
I understand.

89
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:22,110
Your concern is good, it’s patriotic, that
you are worried about other people in your

90
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,191
own country.

91
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,981
But there should not be any attachment.

92
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:37,581
One should be detached, and detached in the
way, I would say, that just watch.

93
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,811
Just watch yourself and others.

94
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:52,641
See for yourself, why are you so much interested
in your own country or in your own capital?

95
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,641
Why?

96
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,341
Why is it?

97
00:15:55,341 --> 00:16:01,440
When you ask this question you’ll be surprised,
mostly you’ll find: “Because I belong

98
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,570
to this place, I was born in this place, that’s
why I want."

99
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,740
Mostly; honest answer.

100
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,481
But could be that: “I want also that these
people should become Sahaja Yogis.

101
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:23,141
It’s easy for me because I am from this
place, I would like them to be Sahaja Yogis."

102
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:29,151
This is one of the basic reasons why Sahaja
Yoga does not spread, that we get involved

103
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:37,600
into pockets of our family and we don’t
go across them to others.

104
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,480
So all our attention, all our behavior is
completely entangled into something which

105
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,051
is not Sahaj.

106
00:16:50,051 --> 00:17:00,011
So we have to go beyond and know that our
family is different.

107
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:05,551
The whole world is our family, so we have
to move out.

108
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:13,711
Don’t get stagnated or entangled with a
small circle of few people who are negative,

109
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:19,661
but go beyond them, because you’ve got the
powers, you’ve got everything.

110
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:28,132
You can easily cross over these barriers and
see for yourself that you are feeling now

111
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:38,451
mentally very happy, physically all right,
and spiritually you are there.

112
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:44,840
In our Indian society people take to sanyasa.

113
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,960
They’ll wear [SOUNDS LIKE “KASHAI”],
go out, many people after certain age take

114
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,201
to sanyasa.

115
00:17:54,201 --> 00:18:02,711
Why not take the sanyasa inside just now?

116
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:08,601
What is the need to wait till you get old
and then absolutely haggard and then to say

117
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,551
that you are a sanyasi?

118
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:19,971
Even anyway you are a sanyasi at that time,
but when you are young you should develop

119
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:25,960
this detachment, a clear-cut detachment: that
is, you are attached to Sahaja Yoga and to

120
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,340
nothing else.

121
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,871
Nothing is more important than Sahaja Yoga
to you.

122
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:42,440
Once we decide that, then you move in that
line and you grow in that line very mildly,

123
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,371
very well.

124
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:53,200
But supposing you get short-circuited and
move somewhere else, then how can there be

125
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,921
growth?

126
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:02,751
It looks extremely simple to us: we must help
our relations, we must help all other ones.

127
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:06,580
To Indians it is very easy, it happens to
them very easily.

128
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,251
But the Western people are not like that.

129
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:17,661
They will not go about, wasting their energy
about their relations normally.

130
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:31,371
They are worried about themselves, and they
want that they should achieve the highest

131
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,041
themselves.

132
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:44,781
Now, once we take away our attention from
the family, you’ll be surprised how this

133
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:56,560
attention works across the family, across
this small little wall that we have built.

134
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:09,491
And you are surprised how it expands, and
how it gives you all the blessings and all

135
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,391
the grace of Divine love.

136
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:24,190
We always start thinking about our relations,
about how to be kind to them, how to be nice

137
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,190
to them.

138
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:33,481
Or all these things, all these behaviors of
how to be nice to them, how to be good to

139
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:45,141
them and all that, can be extended so much,
can expand so much.

140
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:50,661
As you love them, as you care for them, as
you are attached to them, if you get attached

141
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:57,560
to Sahaj then the light will spread.

142
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:05,971
For example now, near Hyderabad there are
many small cities, small places, lots of them.

143
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:11,961
You can all take up one city or one small
little village or something.

144
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:16,210
Go there and talk about Sahaja Yoga.

145
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,391
It will definitely work out.

146
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:27,441
That’s how in England they have worked it
out, and in many other countries.

147
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:35,771
So I have to tell all the Sahaja Yogis who
are here in Hyderabad and who are also in

148
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:43,051
other places, like Vishakapatnam or Vijayawada
or anywhere; all of them should understand

149
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:51,491
that at least they can spread it in their
city, Sahaja Yoga, very fast, in case they

150
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:52,671
get detached from their family.

151
00:21:52,671 --> 00:22:04,190
I know of certain Sahaja Yogis, their wives
are so strong at it that they cannot overcome

152
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,891
even their wives, leave alone other relations.

153
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:19,001
We have had an experience of such women.

154
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:30,521
Specially in India there is a rule that whatever
is the dharma of the husband, that a wife

155
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,771
has to follow.

156
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:38,281
But still I’ve seen that even the wives
can be very powerful because they’re so

157
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:42,551
assertive, so aggressive.

158
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:50,051
And if the husband is simple he has to suffer.

159
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:57,691
So here I would say that one should not succumb
to anyone because he’s dominating or in

160
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:03,791
any way assertive, but stand back and tell
that this is the dharma we are following,

161
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,931
and nobody has business to check us.

162
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:17,201
We are on a fundamental right, doing it.

163
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:29,461
Now the question is about how we deal with
each other in Sahaja Yoga, how we live with

164
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:36,081
each other, how we talk to each other.

165
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,151
What is the net result?

166
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:51,291
Do we have a complete rapport with other Sahaja
Yogis in the same city?

167
00:23:51,291 --> 00:24:10,421
Do you invite them to your house as you would
invite your neighbors?

168
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:26,571
In any matter whatsoever pertaining to you,
any matter whatsoever, the relations have

169
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:30,201
nothing to do with you.

170
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:43,171
That’s how you will start getting detached
and not worrying about it.

171
00:24:43,171 --> 00:25:10,831
Now here are the many Western Sahaja Yogis.

172
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:28,401
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN HINDI].

173
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:38,991
The description I’ve given now of when people
who are left-sided actually, they have attachments

174
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,271
of the left side.

175
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:45,731
The right side attachments are different type,
as you know very well.

176
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:55,121
The first one is that they are individualistic,
they don’t like collectivity.

177
00:25:55,121 --> 00:26:13,111
They think it is a force on them; it is a
binding thing, so that they cannot rise.

178
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:20,341
Right-sided people have the biggest problem
is of ego, which is all the time sitting like

179
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:24,830
a snake, coiled up.

180
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:32,671
Something goes wrong, suddenly it comes up
– Ha! and you see a snake come up now.

181
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:42,821
The snake is very springy.

182
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:54,121
But now with Sahaja Yoga it is getting intoxicated,
I think; it doesn’t come up.

183
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:58,141
So the attachments: on what points do we get
upset?

184
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,281
We should write it down.

185
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:01,341
All right.

186
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:07,291
For example, what do I get upset with, Myself?

187
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:14,840
When I see a Sahaja Yogi becoming bhootish
I get upset.

188
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,051
But you just try to find out: “When do I
get upset?” and you’ll be surprised, most

189
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:27,071
of those things are out of Sahaja Yoga; they
have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:35,981
But you are very upset, very angry, and you
don’t want to talk about it.

191
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:41,181
So this attitude of mind has to be changed.

192
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:48,481
When you are set now in Sahaja Yoga, how can
you be upset?

193
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:53,221
That means you are not set: simple thing.

194
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:58,571
You are now set in Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:00,631
So how can you be upset?

196
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:09,801
A very common language there is to say: “I
hope you are not upset”.

197
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:17,791
When you say somebody is upset, he’s upset,
I mean, may be whether you hope or don’t

198
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,791
hope!

199
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:24,791
But we do not also consider how do we upset
others?

200
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:34,731
We don’t also find out the ways and methods,
how not to upset others.

201
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:45,191
And even the humor we have, if it is pinching
humor, if it is disturbing humor, if it is

202
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:58,641
denouncing humor, that can upset a person
very much.

203
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:10,241
So what sort of language we speak, what sort
of communication we have, what sort of

204
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:21,371
harm we do to people: you need not be hot-tempered,
your ego may not be seen, but it’s the style,

205
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:31,271
very sly style of the ego, just to say something
horrible.

206
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:37,311
Second way is of criticizing others all the
time: “This is not good, that is not good,

207
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:40,200
this not good."

208
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,621
Who has asked you to judge it?

209
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:53,661
So you should not judge yourself, at the same
time you should not judge others and punish

210
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,681
them.

211
00:29:54,681 --> 00:30:07,971
In our day to day life we have to develop
a very sweet language, extremely sweet.

212
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:16,701
We have to work it out, actually work it out,
because even coming to Sahaja Yoga still it

213
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:26,971
lingers, certain things, and these habits
can be corrected very simply, very easily.

214
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:43,641
It belongs to the tongue, not to us, so it’s
very easy to get rid of them.

215
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:49,621
The obstinacy is another thing which is a
horrible thing.

216
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:59,021
Anybody suffers from this kind of very subtle
obstinacy; obstinacy [SOUNDS LIKE “RESTS”],

217
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:03,001
these things are tied down with a rope.

218
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:12,231
Now whatever may happen, you are tied down:
“Once I have decided, I have decided."

219
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:15,421
“But what is the harm in changing?”

220
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:20,671
“No, no, no, no; we don’t want any change."

221
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:27,601
Now in Sahaja Yoga I’m happy, nothing is
decided, nothing is fixed.

222
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:35,700
We were to have Puja, say, yesterday; we’ll
have it today, that too in the morning.

223
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:47,001
It should not upset you because it’s all
done to keep your upsetting you away.

224
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:52,881
So when is the program and when is not the
program is not important.

225
00:31:52,881 --> 00:32:00,981
What is important is that how you have managed
with that change.

226
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:12,491
If you do not know how to manage the change,
then your transformation is incomplete.

227
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:25,581
Now this English language I have learnt in
this lifetime, and I find there are some good

228
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:31,972
points about it, that you must say ten times:
“Thank you” even if somebody gives you

229
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:37,021
water, or fifteen times: “Sorry!” morning
till evening.

230
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:43,991
In a way it is good, but if it’s just a
lip-service, then everybody knows that you

231
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:49,891
have to say “Thank you”, so they said
“Thank you” so well.

232
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:59,241
But at the same time, if you remember how
graciously he did that for you, just remember

233
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,241
that.

234
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:07,391
Next time you meet that person, all this graciousness
will come out, because you get a feeling:

235
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:14,361
somebody does something for you, you get a
beautiful feeling of gratitude.

236
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:24,820
And once you get that feeling, if you remember
that feeling, then you’ll go on adding up

237
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
to it.

238
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:32,911
[SHRI MATAJI SAYS, ASIDE: “I THINK YOU ALSO
SIT IN THE SUN, IS TOO MUCH HOT”].

239
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,090
It goes on adding.

240
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:43,001
The more you add these beautiful feelings
within yourself: “How I felt when they did

241
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,001
it”.

242
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:52,081
Every time you get some sort of a experience
of that kind, if you keep it within yourself,

243
00:33:52,081 --> 00:34:00,210
any time you open that area of your memory,
all the beauty will start pouring on you,

244
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,991
of that feeling.

245
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:08,761
So we have to learn new methods of making
ourselves happy.

246
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:15,920
Before that we used to be happy when we hurt
others, we used to be happy when we were sarcastic

247
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,511
with others.

248
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:28,350
But now we have to develop a new method of
making ourselves happy; and once your mind

249
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,381
goes on to that: “I have to be happy, joyous.

250
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:33,381
What am I doing?

251
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:34,381
Why am I doing like this?

252
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:36,640
How can I be happy?

253
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,801
By saying a harsh thing to others or by saying
something mischievous, how can I be happy?

254
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:43,390
I cannot be."

255
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,910
Then, “This Mr.

256
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,491
Ego, he makes me extremely unhappy.

257
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:53,241
He’s really spoilt my mood."

258
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,690
And you tell him to get out now, get down,
get down.

259
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:02,890
Then it will go down.

260
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:10,171
At this juncture when you are so advanced
in Sahaja Yoga, I should not have told all

261
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:19,011
these things to you; I agree with you entirely,
that now the time is not for telling you all

262
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:26,751
these things regarding your behavior toward
other Sahaja Yogis.

263
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:38,181
But even a slightest movement completely changes
the atmosphere.

264
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:47,991
So one has to be extremely careful and attentive,
has to know what you say, what you have to

265
00:35:47,991 --> 00:36:03,140
say, how you behave, and how you create a
feeling.

266
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,771
In the society of Sahaja Yoga we have beautiful
people, we laugh, we enjoy, we do all kinds

267
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:19,441
of things, and really we are in the most joyous
company all the time.

268
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:30,231
After all it’s joy, and what we achieve
in joy is the highest.

269
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:37,231
At the same time we have to remember that
the collective subconscious is there, and

270
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:41,021
that may just jump sometime and come back.

271
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:48,041
Sahaja Yoga doesn’t believe in any revenge,
hatred; nothing of the kind.

272
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:53,711
It doesn’t believe in any kind of a false
pride, or any kind of restrictions or anything.

273
00:36:53,711 --> 00:37:20,221
It believes in the pure sense of humanity
and also the great work of Sahaja Yoga.

274
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:33,561
It gives you great pleasure to be kind, to
be nice; so subside, to subside these habits

275
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:41,421
you have to do some abyas, you have to practise,
and introspect yourself.

276
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:47,461
I am not saying because anybody has reported
anything that is like that, nothing, in no

277
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,031
way.

278
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:58,301
But at this juncture I am just telling you,
because now when you will be going out you’ll

279
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:16,350
be meeting new people, then you might have
problems, might have problems of facing people

280
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:29,831
whom you would be harsh, you would be more
meticulous, you may be much more aggressive

281
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:38,021
than normal.

282
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:50,990
All these things will upset, upset them; but
if you are peaceful, tolerant, forgiving,

283
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,361
that will definitely make them feel that you
are saints.

284
00:38:56,361 --> 00:39:00,350
If they are difficult leave them alone, don’t
argue, by argument you cannot give them Realization.

285
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:07,241
If they don’t have wisdom they don’t deserve
it, they don’t, they are not destined to

286
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,321
be like that.

287
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:15,811
But your style has to be such that they should
know that you are saints.

288
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:21,181
In all your self-respect, in all your love
you have to talk to them.

289
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:26,561
So now when you are here in this country you
have to decide how you are going to spread

290
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:30,271
Sahaja Yoga when you go back.

291
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:37,521
Same with our Indian Sahaja Yogis: they have
to also find out ways and methods, how they

292
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,880
will spread Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,231
May God bless you.
