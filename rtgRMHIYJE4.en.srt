1
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:25,821
I’m sorry for being late but I have been
working, I tell you, since morning.

2
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:36,507
Now, today we are here to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:43,608
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest
significance for all the Sahaj Yogis.

4
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:48,711
And we have to understand that He
resurrected Himself

5
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:52,253
so that we could resurrect ourselves.

6
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:58,252
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

7
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:04,202
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

8
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:07,684
I see lots of people having this drama
going on:

9
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:11,528
they are carrying the cross across

10
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,294
to show as if we are going to do the job
for Christ!

11
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:20,641
As if He has left some work to be done
by these people who play a drama.

12
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:25,368
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

13
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:34,830
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

14
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:39,266
To make you weep and to make you cry,
Christ did not suffer.

15
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,467
He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy,

16
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:49,504
that you should lead a life of complete
bliss and gratitude

17
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:52,478
to the Almighty who has created you.

18
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,362
He would never like you to be unhappy.

19
00:02:55,563 --> 00:03:00,063
Which father would like his son to be
unhappy?

20
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:06,294
So we have to understand that His message
of His life,

21
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:12,720
why He came on this Earth to do the
greatest job is that of resurrection.

22
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:18,045
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

23
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:22,119
So we have to be eternally thankful
to His life and to Him,

24
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,903
the way He did all these difficult tasks,
taking upon Himself.

25
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,330
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

26
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:36,833
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om,

27
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:43,318
He being the Logos, He being the Brahma
could do it.

28
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:47,003
But now you all have ascended.

29
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:52,539
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

30
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,964
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

31
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:02,486
He’s there within us, in our hearts,
in our eyes,

32
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:08,002
and He has resurrected Himself and
He has resurrected you, too.

33
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:12,154
But now it is for you to resurrect other
people.

34
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:16,579
You can resurrect other people, this is
the power you have got it

35
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:20,080
through Him, maybe, or through your
Kundalini.

36
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,708
But you have this power to resurrect other
people,

37
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:28,021
but first and foremost thing [is] you have
to be strong like Christ:

38
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:35,231
how He obeyed His Mother and how He
obeyed all the demands of His life.

39
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:42,118
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

40
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,734
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side

41
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,544
or to become some sort of a big officer

42
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:53,540
or to become another great rider,
or a swimmer,

43
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:58,626
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing
like that.

44
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:04,901
He didn’t try all these tricks, and didn’t
try to hanker after all these things

45
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:10,394
that sometimes make us quite mad.

46
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:22,636
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself,

47
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:27,553
as the Divine vibrations itself, which He
established.

48
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:34,464
And what you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people,

49
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:39,456
as the realised souls, as the Sahaj Yogis.

50
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,704
And this is going to be very easy.

51
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:47,407
Now everything is made easy for you:
your realisation,

52
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:55,279
then your powers, everything has
beautifully settled within you.

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,662
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly
and steadily.

54
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:09,511
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something

55
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:13,255
or have compelled you to do something.

56
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:18,179
But through your own ascent you can see
what’s wrong with you

57
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,452
or with the people about whom we are
talking.

58
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:31,224
And then you can also know through all
these powers whatever is to be known.

59
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:35,597
All that is unknown can be your own,
everything.

60
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:40,593
But the attention should be towards your
ascent, towards the state.

61
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:45,559
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

62
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,920
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

63
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:55,121
It is a state. It’s a state of your
personality.

64
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,306
And there where I always say…

65
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:02,854
Excuse me, I think I’ll... The sun is
showing its results.

66
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,044
See how the sun listens to me!

67
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:08,583
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

68
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:13,609
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

69
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:17,530
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

70
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,941
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me,

71
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:40,179
so I better tell!

72
00:07:53,154 --> 00:08:00,216
They have been telling for the last one
year, you see,

73
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:04,818
we’ve been thinking of coming here
for this puja.

74
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,886
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here,

75
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:13,238
but the dates were not very suitable,

76
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,344
because those days the moon would be
waning.

77
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:19,199
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

78
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,504
We have to have the moon there.
It’s important.”

79
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:26,547
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometimes
later.”

80
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:31,553
And suddenly it happened that I had to come
here: luckily I was here.

81
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:35,469
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling

82
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:41,536
that it’s going to rain heavily, it’s going
to be very clouded

83
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,748
and the temperature is going to be very bad

84
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:51,422
and it’s going to be very, very heavy
rains.

85
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:08,240
And again and again, every night, every
time

86
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:13,939
they announced about the weather it was
looking even worse, every time.

87
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:19,340
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

88
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,442
If you ask the clouds to move out

89
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:31,870
you have to have a tremendous breeze
and that may spoil your tent.

90
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,390
So somehow or other, you see,

91
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:40,510
I just told the clouds that, “You’d better
move on to Newfoundland,

92
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:47,166
slowly, steadily, not with great speed.”
And they did it.

93
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:52,345
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

94
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,519
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

95
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:03,077
So beautiful it was. And you were all
asleep but I was awake, very early.

96
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,965
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

97
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,496
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

98
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:19,110
How obedient, how dedicated, how
beautiful!”

99
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:22,543
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,

100
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:27,842
you have to have proper light, you have
to have proper temperature.

101
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,792
So look at the sky! Look at everything!

102
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:34,810
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

103
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:40,212
It’s beautiful! It became pink, beautifully
pink, and then now it’s shining.

104
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:47,132
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

105
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:52,846
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

106
00:10:54,531 --> 00:11:06,193
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya
chakra.

107
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:11,557
Christ resides in the Sun.

108
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:20,390
And in the body, in the being, He is
the Spirit.

109
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:23,038
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

110
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:27,656
And when He acts on the Agnya, He’s
the Sun.

111
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:32,623
Now we have seen in His life

112
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:38,583
that He was absolutely spotlessly
immaculate.

113
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:46,869
He had no defects in Him. He was
a perfect personality.

114
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:51,393
“Then why did He want to resurrect?”, one
can ask.

115
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:55,920
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

116
00:11:56,121 --> 00:12:03,541
His resurrection is like making the way
through the Agnya chakra

117
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:07,432
for all of you to pass through it.

118
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:12,135
He was like the gate, or we should say
He was the One

119
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:16,767
who opened the gate for all of
you.

120
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:20,735
Because He was so perfect,

121
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:25,758
He had no problems as we have of our
chakras, our Kundalini.

122
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:34,546
He had no problems. But He was
the complete compassion

123
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:43,249
in the nature of vibrations: the vibrations
became complete compassion.

124
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,392
So much so that even when He was
resurrected

125
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:52,169
and even before that when He was crucified

126
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:59,996
He said that, “Oh, God, the Father, please
forgive those people

127
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,969
because they do not know what they
are doing.‎”

128
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,016
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

129
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:10,905
And the Mother had to watch all that,
keeping quiet,

130
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:16,291
because that was the game, that was
the thing one had to do.

131
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:20,209
He had to play His game and He played it
so well.

132
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,262
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing:

133
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:31,465
that He has done all this for us, now what
are we going to do for Him?

134
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,167
He is the pattern we have to follow.

135
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:37,044
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow,

136
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:42,656
then it’s not that we carry the cross
on our shoulder.

137
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,961
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

138
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:48,095
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

139
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,192
Anybody can carry the cross!

140
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:58,364
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

141
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,345
What is so great about it?

142
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:05,753
What is so great in carrying a cross
on your shoulder?

143
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:10,798
It’s nothing something great. Any wrestler
can do it, anybody can do it.

144
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:15,193
That’s not the point! The point is we have
to carry

145
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:20,684
the work of Christ, of resurrection.
That is what we have to realise.

146
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:26,629
We have to understand the importance
of our being, of our lives,

147
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,967
like Christ understood that He has come
for this great job here.

148
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:34,316
And though He came as a human being,

149
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:39,030
though He came as an ordinary son
of an ordinary carpenter.

150
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:44,623
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings,

151
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:48,695
still He knew what He had to do,

152
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:52,304
He knew what He had to achieve and He
achieved it.

153
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:55,492
I think His was the most difficult task,

154
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:59,055
which He achieved and which He
furnished it, so well,

155
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,748
that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

156
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:07,478
Now let us see if we have done something
for Sahaj Yoga or not.

157
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,464
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

158
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:14,353
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

159
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:18,036
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry

160
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:22,072
the luggage of people downward, they are
carrying the cross of Christ.

161
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:23,590
That’s not the way!

162
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,857
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

163
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:34,563
And that seriousness is: how far we have
achieved that state,

164
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,945
for that what have we done?

165
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:40,155
And a simple thing I have been asking
all of you:

166
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,979
you have to meditate every day!

167
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,576
All of you have to meditate everyday.

168
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:52,819
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

169
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,837
We are having these watches just to know
that we have to meditate,

170
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:02,355
not for anything else. Our lives are
for meditation.

171
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:07,930
You need not spend all your twenty-four
hours, but you have to meditate!

172
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:13,082
Everyday you must meditate. If you
meditate your children will meditate.

173
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:18,237
And meditation is such a simple thing
for you, made so easy

174
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,700
that all the elements you can see work
it out.

175
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,911
All your chakras are made of different
elements

176
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:29,613
and when you clear out with the different
style —

177
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:33,396
I mean, you know all the methods and
the techniques of Sahaj Yoga —

178
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:37,604
with that when you clear out the chakras,
when you clear them out

179
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:46,180
you are absolutely free, absolutely at that
stage where you have to be.

180
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,639
But if you do not do this much even —
is to meditate —

181
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,425
it’s going to be very, very difficult
for me and for you

182
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:59,492
to achieve, for which you have come
on this Earth.

183
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:03,649
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that,

184
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,655
but I know how to do it, and you also
know how to do it.

185
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:14,001
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

186
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:18,025
Now, by now you must have realised,
all these so-called religions

187
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:23,130
in anybody’s name: whether it is in the
name of Islam, in the name of Christianity,

188
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:29,905
in the name of Hinduism, in the name
of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

189
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:34,151
It has no truth in it.

190
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:38,201
They have all tried to use it for their
own purposes.

191
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:44,087
There’s only one truth and that is:
all these great prophets

192
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:48,877
and all these great incarnations came
on this Earth for your ascent

193
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:55,051
and not for establishing those religions
who are just interested in money.

194
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,040
In these religions also you will find
there are people

195
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,249
who are either left-sided or right-sided.

196
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,025
There are some religions which preach
you should be very, very strict:

197
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,842
you should not do this, you should not
do that,

198
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:11,405
you should not drink, you should not smoke.

199
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:15,314
There are some who say you should not
marry, you should not look at women,

200
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,905
you should not look at men — all kinds
of restrictions.

201
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:23,638
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised,
there are so many restrictions.

202
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:31,497
If you see the amount of superstitions
that exist

203
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:35,933
and that are created by brahmins in India
you will be shocked.

204
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,011
For everything there’s a superstition:

205
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:41,322
if you walk with the left hand ahead,
that means this,

206
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:44,363
if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this;

207
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,941
if you sit like this, that means that.
Everything!

208
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:52,481
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

209
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,976
All kinds of absurdities there are
in Islam, too.

210
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,431
But when we find them in a free place
like England,

211
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:04,482
where there’s complete left-sidedness,
where you can do what you like

212
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:07,549
but still you are a Christian: if you
drink, it’s all right;

213
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,232
if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

214
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:17,918
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

215
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,283
So there’s nothing, especially for
the Protestants –

216
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:28,243
that’s the religion I was born in, where
everything is allowed.

217
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:32,150
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is,

218
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:35,022
then, comes to, that, if you ask them
the road,

219
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:40,187
they’ll tell you which way to go — that’s
Christianity. It’s coming to that end.

220
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,988
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into the Right Side

221
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,871
or onto the Left Side.

222
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:51,832
Some people like the Left Side and some
people like the Right Side.

223
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:55,263
I will tell you the story of a priest,
I went to see him in Russia.

224
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:58,754
I think I have told it to some people
before.

225
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:04,522
I went to Russia and the Russian people
asked me, “What would you like to see?”

226
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:07,687
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

227
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:10,414
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church.”

228
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:15,783
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, you see,

229
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:20,208
and a Black Order, which is supposed to be
the highest. I don’t know how they call it.

230
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:25,959
So we went inside and the priest said,
“All right, today I’m sorry,

231
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,174
we cannot offer you meat because our
fasting is there. But we’ll have lunch.”

232
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,425
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and
all that.

233
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,908
But the priest was only busy drinking,
because it was a fasting,

234
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,479
so drinking is allowed, according to them.

235
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,854
So he was drinking and drinking and
drinking.

236
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:45,120
He drank so much that he forgot that
we were there!

237
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:48,991
We were supposed to be VIPs, you see:
just lost himself into drinking!

238
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:52,493
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat, you see.

239
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:57,049
So we got up and walked out of that place

240
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,011
and this fellow didn’t even come
to wish us.

241
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:02,173
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink,

242
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,903
and didn’t do anything, and they were
laughing and laughing.

243
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:06,976
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

244
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,996
That’s why we didn’t want to take
to Christianity.”

245
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:13,148
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ.”

246
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:16,955
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

247
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,774
I said, “It’s not.”

248
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:23,394
Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed
to be

249
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:28,578
the highest person in spirituality living
in Russia!

250
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,908
So they have told me a story about
the tzars.

251
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:35,603
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought,

252
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:40,011
“Everybody’s having a religion, we have
no religion. Must have some religion.”

253
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:44,340
So they sent for some people

254
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,813
and the people who came forward were
Catholics to begin with.

255
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:53,341
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion.”

256
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,154
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

257
00:21:56,355 --> 00:22:02,422
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife.”

258
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,645
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

259
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:07,744
We have to have many tsarinas, you see,
for different purposes.

260
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:11,983
So we can’t have that religion!”
So they cancelled it.

261
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:16,213
So then the Islam: you see that time
I think they were no hindus available,

262
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:18,876
thank God!

263
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,335
They had the Islam, Islam people went,
and the Islamic people said,

264
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:27,750
“No, all right, you can have five wives,
it’s all right,

265
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:34,148
but you cannot drink.” They said,
“That’s impossible!

266
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:39,145
How can we follow Islam? That’s not
possible!” So, cancel it!

267
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,195
So these orthodox people — orthodox,
you see,

268
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,802
the word orthodox remember that — they
came.

269
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:47,802
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

270
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:51,242
We don’t mind if you drink,

271
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:54,224
we don’t mind if you have many wives,
we don’t mind.

272
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:57,098
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

273
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,612
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

274
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,360
And that’s how they had this religion
there.

275
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,292
So this is the situation of the religion
today.

276
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:17,573
All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good for nothing.

277
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:21,657
So now the inner religion within us is
the Sahaja dharma,

278
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,851
which has to be fully followed.

279
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:30,768
Now, I told, say in India, that now you
are all become Sahajas.

280
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:38,160
The story is like this, that there was
a villager who became Christian.

281
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:42,876
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian.

282
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:45,057
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name

283
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,443
because now I am Saheb, you see, I have
become an English man.

284
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,139
So you better give me a big name.”
They said, “What name you want?”

285
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,848
He said, “Give me the name of Alexander
the Great!”

286
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,856
So they called him Alexander. But his name
was Blondie, you see.

287
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:04,024
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they
called him Alexander Bhoora.

288
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:07,210
So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad

289
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,408
and went to the River Ganges for having
his bath.

290
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:14,616
So the priest said, the pastor, he said,
“You can’t do that!”

291
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:17,082
He said, “Why? Why can’t I do that?”

292
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,871
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges

293
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,020
because the Christianity will drop out,
you see!”

294
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,206
If he goes and has a bath in the River
Ganges.

295
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,249
He said, “This you can’t do!”

296
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,629
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb,

297
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,951
I have become an Englishman, that doesn’t
mean I have given up my religion!”

298
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:41,030
You see! This is exactly what is happening
to us

299
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:44,783
when we try to follow any religion
whatsoever.

300
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:50,701
Now we are all identified with our
so-called religions in which we were born.

301
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:55,421
For example, if I told Indians, “Now,
you don’t go to temples!

302
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:59,561
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple,

303
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:04,223
unless and until you have told me, don’t go
to a swayambhu temple at any cost.”

304
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:11,752
There are many churches also where there
are very good statues, we can say,

305
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:17,150
or have got something which are really
swayambhus, but they are very few.

306
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,431
So you tell me and then go. But they
wouldn’t listen to me,

307
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:25,472
they won’t listen, and when they go there
they catch on their Agnyas.

308
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:31,376
Once I went to see one temple which was
of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt,

309
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:35,416
so some Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

310
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,824
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

311
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:40,663
When they came back, as soon as they
saw me, they all fainted.

312
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,602
I said, “What happened? Where did you go?”
“Oh, we went to this temple.”

313
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:48,977
I said, “Why? You never told me. And what
do you have here?”

314
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:52,490
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka
(bindi) and it’s finished!

315
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:55,239
Then it took them one month to clear out!

316
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,074
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

317
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,763
Same with the Christians:

318
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:07,270
now the other day I heard about the Paris
episode

319
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:14,613
where people wanted to have weddings
in the church, in Paris.

320
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,817
So they must have special dresses!

321
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:22,203
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from… what shop is that?

322
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,619
I forgot the name, some big name.

323
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,168
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

324
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:37,029
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

325
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,751
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

326
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:45,522
What has happened is that in the church
there are many dead bodies buried,

327
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:47,662
and they are all caught up.

328
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:52,650
So when you go also to see the beautiful
architecture,

329
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:58,812
go with a detached mind. Don’t think
that you belong to that church.

330
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:02,071
You don’t belong to any church. You don’t
belong to any temple.

331
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,783
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

332
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:13,602
And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion.

333
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:22,520
He didn’t follow any religion. He followed
His own spiritual religion.

334
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:25,688
When He went to one church where there
were people who were discussing,

335
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,825
I mean they were Jews, He went there
and He was talking to them.

336
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:35,626
The other day I saw a beautiful painting
they had given on the newspaper,

337
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:40,640
a very beautiful famous painting where
Christ is talking to the doctors

338
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:49,786
and He is holding His, rubbing His Left
Swadhishthana, very nicely,

339
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:53,023
and all the doctors, you see, one of them
is listening to Him,

340
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:55,517
one of them is looking at Him, sneering
at Him,

341
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:57,912
another one is little bit paying attention
to Him.

342
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:02,923
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

343
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:06,301
It’s clearly [shown]. You can see it
so clearly!

344
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:10,735
And so now, with these new achievements,
you must rise above all these things

345
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:16,619
and you must understand that we have to be
very independently looking at ourselves.

346
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,758
We are no more belonging to any religion.

347
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:26,423
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

348
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:29,728
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread

349
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,264
only when you really become nothing
but Sahaj.

350
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:37,998
But that’s something I don’t understand —
it doesn’t work out.

351
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:43,674
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called

352
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:50,593
‘Hamaty’ or something who was supposed
to be an incarnation or something.

353
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:55,329
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner

354
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:01,562
that you can’t believe it: how ardently
they believe in this man.

355
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:06,158
Whatever he says, whatever he does,
how they believe in him.

356
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,181
It’s very surprising.

357
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:14,500
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone,

358
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:18,841
you’ll be surprised the way they are
fanatic about this fellow

359
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:22,258
and they will not hear anything against.
Leave alone that,

360
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:27,664
but if he says, “You stand on your head
for the whole night,” they will do it!

361
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:32,457
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it,

362
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:36,343
and when we know the truth, this is
the truth,

363
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:42,462
then we take advantage and we try
to compromise.

364
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:48,608
We think the truth will not do anything
about it.

365
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,736
Not that truth will punish you, it will
not,

366
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:55,183
because you are realised souls. It will
not.

367
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:58,570
It will not punish you up to a point.

368
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:06,076
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely
working at the same time.

369
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:08,214
If we do anything wrong,

370
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:12,853
like these people went to the church,
they were all caught up.

371
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:16,617
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

372
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:19,624
We are Sahaj Yogis.”

373
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:25,238
Because you are vulnerable, you are
vulnerable.

374
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,614
Yet you have not reached that stage.

375
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:30,801
If you reach that stage, then when you
go there,

376
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:35,773
all the church people will come out
of the church and run away.

377
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:39,315
They’ll start shaking before you.

378
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:41,184
They will not know what has happened.

379
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:44,028
I have seen when I enter into any church

380
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:47,388
all the candles start going chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,

381
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:50,115
and people start wondering what has
happened.

382
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:54,622
Even when they are having a dinner or
something and there is a candlelight dinner

383
00:30:54,823 --> 00:31:00,451
I am surprised the way every candle starts
flickering and people start looking.

384
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,225
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see,

385
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:08,404
so the candles immediately show that
these are the bhoots sitting here.

386
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:13,159
With all this knowledge that you have,
the light you have within yourself,

387
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,891
by which you are enlightened, still if you
are going

388
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:20,608
to these left and right-sided things,
it’s very, very dangerous.

389
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:27,763
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

390
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:31,320
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

391
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,692
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

392
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,854
The left-sided theories are democratic,

393
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,914
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

394
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,344
It’s the individual that is important.

395
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:44,903
The individual indulges into everything

396
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:49,335
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

397
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:52,505
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

398
00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:55,675
to do what he likes.

399
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:59,616
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

400
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:06,398
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

401
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:11,333
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

402
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:17,058
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

403
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:21,221
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

404
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:26,843
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

405
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:31,787
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

406
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:36,990
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

407
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:42,090
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

408
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:47,031
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

409
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:51,818
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

410
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:56,358
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

411
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,544
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

412
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:03,673
that the people who come from communist
countries,

413
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:07,713
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

414
00:33:07,914 --> 00:33:12,307
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

415
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:15,402
can drink more than even sardarjees.

416
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:20,118
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

417
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,420
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

418
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:29,807
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

419
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:35,733
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

420
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:40,342
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

421
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:47,351
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

422
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:51,902
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

423
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:54,553
So the individuals are weak in that case.

424
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:58,608
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

425
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:04,543
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

426
00:34:04,744 --> 00:34:06,926
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

427
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:10,293
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

428
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:15,780
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

429
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:18,865
has no power to bear them.

430
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:24,817
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

431
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:30,895
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

432
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:37,315
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

433
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:42,186
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

434
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:45,633
this is the ascent through the central
path -

435
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:54,619
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

436
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,897
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

437
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,811
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

438
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:10,087
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

439
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:16,945
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

440
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:25,430
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

441
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:29,219
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

442
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,004
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

443
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:39,599
Then you are really acting as collective
being

444
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:42,843
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

445
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:46,340
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

446
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:53,022
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

447
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:58,404
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

448
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:05,424
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

449
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,730
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

450
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:11,852
when you are one with the whole.

451
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:16,703
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

452
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:21,010
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

453
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,413
that this finger becomes numbed out.

454
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:29,394
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

455
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:34,829
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

456
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,857
In the same way if you are not collective

457
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:46,165
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

458
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:50,132
You are not going to be there to enjoy

459
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:55,993
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

460
00:36:56,194 --> 00:37:00,027
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

461
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:03,946
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

462
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:07,437
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

463
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:10,739
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

464
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,006
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

465
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:21,401
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

466
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:26,098
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

467
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:31,332
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

468
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,164
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

469
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:38,849
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

470
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,687
Just this decision, this faith, within you

471
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:46,459
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

472
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,563
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

473
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:56,423
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

474
00:37:56,624 --> 00:38:00,166
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

475
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:04,242
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

476
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:10,351
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

477
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:14,768
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

478
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:19,741
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

479
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:26,666
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

480
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:37,845
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

481
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:40,863
Where are we? Where do we stand?

482
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:44,424
What are we up to? What are we doing?

483
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:48,365
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

484
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:51,455
Why all these blessings are given to us?

485
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:55,399
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

486
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,441
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

487
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:03,748
or membership or anything like that.

488
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:09,394
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

489
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:16,782
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

490
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:20,844
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

491
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:24,299
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

492
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,018
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

493
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:32,340
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

494
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:37,249
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday. Now
imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age

495
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:45,602
and at this age most of the ladies, you
see, just, I don’t know what they do.

496
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:55,428
So now you must come up and work out
everything

497
00:39:55,629 --> 00:40:01,354
as far as possible, thinking that we all
have to stand up.

498
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:05,803
Now the children are coming up. They are
also going to stand up.

499
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,275
You are all looking younger to me and
younger to me.

500
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:11,776
Every day I see you, you look younger.
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you,

501
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:17,874
the way you look younger and I think,
is he the son or is he the father?

502
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,346
The situation is such that you are all
blessed:

503
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:31,815
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.
And everybody tells me,

504
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:34,381
“Mother, this is what has happened,
that has happened!” everything.

505
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:39,513
Now, so what? These are temptations,
be careful.

506
00:40:39,714 --> 00:40:41,803
This is not what you wanted.

507
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:48,859
What you wanted is the state of that
complete faith within yourself

508
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:54,175
where you don’t have to ask, nothing —
everything will work out.

509
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:59,716
Everything will work out. It works!
That’s the point is.

510
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,880
So, I hope next time when we meet

511
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:08,544
I’ll see even younger people than what
I see today

512
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:11,582
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

513
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,792
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

514
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:22,775
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

515
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:26,988
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

516
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,116
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

517
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:35,145
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

518
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:40,134
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

519
00:41:40,335 --> 00:41:42,962
And today is the day of certain promises.

520
00:41:43,163 --> 00:41:44,670
May God bless you for that.

521
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:50,081
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
