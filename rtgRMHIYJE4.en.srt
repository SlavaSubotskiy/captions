1
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:36,649
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

2
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:43,449
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

3
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:51,899
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

4
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,899
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

5
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,809
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

6
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:11,650
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

7
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,855
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

8
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:20,915
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

9
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:24,915
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

10
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:34,994
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

11
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:39,445
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

12
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:45,365
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

13
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:52,654
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

14
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:55,665
He would never like you to be unhappy.

15
00:02:55,665 --> 00:03:00,354
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

16
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:08,735
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

17
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:12,975
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

18
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:18,294
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

19
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:25,014
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

20
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:28,625
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

21
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,445
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

22
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:40,455
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

23
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:43,945
could do it.

24
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:47,095
But now you all have ascended.

25
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:52,395
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

26
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:55,915
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

27
00:03:55,915 --> 00:04:05,845
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

28
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,225
He has resurrected you, too.

29
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:12,385
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

30
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:18,285
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

31
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,315
through your Kundalini.

32
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:25,226
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

33
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:32,445
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

34
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:35,445
demands of His life.

35
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:42,275
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

36
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:49,495
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

37
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:55,905
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

38
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:58,095
like that.

39
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:04,225
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

40
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:10,675
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

41
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:24,455
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

42
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:27,245
itself, which He established.

43
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:36,695
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

44
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,775
as the Sahaj Yogis.

45
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,894
And this is going to be very easy.

46
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:50,484
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

47
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:54,245
has beautifully settled within you.

48
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:59,755
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

49
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:13,584
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

50
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:14,584
to do something.

51
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:20,245
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

52
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:22,685
we are talking.

53
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:31,585
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

54
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:35,795
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

55
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,545
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

56
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:45,705
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

57
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,105
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

58
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,665
It is a state.

59
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:55,175
It’s a state of your personality.

60
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,364
And there where I always say…

61
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:58,025
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

62
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:03,055
The sun is showing its results.

63
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,725
See how the sun listens to me!

64
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,535
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

65
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:12,995
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

66
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:27,644
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

67
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:36,984
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

68
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:42,585
and clapping).

69
00:07:42,585 --> 00:08:02,365
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

70
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,875
for this puja.

71
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:11,905
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

72
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:15,585
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

73
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:19,325
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

74
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,165
We have to have the moon there.

75
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,665
It’s important."

76
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:26,885
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

77
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:31,765
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

78
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,905
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

79
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:43,225
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

80
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:51,535
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

81
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:57,925
(laughter and clapping).

82
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:10,405
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

83
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:13,205
even worse, every time.

84
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:20,455
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

85
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:27,855
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

86
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:31,975
may spoil your tent.

87
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:41,355
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

88
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,765
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

89
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:49,285
And they did it.

90
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,255
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

91
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:56,695
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

92
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:57,995
So beautiful it was.

93
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:02,625
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

94
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:08,605
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

95
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:15,695
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

96
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,365
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

97
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:25,405
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

98
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,235
have proper temperature.

99
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,895
So look at the sky!

100
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,955
Look at everything!

101
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:34,295
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

102
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,575
It’s beautiful!

103
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:40,005
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

104
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:47,265
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

105
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:57,825
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

106
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:06,705
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

107
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:11,935
Christ resides in the Sun.

108
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:19,675
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

109
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:23,215
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

110
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,725
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

111
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:38,875
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

112
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,565
He had no defects in Him.

113
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:45,555
He was a perfect personality.

114
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:51,505
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

115
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:56,085
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

116
00:11:56,085 --> 00:12:05,795
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

117
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,565
it.

118
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:16,155
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

119
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,155
you.

120
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:25,795
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

121
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,395
He had no problems.

122
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:40,655
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

123
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:43,375
complete compassion.

124
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:52,155
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

125
00:12:52,155 --> 00:13:01,485
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

126
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,515
they are doing."

127
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:07,085
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

128
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:13,235
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

129
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,335
the thing one had to do.

130
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:20,295
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

131
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:27,305
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

132
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:31,555
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

133
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:34,585
He is the pattern we have to follow.

134
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:39,355
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

135
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:40,845
cross on our shoulder.

136
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:45,075
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

137
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,385
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

138
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:50,635
Anybody can carry the cross!

139
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:58,395
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

140
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:00,475
What is so great about it?

141
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:04,395
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

142
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:07,195
It’s nothing great.

143
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:10,425
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

144
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,755
That’s not the point!

145
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:18,385
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

146
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:20,635
That is what we have to realise.

147
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:28,745
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

148
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,045
that He has come for this great job here.

149
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:38,315
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

150
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:39,315
carpenter.

151
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:47,025
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

152
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:52,255
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

153
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:58,525
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

154
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:02,835
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

155
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:07,265
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

156
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:11,415
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

157
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:14,485
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

158
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:19,545
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

159
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,985
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

160
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,255
That’s not the way!

161
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,945
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

162
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:36,635
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

163
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:44,015
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

164
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:47,605
All of you have to meditate everyday.

165
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:52,545
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

166
00:15:52,545 --> 00:16:00,095
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

167
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,375
Our lives are for meditation.

168
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:07,415
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

169
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,295
Everyday you must meditate.

170
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:13,205
If you meditate your children will meditate.

171
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:19,715
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

172
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,994
can see work it out.

173
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:28,734
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

174
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:33,455
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

175
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:41,865
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

176
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:46,295
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

177
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:52,215
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

178
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:58,845
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

179
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:05,545
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

180
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:07,685
and you also know how to do it.

181
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:12,295
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

182
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:19,515
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

183
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:24,875
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

184
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,525
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

185
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:34,145
It has no truth in it.

186
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:38,105
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

187
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:46,065
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

188
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:52,625
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

189
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,115
interested in money.

190
00:17:55,115 --> 00:18:01,295
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

191
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:06,475
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

192
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:11,375
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

193
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,755
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

194
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:19,265
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

195
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,135
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

196
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:34,565
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

197
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:35,885
India you will be shocked.

198
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:40,745
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

199
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,645
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

200
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:46,645
means that.

201
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:47,645
Everything!

202
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:52,735
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

203
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:55,965
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

204
00:18:55,965 --> 00:19:02,185
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

205
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:06,615
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

206
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:12,495
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

207
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:18,625
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

208
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,915
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

209
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:28,195
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

210
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:32,845
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

211
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:37,225
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

212
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,835
It’s coming to that end.

213
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:47,085
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

214
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,685
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

215
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:55,355
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

216
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:58,085
I think I have told it to some people before.

217
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:03,815
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

218
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:07,725
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

219
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,365
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

220
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:16,805
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

221
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:17,875
which is supposed to be the highest.

222
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,175
I don’t know how they call it.

223
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:26,725
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

224
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,245
you meat because our fasting is there.

225
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,125
But we’ll have lunch."

226
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,095
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

227
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:37,985
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

228
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:38,985
according to them!

229
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:41,805
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

230
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,895
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

231
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:49,065
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

232
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:52,445
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

233
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:58,765
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

234
00:20:58,765 --> 00:20:59,765
us.

235
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:03,075
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

236
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,755
and they were laughing and laughing.

237
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,305
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

238
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:09,555
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

239
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:12,675
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

240
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:16,225
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

241
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,725
I said, “It’s not."

242
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:28,595
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

243
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,265
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

244
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:36,165
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

245
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:37,905
a religion, we have no religion.

246
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:39,995
Must have some religion."

247
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:47,775
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

248
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:52,825
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

249
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,065
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

250
00:21:56,065 --> 00:22:02,215
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

251
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,315
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

252
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:07,365
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

253
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:10,275
So we can’t have that religion!”

254
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,935
So they cancelled it.

255
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:17,365
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

256
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:24,495
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

257
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:30,635
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

258
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:34,125
They said, “That’s impossible!

259
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,395
How can we follow Islam?

260
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:37,765
That’s not possible!”

261
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,155
So, cancel it!

262
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:43,985
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

263
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:44,985
came.

264
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:47,635
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

265
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:54,315
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

266
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,325
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

267
00:22:56,325 --> 00:23:00,435
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

268
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:05,155
And that’s how they had this religion there.

269
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:07,775
So this is the situation of the religion today.

270
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:17,555
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

271
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:25,015
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

272
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:30,655
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

273
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:38,185
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

274
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:41,965
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

275
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:47,195
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

276
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:48,395
become an English man.

277
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:49,475
So you better give me a big name."

278
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,555
They said, “What name you want?”

279
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,845
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

280
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,575
So they called him Alexander.

281
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:57,935
But his name was Blondie, you see.

282
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:03,975
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

283
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:04,975
So Mr.

284
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:10,385
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

285
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:14,215
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

286
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:15,345
He said, “Why?

287
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:17,225
Why can’t I do that?”

288
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:20,535
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

289
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:21,535
will drop out, you see!”

290
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:23,615
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

291
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:26,875
He said, “This you can’t do!”

292
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:33,035
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

293
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:35,995
mean I have given up my religion!”

294
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:36,995
You see!

295
00:24:36,995 --> 00:24:44,715
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

296
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,885
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

297
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:54,375
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

298
00:24:54,375 --> 00:25:00,155
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

299
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,755
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

300
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:12,265
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

301
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:15,635
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

302
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:18,625
So you tell me and then go.

303
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:24,365
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

304
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:25,585
on their Agnyas.

305
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:32,145
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

306
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,545
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

307
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:37,775
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

308
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,675
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

309
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,675
I said, “What happened?

310
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:42,705
Where did you go?”

311
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,765
“Oh, we went to this temple."

312
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:45,765
I said, “Why?

313
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:46,885
You never told me.

314
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:48,189
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

315
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:52,025
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

316
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,945
Then it took them one month to clear out!

317
00:25:54,945 --> 00:26:00,685
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

318
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:07,565
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

319
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:14,565
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

320
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:16,254
So they must have special dresses!

321
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:21,335
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

322
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:24,535
I forgot the name, some big name.

323
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:31,135
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

324
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:36,845
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

325
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,755
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

326
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:45,375
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

327
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,655
all caught up.

328
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:54,445
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

329
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,585
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

330
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,705
You don’t belong to any church.

331
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,805
You don’t belong to any temple.

332
00:27:01,805 --> 00:27:06,565
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

333
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:15,585
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

334
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:17,805
He didn’t follow any religion.

335
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:21,035
He followed His own spiritual religion.

336
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:27,065
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

337
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:30,685
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

338
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:36,585
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

339
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:42,345
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

340
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:52,645
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

341
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:57,385
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

342
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,385
to Him.

343
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,725
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

344
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:02,575
It’s clearly [shown].

345
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:06,295
You can see it so clearly!

346
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:10,807
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

347
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:16,385
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

348
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:20,115
We are no more belonging to any religion.

349
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:26,345
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

350
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:33,295
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

351
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:37,685
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

352
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:44,735
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

353
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:50,545
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

354
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:55,855
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

355
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:59,735
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

356
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:06,535
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

357
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,045
It’s very surprising.

358
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:15,775
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

359
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:20,465
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

360
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:26,885
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

361
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:27,916
will do it!

362
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:33,055
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

363
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:41,105
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

364
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:48,655
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

365
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:52,925
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

366
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,085
It will not.

367
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,845
It will not punish you up to a point.

368
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:05,985
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

369
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:12,925
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

370
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:16,495
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

371
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:19,765
We are Sahaj Yogis."

372
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:24,345
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

373
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:27,355
Yet you have not reached that stage.

374
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:32,155
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

375
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:34,925
of the church and run away.

376
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:38,345
They’ll start shaking before you.

377
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:39,945
They will not know what has happened.

378
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:46,065
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

379
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:49,715
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

380
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:55,905
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

381
00:30:55,905 --> 00:31:00,135
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

382
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:06,165
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

383
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,965
these are the bhoots sitting here.

384
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:13,565
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

385
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:18,185
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

386
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,994
very, very dangerous.

387
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:27,715
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

388
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,055
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

389
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:33,504
one right-sided.

390
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:39,465
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

391
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:42,065
It’s the individual that is important.

392
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:47,105
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

393
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:51,105
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

394
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:55,015
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

395
00:31:55,015 --> 00:32:02,555
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

396
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:08,515
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

397
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:17,185
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

398
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:22,995
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

399
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:26,795
collective is lost, completely lost.

400
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:35,475
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

401
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:40,605
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

402
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:41,925
the time.

403
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:42,925
Now why?

404
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:46,905
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

405
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:52,265
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

406
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:55,685
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

407
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,555
The individuals have to be strong.

408
00:32:57,555 --> 00:33:04,295
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

409
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:07,535
more than people who can drink here.

410
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:12,994
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

411
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:15,265
more than even sardarjees.

412
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:21,395
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

413
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:24,715
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

414
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:33,604
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

415
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:40,025
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

416
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:44,885
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

417
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:47,225
He’s still there.

418
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,175
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

419
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,755
So that fails.

420
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:54,505
So the individuals are weak in that case.

421
00:33:54,505 --> 00:34:01,515
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

422
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:04,064
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

423
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:09,735
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

424
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:16,645
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

425
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:17,735
to bear them.

426
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:21,295
An individual cannot bear money.

427
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:24,505
He cannot bear power of any kind.

428
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:27,425
He cannot bear love.

429
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:30,745
He cannot bear kindness.

430
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:37,155
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

431
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:44,415
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

432
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:54,565
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

433
00:34:54,565 --> 00:35:00,715
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

434
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,625
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

435
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:08,905
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

436
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:19,445
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

437
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:27,395
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

438
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:29,035
collective.

439
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:35,125
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

440
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:40,715
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

441
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:45,064
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

442
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:52,715
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

443
00:35:52,715 --> 00:36:01,445
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

444
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:05,275
quality to enjoy the joy.

445
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:11,715
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

446
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:18,535
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

447
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:23,545
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

448
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:32,585
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

449
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,655
acting, it’s insensitive.

450
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:42,195
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

451
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:45,965
going to be dropped out.

452
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:54,275
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

453
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:55,835
collective.

454
00:36:55,835 --> 00:37:01,775
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

455
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,195
have to be collective.

456
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:07,435
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

457
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,895
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

458
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:15,195
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

459
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:17,925
Better find faults with yourself.

460
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:20,635
The rest I’ll look after.

461
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:27,535
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

462
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:30,415
enjoy the company of others.

463
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:38,745
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

464
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:45,715
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

465
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:50,625
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

466
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:55,615
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

467
00:37:55,615 --> 00:38:03,575
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

468
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:10,165
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

469
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:14,495
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

470
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:24,105
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

471
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:37,245
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

472
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,645
Where are we?

473
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:40,505
Where do we stand?

474
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,165
What are we up to?

475
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:44,265
What are we doing?

476
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:46,275
What is our responsibility?

477
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,185
What is expected of us?

478
00:38:48,185 --> 00:38:51,025
Why all these blessings are given to us?

479
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:55,435
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

480
00:38:55,435 --> 00:39:03,825
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

481
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,545
I think it’s my commitment.

482
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:15,045
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

483
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:16,045
should be pure.

484
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:20,645
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

485
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:24,185
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

486
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:27,935
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

487
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:32,015
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

488
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:34,064
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

489
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:41,785
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

490
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:47,675
just, I don’t know what they do.

491
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:48,675
(laughter)

492
00:39:48,675 --> 00:40:00,225
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

493
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:01,225
to stand up.

494
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:03,005
Now the children are coming up.

495
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,065
They are also going to stand up.

496
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:07,935
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

497
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:09,945
Every day I see you, you look younger.

498
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:13,895
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

499
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:22,035
son or is he the father?

500
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:30,615
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

501
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:34,025
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

502
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:35,425
Now, so what?

503
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:39,275
These are temptations, be careful.

504
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:41,044
This is not what you wanted.

505
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:49,655
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

506
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:55,865
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

507
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:56,865
It works!

508
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:58,985
That’s [what] the point is.

509
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:08,425
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

510
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,555
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

511
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,995
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

512
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:17,535
He was very young, I must say.

513
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:22,855
But how much He has done for humanity.

514
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,725
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

515
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:27,865
It’s remarkable!

516
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,575
It’s really remarkable!

517
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:34,785
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

518
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:39,905
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

519
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:42,695
And today is the day of certain promises.

520
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:44,065
May God bless you for that.

521
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:47,325
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
