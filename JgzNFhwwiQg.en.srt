1
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,855
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

2
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:14,732
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

3
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:21,219
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

4
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:31,505
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

5
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:35,667
As I have said, you all are gurus

6
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:42,742
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

7
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:47,206
but the main thing one should understand

8
00:08:52,271 --> 00:09:02,890
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

9
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,794
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

10
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:11,105
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

11
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:22,148
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

12
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:28,561
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

13
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:33,791
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

14
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:42,790
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

15
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:49,975
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

16
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,679
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

17
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,799
we cannot assimilate it that well.

18
00:09:56,982 --> 00:10:05,038
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

19
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:12,390
We have to realise that we have all come

20
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:19,733
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

21
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:24,151
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

22
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:30,610
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

23
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:39,974
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

24
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:52,865
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

25
00:10:53,597 --> 00:11:03,366
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

26
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:07,599
We want to grab things of others;

27
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,347
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

28
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,324
They first used to grab lands,

29
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:28,976
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

30
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,975
Then they were not satisfied with that,

31
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:42,095
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

32
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:48,390
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

33
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,435
still they would grab.

34
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:59,014
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

35
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:03,965
but it is there because of our inheritance.

36
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:10,979
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

37
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,102
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

38
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:20,823
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

39
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:29,253
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

40
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:37,519
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

41
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:45,590
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

42
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:51,202
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

43
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,866
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

44
00:12:56,067 --> 00:13:03,135
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

45
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:07,306
we lack in some talents than another
person,

46
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:12,414
and they try to overpower that person

47
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:17,311
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

48
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,825
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

49
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:32,696
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

50
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:39,395
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

51
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:46,972
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

52
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:52,400
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

53
00:13:52,601 --> 00:14:02,021
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

54
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:07,722
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

55
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:12,813
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

56
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:20,689
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

57
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:32,299
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

58
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:36,298
very violent temper.

59
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:43,574
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

60
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:47,616
When you see something which you don’t
like,

61
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:51,362
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

62
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:55,014
immediately you flare up.

63
00:14:55,215 --> 00:15:03,252
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

64
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:08,814
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

65
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:13,528
they were using match into it, matchstick.

66
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:18,065
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

67
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:23,792
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

68
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:28,957
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

69
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:33,025
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

70
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:38,879
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

71
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,083
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

72
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:52,482
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

73
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:59,036
we should not try to oppress others.

74
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:03,326
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

75
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:11,255
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

76
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:19,938
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

77
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:29,553
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

78
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:36,505
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

79
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:42,140
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

80
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:45,347
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

81
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:49,581
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

82
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:54,602
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

83
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:57,521
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

84
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:02,698
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

85
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:07,422
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

86
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:11,549
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

87
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,430
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

88
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,175
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

89
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:23,076
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

90
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:27,501
not yet fully equipped to understand,

91
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:38,456
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

92
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:46,930
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

93
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:56,977
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

94
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,937
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

95
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:10,374
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

96
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:14,877
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

97
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:20,885
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

98
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:27,502
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

99
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:33,309
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

100
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:36,448
We may be even snakes animals.

101
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:42,331
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

102
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:46,244
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

103
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:50,217
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

104
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:52,641
if there’s a snake within us.

105
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:59,743
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

106
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:04,429
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

107
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:13,488
Now, this is not a very good situation,

108
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:18,047
that we are still at the level of animals

109
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:21,831
and our inheritance is still working in us.

110
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:25,833
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

111
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,812
And for good guru, you have to have

112
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:37,997
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

113
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:40,862
After all,

114
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:58,019
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

115
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,884
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

116
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:14,083
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

117
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:19,977
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

118
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,791
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

119
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,908
I tell you, it will improve.

120
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,869
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

121
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:38,553
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

122
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:42,716
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

123
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,378
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

124
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,978
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

125
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,972
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

126
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:59,231
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

127
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:03,541
 so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

128
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:08,100
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

129
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:11,755
I must say other gurus were not like that.

130
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:19,787
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

131
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:24,212
and they used to lose temper on people.

132
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:31,634
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

133
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,731
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

134
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:42,780
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

135
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:47,935
And one of them got lost in the money.”

136
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,172
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

137
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:55,126
“And second one got lost in the women.”

138
00:21:55,327 --> 00:22:01,378
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

139
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:05,051
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

140
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:09,457
and kindness, better get around them.”

141
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:15,729
So, the one who was lost…

142
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,465
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

143
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,639
So who are those sitting outside?

144
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:37,603
Open it fully. Of course!

145
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,821
Good.

146
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:28,090
Let them move this side.

147
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,517
Now is better.]

148
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:53,324
So as a guru, you must conclude

149
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:58,006
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

150
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:06,132
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

151
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:11,429
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

152
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:15,337
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

153
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:22,564
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

154
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:29,386
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

155
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,976
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

156
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:39,378
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

157
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:42,302
to achieve this state ...
(interruption)

158
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:48,199
(Or, if they have) got Realisation, then,

159
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,438
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

160
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:59,868
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

161
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:03,178
and how others have to achieve it.

162
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:16,065
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

163
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:26,757
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

164
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:31,692
give his family up, do this, do that.

165
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:35,120
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

166
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,927
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

167
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:47,763
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

168
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:55,002
And the worse comes to worse,

169
00:25:55,203 --> 00:26:01,914
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

170
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:06,359
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

171
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:09,378
what the another person has to say,

172
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:15,679
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

173
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:23,739
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

174
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,808
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

175
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:37,964
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

176
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:44,221
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

177
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,227
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

178
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:54,342
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

179
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:59,269
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

180
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,352
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

181
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:07,007
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

182
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:12,892
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

183
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:18,080
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

184
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:22,739
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

185
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:30,722
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

186
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:35,115
So not to hurt people is very important.

187
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:40,669
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

188
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:50,398
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

189
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,533
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

190
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:59,960
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

191
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:08,455
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

192
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:13,422
As you are, you got your Realisation.

193
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,666
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

194
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:21,164
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

195
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:25,058
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

196
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:32,733
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

197
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:35,127
You don’t have to pay for it.

198
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:39,073
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

199
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:44,620
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

200
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:50,198
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

201
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,490
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

202
00:28:55,691 --> 00:29:00,850
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

203
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:04,527
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

204
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,152
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

205
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,916
Why? Why do we do it?

206
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:17,152
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

207
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:22,451
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

208
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:27,291
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

209
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:35,861
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

210
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:39,197
Now you have become a greater human being

211
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,053
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

212
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:46,932
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

213
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:55,291
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

214
00:29:56,683 --> 00:30:01,838
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

215
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:09,537
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

216
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:17,669
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

217
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:23,158
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

218
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,643
But that too in a such a soft manner

219
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:35,183
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

220
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:46,501
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

221
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:52,811
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

222
00:30:53,012 --> 00:31:00,265
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

223
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:03,488
alright, doesn’t matter.

224
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:07,392
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

225
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:14,821
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

226
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:21,842
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

227
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:26,295
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

228
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:32,759
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

229
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:37,778
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

230
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:42,771
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

231
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:49,257
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

232
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:53,015
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

233
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:56,159
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

234
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,902
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

235
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:07,433
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

236
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:12,083
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

237
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:17,510
or some big position, then what does he do?

238
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:22,440
You can’t challenge him any way.

239
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,689
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

240
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,680
because he is so identified with that.

241
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,788
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

242
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:49,424
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

243
00:32:49,625 --> 00:33:00,653
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

244
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:10,820
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

245
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:16,509
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

246
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,955
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

247
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:29,601
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

248
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:36,379
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

249
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:43,414
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

250
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:52,127
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

251
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,751
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

252
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:02,219
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

253
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,444
it will never work out. So you must
understand

254
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:15,373
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

255
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:21,093
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

256
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:24,855
Not by argument, not by saying things,

257
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:34,085
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

258
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:40,401
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

259
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:45,457
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

260
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:49,637
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

261
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,412
and thirdly that he values love.

262
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:59,734
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

263
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:09,132
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

264
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:14,362
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

265
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:21,935
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

266
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:27,444
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

267
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:32,145
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

268
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:39,107
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

269
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:42,966
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:49,017
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

271
00:35:49,217 --> 00:35:59,657
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

272
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:13,204
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

273
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:17,732
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

274
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:22,367
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

275
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:25,606
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

276
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,963
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

277
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:34,490
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

278
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:38,598
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

279
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:43,820
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

280
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:48,114
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

281
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:56,974
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

282
00:36:57,175 --> 00:37:01,889
You put attention, but not attachment.

283
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:05,819
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

284
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,521
What solves the problem is attention.

285
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:17,351
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

286
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:23,727
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

287
00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:27,625
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

288
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:34,103
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

289
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:41,833
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

290
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:45,919
paying attention to that person.

291
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,528
And then your attention will work.

292
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:53,163
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

293
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:58,808
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

294
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:02,918
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

295
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,931
because you are attached to that person,

296
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:11,413
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

297
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:19,869
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

298
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,706
then your attention doesn’t work out.

299
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:28,298
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

300
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,664
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

301
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:34,624
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

302
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:38,665
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

303
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:45,633
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

304
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:51,074
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

305
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,254
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

306
00:38:54,454 --> 00:38:56,531
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

307
00:38:56,731 --> 00:39:02,930
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

308
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:08,589
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

309
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:15,019
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

310
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:22,556
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

311
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:26,565
Attention should be absolutely free,

312
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:33,456
so it works automatically, automatically.

313
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:38,309
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

314
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,417
the attention will work it (out).

315
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:47,062
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

316
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:51,604
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

317
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:56,232
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

318
00:39:56,524 --> 00:40:00,973
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

319
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:06,379
but something higher, where your attention
works,

320
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,852
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

321
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:15,334
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

322
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:19,168
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

323
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:25,187
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

324
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:32,952
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

325
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:49,235
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

326
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:52,783
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

327
00:40:52,999 --> 00:41:01,614
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

328
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:05,380
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

329
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:09,134
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

330
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:13,367
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

331
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:19,846
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

332
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:25,619
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

333
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,891
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

334
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:37,272
You have to notice: What are they doing?

335
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:44,981
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

336
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:50,695
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

337
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:57,309
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

338
00:41:57,486 --> 00:42:02,475
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

339
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,000
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

340
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:15,503
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

341
00:42:15,704 --> 00:42:20,752
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

342
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:23,971
It’s just an explanation.

343
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:28,999
But if you really don’t fix your attention

344
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,474
to one person or ten persons only,

345
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:38,628
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

346
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:49,239
It receives all the information and also
it gives

347
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:56,642
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

348
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:01,697
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

349
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:06,706
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

350
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:14,181
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

351
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:19,503
and in that you are not involved.

352
00:43:19,704 --> 00:43:23,942
You see the situation and you are away
from it.

353
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:28,372
Then you can solve that problem better.

354
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:36,069
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

355
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:43,065
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

356
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:48,120
cannot solve the problem.

357
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:55,911
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

358
00:43:56,112 --> 00:44:06,189
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

359
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:17,604
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

360
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:23,023
So our attention has to be always free

361
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:28,671
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

362
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:34,572
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

363
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:40,308
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

364
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:47,826
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

365
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:53,286
Through introspection you will understand

366
00:44:53,487 --> 00:45:00,074
that you need help to solve your problems.

367
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:06,177
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

368
00:45:06,378 --> 00:45:13,784
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

369
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:25,097
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

370
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:37,445
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

371
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:41,547
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

372
00:45:41,748 --> 00:45:46,935
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

373
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:52,902
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

374
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:56,627
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

375
00:45:56,828 --> 00:46:01,125
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

376
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:05,701
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

377
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:10,509
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

378
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,020
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

379
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:20,508
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

380
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:27,812
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

381
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:35,567
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

382
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:38,367
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

383
00:46:38,568 --> 00:46:42,525
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

384
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:47,211
today we have a very complex society.

385
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:51,188
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

386
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:56,548
in which only thinking is responsible.

387
00:46:56,749 --> 00:46:59,673
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

388
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:04,441
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

389
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:09,950
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

390
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:17,128
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

391
00:47:23,111 --> 00:47:29,687
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

392
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:34,127
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

393
00:47:34,328 --> 00:47:41,028
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

394
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:46,131
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

395
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:52,943
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

396
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:57,303
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

397
00:47:57,504 --> 00:48:01,901
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

398
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:06,753
So there was only one building ahead,

399
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:14,551
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

400
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:18,325
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

401
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:24,482
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

402
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:29,492
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

403
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:32,209
I was amazed how it is there.

404
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,878
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

405
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,918
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

406
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,231
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

407
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:48,507
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

408
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:55,637
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

409
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:02,383
How, you see, things can be improved,

410
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:15,252
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

411
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:21,271
But love is truth and truth is love.

412
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:27,456
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

413
00:49:27,657 --> 00:49:35,124
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

414
00:49:35,324 --> 00:49:39,214
because it will be truthful.

415
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:44,781
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

416
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:49,141
because it is absolutely truthful.

417
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:52,502
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

418
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,999
you should be extremely truthful.

419
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,826
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

420
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:05,886
but you must use such ways and methods

421
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:11,004
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

422
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:15,284
which will have an effect on that person.

423
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:20,859
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

424
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,261
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

425
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:31,608
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

426
00:50:31,817 --> 00:50:36,315
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

427
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:43,982
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

428
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,685
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

429
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:58,648
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

430
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:07,499
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

431
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,246
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

432
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:16,775
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

433
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:22,119
very easily, anything that you want to do.

434
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:29,135
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

435
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:35,442
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

436
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:40,068
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

437
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:43,816
very important position that they are
gurus.

438
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:49,841
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

439
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,734
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

440
00:51:53,935 --> 00:52:01,834
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

441
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,213
People should not doubt him,

442
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:08,747
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

443
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:16,078
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

444
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:22,161
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

445
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:29,157
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

446
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,622
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

447
00:52:32,823 --> 00:52:37,341
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

448
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:40,185
I tell you – very lots of people.

449
00:52:40,386 --> 00:52:43,747
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

450
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:47,142
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

451
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:53,238
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

452
00:52:53,439 --> 00:53:06,301
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

453
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:13,381
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

454
00:53:13,643 --> 00:53:16,940
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

455
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,961
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

456
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:23,536
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

457
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:29,661
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

458
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:34,432
They all warned Me. So I came here

459
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:37,093
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

460
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:40,390
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

461
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:46,162
He was surprised, how can I do that.

462
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:52,738
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

463
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:58,902
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

464
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:05,473
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

465
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:10,070
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

466
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:16,151
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

467
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:24,329
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

468
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:32,519
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

469
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:38,537
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

470
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:43,672
your particular ideas about particular
things,

471
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:49,893
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

472
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:55,323
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

473
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:58,919
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

474
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:05,728
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

475
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:11,828
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

476
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:18,260
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

477
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:22,903
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

478
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:30,619
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

479
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:37,017
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

480
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:41,190
It emits and creates a path for you,

481
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:45,952
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

482
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:50,460
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

483
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:55,439
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

484
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,068
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

485
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:07,665
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

486
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:11,081
May God bless you all.

487
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:30,191
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

488
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:34,265
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

489
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:36,855
which is also a human quality.

490
00:56:37,055 --> 00:56:42,059
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

491
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,472
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

492
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:52,181
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

493
00:56:52,382 --> 00:56:55,733
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

494
00:56:55,934 --> 00:57:02,748
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

495
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:06,678
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

496
00:57:06,879 --> 00:57:09,236
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

497
00:57:09,437 --> 00:57:13,195
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

498
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:18,026
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

499
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:22,279
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

500
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,100
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

501
00:57:27,301 --> 00:57:31,124
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

502
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:35,265
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

503
00:57:35,466 --> 00:57:41,778
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

504
00:57:41,978 --> 00:57:46,897
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

505
00:57:47,098 --> 00:57:49,360
and she has done something very wrong,

506
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:52,540
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

507
00:57:52,741 --> 00:57:55,261
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

508
00:57:55,462 --> 00:58:06,465
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

509
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:14,329
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

510
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:19,425
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

511
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:23,834
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

512
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:28,248
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

513
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:34,008
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

514
00:58:34,209 --> 00:58:38,099
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

515
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:45,627
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

516
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:49,202
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

517
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:53,969
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

518
00:58:54,170 --> 00:59:00,218
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

519
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:06,673
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

520
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:09,919
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

521
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,285
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

522
00:59:14,486 --> 00:59:17,414
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

523
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:20,592
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

524
00:59:20,793 --> 00:59:25,360
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

525
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:32,029
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

526
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,731
So thank you very much again and again.

527
00:59:36,932 --> 00:59:39,775
May God bless you.

528
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,215
May God bless you all.

529
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:06,076
Alright.

530
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:15,898
Yes.

531
01:00:16,691 --> 01:00:21,274
Please, can you remove it? Can you
remove it?
