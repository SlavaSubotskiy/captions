1
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:07,484
Since we have come to Cabella, it is the ten
years completed.

2
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:21,223
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,
we have been able to progress in Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:29,903
Now, today we are going to have a Guru Puja.

4
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:39,934
As I have said, you all are gurus and you
want to worship Me as your Guru.

5
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:42,993
It is all right.

6
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:59,528
But the main thing one should understand,
that you have become guru, no doubt, because

7
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:05,672
you have the knowledge, you have the absolute
knowledge.

8
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:10,907
And so we can say you have become gurus, no
doubt.

9
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:23,931
But one has to understand that you have reached
a state where you can raise the Kundalini,

10
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:27,641
you can give Realization to others.

11
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:34,081
Also you know what is the absolute knowledge.

12
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:49,530
To know the absolute knowledge is very important,
and to assimilate is even much more important.

13
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,651
Though we know the absolute knowledge, we
cannot assimilate it that well.

14
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,761
That means we cannot go deep into it.

15
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:03,851
What is the reason for that?

16
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:18,560
We have to realize that we have all come out
of the heritage that was the animal kingdom.

17
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,010
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

18
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:36,236
So there are so many things of the animal
heritage that linger in us: the aggressiveness,

19
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:52,415
the domination, peevishness, fear, grabbing.

20
00:10:53,189 --> 00:11:03,053
All these are our inheritance, and they are
within us lingering.

21
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:10,471
We want to grab things of others’ - not
you people, of course not, but people who

22
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,521
are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

23
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:29,561
They first used to grab lands, then they started
grabbing people, making them slaves.

24
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:38,921
Then they were not satisfied with that, so
they were grabbing kingdoms, jewelry and all

25
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:41,712
these things.

26
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:43,792
So just to grab.

27
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:51,042
They have no legal right, still they would
grab.

28
00:11:51,042 --> 00:12:03,952
It seems, it seems very funny, it seems very
inhuman, but it is there because of our inheritance.

29
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:10,612
Now there are so many other things, like jealousy.

30
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:18,702
Among animals there is very little of that,
they don't have jealousies so much as we have;

31
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:28,512
while we have inherited this jealousy by our
own reactions and thinking.

32
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:36,212
People get jealous and they want to put down
others.

33
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:45,232
If they cannot achieve any height, they want
to bring down the heights of others.

34
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:52,093
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings, they think whatever is done in the

35
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,432
name of jealousy is all right.

36
00:12:55,432 --> 00:13:02,712
They become very conscious that “We are
lower than another person.

37
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:12,572
We lack in some talents than another person,”
and they try to overpower that person, because

38
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:18,632
of the force of jealousy behind them.

39
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:29,422
Now the trouble is, though we are human beings,
we have inherited so many animal qualities,

40
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:37,672
like we are ferocious, we are angry and we
get upset, as animals do.

41
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:48,092
But additional to that, human beings can react
because of their thinking.

42
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,592
They think.

43
00:13:49,592 --> 00:14:00,172
They can think, and by thinking, all these
inherited properties become perverted.

44
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:05,662
Like a person wants to put down another person.

45
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:13,692
Then he doesn’t behave like an animal, in
a straightforward way, but he will find out

46
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:21,702
a device, a method, he’ll think it over
how to do it.

47
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:35,982
The main problem with human beings is that
they still have inherited very violent temper.

48
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:42,714
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

49
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:49,292
When you see something which you don't like,
which is against your will, it may be something

50
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,802
like that, immediately you flare up.

51
00:14:52,802 --> 00:15:02,801
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor, they
had put a sugar candy.

52
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:12,412
To sugar candy they were putting the matchbox,
you see, they were using a match into it,

53
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,412
matchstick.

54
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,782
It would not take the fire.

55
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,502
They tried and tried, it would not.

56
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,432
So I said, "Let Me see what is that."

57
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:23,452
So that was a sugar candy.

58
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:28,542
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

59
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,702
So the quality of the person is known in the
same way.

60
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:39,772
If with the slightest provocation, if he gets
into temper and gets annoyed, then his quality

61
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,942
is not very good as a guru.

62
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:56,782
As a guru we should not flare up, we should
not get angry, we should not try to oppress

63
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:57,782
others.

64
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,622
"But what can we do, then?"

65
00:16:00,622 --> 00:16:02,892
people will ask.

66
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:08,784
We have another method, what we call is love.

67
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,162
Love.

68
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:22,512
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person, so what happens

69
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:32,032
that it doesn’t give you any anger, and
the another person, you don't make him angry

70
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,032
also.

71
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:36,082
Anger begets anger.

72
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:44,032
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort because he is afraid of you,

73
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:50,282
it may be that; but in his heart he will keep
a revenge in his mind that “One day I will

74
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,282
show him.

75
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:53,502
Why should he get angry with me?”

76
00:16:53,486 --> 00:17:02,276
So in Sahaja Yoga, please remember that love
is the only way we can solve the problem.

77
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:10,162
Now if something goes wrong, say, in the ashram,
if you get angry with that person, what will

78
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,182
happen?

79
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:15,062
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

80
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:19,332
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he may realize
that it was a wrong thing to do.

81
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:28,852
But if he’s a bad Sahaja Yogi, not yet fully
equipped to understand, then what he will

82
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:29,852
do?

83
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:38,022
He will just feel that “This man has insulted
me.

84
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:47,932
He has deliberately put me down and all that,
and I should try to take a revenge.”

85
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:55,662
Among animals this activity is very limited.

86
00:17:55,662 --> 00:18:01,172
I don't think they believe in revenge, except
for a few animals.

87
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:11,912
They say that if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite, it will come back on you,

88
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:14,792
that's what is said.

89
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:19,932
And this one is something, one quality of
the snake.

90
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:28,482
But as we have passed through all these different
categories, we might be having some of the

91
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:36,092
qualities of some of these animals within
us, we may be even snakes anywhere.

92
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:43,822
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you, you’ll remember it all your life.

93
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:49,852
“He has hurt me, so I’ll put him right
one day, I’ll take a revenge!”

94
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,232
If there’s a snake within us.

95
00:18:52,232 --> 00:19:00,092
But now if there's a tiger within you, so
you’ll become very ferocious, at the smallest

96
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:05,172
thing you'll get angry, lose temper.

97
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:17,832
Now, this is not a very good situation, that
we are still at the level of animals and our

98
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:21,502
inheritance is still working in us.

99
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:23,572
So we have to keep a watch.

100
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:34,782
We have to be good gurus, and for a good guru,
you have to have a very peaceful, compassionate,

101
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:37,802
loving temperament.

102
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:59,222
After all, one has to understand that people
have this inheritance, and some people have

103
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:02,821
more, or some people have this, or some people
have that.

104
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:13,732
For that, if you get angry with that person,
it’s not going to help him or help you.

105
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:20,751
But if you are loving and compassionate and
you explain that person what is the problem

106
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:27,122
is and what you want to do, I tell you it
will improve, he’ll definitely improve and

107
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,442
he’ll feel your love.

108
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:38,202
Of course sometimes, sometimes it’s necessary
to also forgive such a person.

109
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:42,332
Such a person is to be forgiven, absolutely.

110
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:48,542
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs, all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

111
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,587
and he goes on still with the same, doesn't
mean that.

112
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:54,759
“Forgiven” means “forgotten.”

113
00:20:54,751 --> 00:21:01,441
Such and such person has been misbehaving,
so just forget, forget it, completely forget

114
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,969
it.

115
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:07,289
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja Yogi
guru.

116
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:16,850
I must say others gurus were not like that,
they were absolutely, I would say, extremely

117
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:23,343
hot-tempered, and they used to lose temper
on people.

118
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:30,874
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them.

119
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:34,725
And with this kindness You cannot create good
people.

120
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:38,508
I’ve had enough of it,” he said.

121
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:47,808
“I had made two people into gurus, and one
of them got lost in the money.”

122
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,428
“All right, what happened to the second?”

123
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:54,558
“And second one got lost in the women.”

124
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,878
So I said, ”Now it's all right.

125
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:05,708
If they are lost, they are lost, but if you
can revive them with your love, affection

126
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,808
and kindness, better get around them.”

127
00:22:09,808 --> 00:23:34,428
So the one who was lost… [interruption]

128
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:57,324
So as a guru, you must conclude that they
are still lingering with their inheritance.

129
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:04,993
But the second problem is much worse, because
human beings can think.

130
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:11,553
Of course animals also think, but it is always
conditioning.

131
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:15,905
Whatever conditioning they have, accordingly
they behave.

132
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:22,431
But they don't have ego, that kind as human
beings have developed.

133
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,809
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

134
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:36,858
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that “We have done so much,

135
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:44,659
we have worked so hard to achieve this state,
and why should we give Realizations to others?”

136
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:54,268
Or if they have got Realization, then, “What
have they done?

137
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,288
Why should they get Realization?”

138
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,287
It’s become a comparison between their own
state and how they have achieved it, and how

139
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:03,146
others have to achieve it.

140
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:15,464
So they make all kinds of different torturing,
troubling maneuvres.

141
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:29,438
For example, they may make the disciple stand
on his head, give his family up, do this,

142
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:30,718
do that.

143
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:34,158
They’ll beat them, they can beat also.

144
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:43,838
They will make him stay in the water for a
long time, make him stand under, on one feet.

145
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:58,608
Like this they punish, and the worst comes
to worst, they may beat with sticks or with

146
00:25:58,608 --> 00:25:59,608
stones.

147
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:01,818
They’re like that.

148
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:08,138
They don't want to talk, they don't want to
understand what the another person has to

149
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:17,308
say, or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

150
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:24,258
All this anger and all these things might
have been all right before, but after the

151
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:27,518
advent of Sahaja Yoga you must know it is
not necessary.

152
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:38,048
It is not at all necessary to give any physical
punishment to your disciples.

153
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:44,258
Now also the mental punishment to your disciple
should not be given.

154
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:51,788
Like people start saying all kinds of things
to their disciple; like saying they, I am

155
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:59,308
saying, say there is a leader, and the leader
finds something wrong with the disciple, then

156
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:03,878
he goes on saying, “Now you are like this,
your father was like this, your grandfather

157
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:09,008
was like this, your great- grandfather was
like this, and you are also like this.”

158
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:12,788
Or some sort of thing that will hurt him.

159
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:17,308
By hurting a person, you are not going to
help.

160
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:22,478
Supposing while walking you are hurt, you
can't walk.

161
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:30,728
In your spiritual ascent also if you are hurt,
you cannot go ahead.

162
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:33,028
So not to hurt people is very important.

163
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:42,498
Once you go on hurting others, then you are
not a good guru, you are not a one who is

164
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:48,918
really being kind and understanding of the
disciple.

165
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:57,308
In Sahaja Yoga it's a different thing altogether,
because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga

166
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:05,318
without doing any kind of penance, any kind
of a guilty consciousness, confessions, anything.

167
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,318
Nothing!

168
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:14,077
As you are, you got your Realization.

169
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:18,798
Nobody had to stand on their heads, give up
their husbands, wives, their families, this

170
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,228
thing - nothing of the kind.

171
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:27,717
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,
whatever conditions you are, you are given

172
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:32,638
Realization - it’s a fact.

173
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:39,378
You don't have to pay for it, you don't have
to exert yourself, don't have to do anything.

174
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:45,018
Just you get it, sitting down wherever you
are.

175
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:53,718
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you that you have a power of love,

176
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,568
of compassion.

177
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,758
Out of your love you have given Realization.

178
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,698
We never realize that.

179
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:05,868
Supposing we are anxious to give Realization
to people, we want to go to the villages,

180
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:08,618
work there and give them Realization.

181
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:09,618
Why?

182
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:11,898
Why do we do it?

183
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:19,428
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything, but just out of the love that

184
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:24,308
is within your heart that you feel, “Why
am I enjoying everything?

185
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:26,087
Why others are not enjoying?”

186
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:35,828
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realization.

187
00:29:35,828 --> 00:29:41,457
Now you have become a greater human being,
and you feel concern.

188
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:47,008
Others are getting ruined, they are going
on the wrong path, they are doing wrong things;

189
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:56,518
and that makes you feel very, very upset,
and you want to help them.

190
00:29:56,518 --> 00:30:03,658
And this understanding once you have, then
you will know how to deal with the person

191
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:10,388
with whom you have to behave like a guru.

192
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:16,228
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

193
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:24,098
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they have committed, but that too in a, such

194
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:36,158
a soft manner that a person doesn’t get
any shock out of that.

195
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:46,899
All this thing of attachments also: now somebody
has too much attachment, say, for the family,

196
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:52,858
for the wife, for the children or someone.

197
00:30:52,858 --> 00:31:00,138
And once they come to Sahaj Yoga, still they
have same amount of attachment.

198
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:03,508
All right, doesn’t matter.

199
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:11,128
But how far they will go with that attachment,
how long it will continue is the point.

200
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:14,788
You should be detached.

201
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:21,808
If I say, you cannot be; it's a state, it's
a state of mind when you are detached.

202
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:28,748
But when it comes to doing something for them,
you will go all out to help them.

203
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:32,337
But you are not a attached person.

204
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:38,028
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

205
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:45,778
Attached person is always worried about the
other person, goes on thinking about the other

206
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:52,228
person, cannot think of Sahaja Yoga, only
think of the people with whom he is attached.

207
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:58,695
Then he is very sensitive, you can't say anything
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise

208
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:00,843
he jumps.

209
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:07,288
Attachment is also with the name that he has.

210
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:15,728
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing, or some big position, then what

211
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:17,418
does he do?

212
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:26,848
You can't challenge him any way, you cannot
by any words you can challenge him, because

213
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:28,848
he’s so identified with that.

214
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:36,328
He thinks he’s a big person who has achieved
such a lot of positions in life.

215
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:49,326
He’s so much attached that he wants also
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

216
00:32:49,358 --> 00:33:02,278
Now which is the way you can solve that problem?

217
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:12,758
Supposing somebody is very much attached to
his wife, say for example, then you should

218
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:19,108
not discuss and argue with that person, not
at all, because he’s still coming up slowly,

219
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:22,978
slowly up to this stage.

220
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:29,648
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

221
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:31,378
So what do you have to do?

222
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:37,638
If he’s attached to his wife, let it be.

223
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:46,688
But the Divine will work it out, and he will
realize that what he has been thinking, doing

224
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:52,268
and taking decisions is all wrong.

225
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:57,717
And once he discovered it himself, then he
will get detached.

226
00:33:57,717 --> 00:34:04,178
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out, it will never work out.

227
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:13,238
So you must understand that as human beings,
whatever we were, also as Sahaja Yogis, we

228
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:14,488
have problems.

229
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:23,818
And these should be slowly, slowly should
be dissolved; not by argument, not by saying

230
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:27,778
things, but by love and compassion.

231
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:38,898
If you have love for a person, you will be
amazed, ninety-nine percent people value love.

232
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:45,528
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

233
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:53,728
First is his inheritance, second is, he thinks,
and thirdly that he values love.

234
00:34:53,728 --> 00:35:03,077
Anybody who loves, the another person values
that love, because he thinks that “This

235
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:11,998
particular person is loving me; not my wealth,
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he is

236
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,408
loving me.”

237
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:25,638
And this idea of love, this is something that
will get him completely detached from that

238
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:26,638
person, easily.

239
00:35:26,638 --> 00:35:27,638
How?

240
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:35,838
Now it looks very funny that if you like somebody,
if you love somebody, and then you should

241
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,648
get detached.

242
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:41,947
It’s only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:55,728
In Sahaja Yoga your state of mind is such
that you are absolutely detached and absolutely

244
00:35:55,728 --> 00:35:57,628
attached.

245
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:59,538
How?

246
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:14,697
For example now, say I have My daughter, so
I’m detached, I never telephone to her,

247
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:21,668
I am never bothered about her; because in
Sahaja Yoga, you know how is that person.

248
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:25,518
If the vibrations are right, why should you
telephone?

249
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,378
Why should you talk to her?

250
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:29,138
Why should you ask for anything?

251
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:30,138
No need.

252
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:34,488
Only on vibrations you'll know how the person
is.

253
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:38,077
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

254
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:45,888
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing or are indicating something serious

255
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:56,128
about that person, what you will do, you'll
put full attention to that, full attention.

256
00:36:56,128 --> 00:37:02,298
You put attention, but not attachment.

257
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:05,858
So the attachment doesn’t solve the problem.

258
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:09,488
What solves the problem is attention.

259
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:17,318
But when you are not detached, then your attention
is attached attention.

260
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:26,918
It's an attention that is not available to
everyone, an attention that gets stuck, absolutely

261
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:32,298
stuck into that person with whom you are identified.

262
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:34,077
Try to understand.

263
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:42,908
So to be identified with someone is not actually,
what we can say, paying attention to that

264
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:46,308
person.

265
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:47,588
And then your attention will work.

266
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:55,538
If you are of that level, whenever you put
attention to that particular person who needs

267
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,957
your attention, it will work.

268
00:37:57,957 --> 00:38:03,998
But if you are all the time wasting your attention
on a person because you’re attached to that

269
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:11,428
person, your attention will be tired, it won't
work out.

270
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:20,467
It's a big, I should say, a paradox, that
if you are attached to someone, then your

271
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,748
attention doesn’t work.

272
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,128
And if you are not attached to that person…

273
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:29,758
You do everything else: now you have to give
lecture, all right, I’m giving lecture;

274
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:34,618
then I have to do some cooking, I'll do cooking;
this, that, that and that.

275
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:40,028
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person, all the time you want to have

276
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:45,608
connection with that person - it’s not necessary.

277
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:47,967
That person is all right.

278
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,248
What is there to be so much worried about
that person?

279
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:54,578
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things, you have to raise

280
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:56,458
Kundalini of so many.

281
00:38:56,458 --> 00:39:02,827
Now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, it's not a very good thing.

282
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:11,878
By that kind of attachment your attention
also becomes useless, absolutely useless.

283
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:15,447
So let the attention be free.

284
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:23,018
Attention should not be bound by your attachments.

285
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:33,638
Attention should be absolutely free, so it
works automatically, automatically, and you

286
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:41,337
will be amazed, even if you do not pay attention,
the attention will work it.

287
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:49,738
It is such a big thing to have this spiritual
attention, which is nothing but love.

288
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:51,650
It will just act.

289
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,178
You'll be amazed how it acts.

290
00:39:55,178 --> 00:40:03,448
It's another world I am talking about, not
this mundane world but something higher, where

291
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:10,428
your attention works, and works so beautifully
that you are amazed how it has worked.

292
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:15,318
But you should not bound it by your attachments.

293
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:20,858
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere, only the people who are attached to

294
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:25,468
you, or you are attached to those persons.

295
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:39,268
That's why identification is not the way a
guru should work it out.

296
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:47,437
Now there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

297
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:54,378
He thinks this is he is the best, and he should
be encouraged and he should be given all the

298
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:55,788
possible help.

299
00:40:55,788 --> 00:41:00,187
But that’s not going to help.

300
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:05,228
But on the contrary, he should say, “This
is already a good fellow.

301
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:09,148
He has risen already very high, he has gone
very deep.”

302
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:15,358
So pay attention to those who are not so good,
and talk to them about it that “You have

303
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,758
to come up,” in a very sweet manner.

304
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:27,898
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there, or who are still struggling.

305
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:31,858
You have to understand them.

306
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:37,238
You have to notice, what are they doing?

307
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:44,948
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

308
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:50,738
What is the problem, why the Divine is not
flowing through them?

309
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:57,728
And you'll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention, is because

310
00:41:57,728 --> 00:42:01,027
it is focused on someone all the time.

311
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:07,558
They feel that this is their responsibility,
that it should be focused.

312
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:15,528
It's just to give, it's an explanation, it's
just a explanation to say that “You see,

313
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:20,497
naturally I have to be worried about this,
and worried about that.”

314
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,898
It's just an explanation.

315
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:33,007
But if you really don't fix your attention
to one person or ten persons only, then your

316
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:38,608
attention looks after the whole world.

317
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:50,728
It receives all the information, and also
it gives all the information what is to be

318
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:56,588
done to correct the situation.

319
00:42:56,588 --> 00:43:05,208
So one has to rise into that state where you
do not get angry, annoyed, upset - no, not

320
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,698
at all.

321
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:17,738
What happens to you, that you see a situation,
and in that you are not involved.

322
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:24,028
You see the situation and you are away from
it.

323
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:28,308
Then you can solve that problem better.

324
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:33,968
But if you are part and parcel of that problem,
then you cannot solve.

325
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:48,128
It's like this I was telling, that those who
are fighting, say, cannot solve the problem,

326
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:55,878
but a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

327
00:43:55,878 --> 00:44:08,138
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that if you are identified, if you are involved

328
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:19,138
with one person or with one kind of a thing,
then you are lost.

329
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:28,638
So our attention has to be always free and
can be applied widely, wherever needed.

330
00:44:28,638 --> 00:44:30,768
That is the state one has to reach.

331
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:37,738
If you reach that state of mind, it's not
I am saying you can do anything about it,

332
00:44:37,738 --> 00:44:39,618
it’s just a state of mind.

333
00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:43,757
Now, how do we do that?

334
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:49,338
Only through introspection.

335
00:44:49,338 --> 00:45:00,208
Through introspection you will understand
that you need help to solve your problems.

336
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:10,598
Firstly the problem is how to face yourself,
because you are a little bit shy or maybe

337
00:45:10,598 --> 00:45:12,028
nervous about it.

338
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:25,238
As the time comes, you'd be amazed that this
nervousness has no meaning at all.

339
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:39,088
When you try to be deliberate about it, then
it won't work out; but if you are Sahaja,

340
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:40,478
it will work out.

341
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:48,358
So we come to the second point, apart from
the attention, that we should leave everything

342
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:52,997
into the hands of Paramchaitanya.

343
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:55,608
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

344
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:57,588
“This is the problem?

345
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,448
Let Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

346
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:02,948
We are not bothered.”

347
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:05,628
So a detachment comes in.

348
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:13,818
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve, so you are not in it, you are away

349
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:14,818
from it.

350
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:23,788
Very, very simple things are there, that if
you understand that we suffer, because everybody

351
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:28,048
feels responsible for us.

352
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:34,338
Everybody thinks they are responsible, they
have to do this responsibility for us, somebody

353
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:38,368
says this responsibility he has to do.

354
00:46:38,368 --> 00:46:45,188
All these things are worrying them, and that
is the reason today we have a very complex

355
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:47,178
society.

356
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:55,308
They are suffering from all kinds of diseases
in which only thinking is responsible.

357
00:46:55,308 --> 00:47:02,438
By this thinking all the time, thinking about
one person, thinking about one problem, you

358
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:04,408
reach nowhere.

359
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:09,757
At that moment, what you have to do is to
leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

360
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:25,138
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage, It will solve the problem.

361
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:28,838
Now I will tell you one thing, an experience.

362
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:31,138
This time I was in America.

363
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:32,958
I wanted to have a puja there.

364
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:37,018
So I said, "All right, let them come for the
puja.

365
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:41,038
It's nice if they want to come."

366
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:45,178
Then they told Me that "Mother, we want to
bring presents for You for the puja.

367
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:47,868
So how can we bring the presents?"

368
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:50,237
I said, "It's very simple.

369
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:52,038
Don't bring!"

370
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:54,098
But they wouldn't listen to that.

371
00:47:54,098 --> 00:48:01,868
They said, "We'll have to bring, and the Customs
will trouble us and do this and do that."

372
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:10,678
So there was only one building ahead was,
there was another building where they were

373
00:48:10,678 --> 00:48:13,158
having a liquidation sale.

374
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:15,868
I said, "This is something nice!

375
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:18,188
One can have a look at it."

376
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:26,608
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable, very, very expensive things

377
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:28,798
for throw-away prices.

378
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,178
I was amazed how it is there.

379
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:33,868
So I told them, "I can purchase all these
things.

380
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:38,828
I'll pay you, but you bring all these things
to Canajoharie."

381
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:43,247
They agreed, “All right, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

382
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:48,398
And they brought all the things all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

383
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:55,708
We had no problem of Customs or anything;
I paid them there.

384
00:48:55,708 --> 00:49:15,267
How, you see, things can be improved by understanding
what is the most important thing: is to love.

385
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:20,518
But love is truth, and truth is love.

386
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:32,098
If you have love for somebody, genuine love,
then anything you want to do with that person

387
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:39,878
will be absolutely obvious, because it will
be truthful.

388
00:49:39,878 --> 00:49:45,379
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut, because it

389
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:49,108
is absolutely truthful.

390
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:55,938
So when you are dealing with somebody also,
you should be extremely truthful.

391
00:49:55,938 --> 00:50:05,908
Of course, you need not say things that will
hurt him, but you must use such ways and methods

392
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:15,828
that will not in any way hurt the other person,
which will have an effect on that person.

393
00:50:15,828 --> 00:50:22,048
So this kind of a gurus we need now very much
in Sahaja Yoga, because by Sahaja Yoga has

394
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:24,268
spread a lot.

395
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:31,448
So first of all, our temper has to be brought
into proper shape.

396
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:39,348
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru has no business to lose temper at

397
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:42,578
all, on any point whatsoever.

398
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:54,578
If they can really do that much, it will save
our, I mean, so much of worry, so much of

399
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:58,678
problem, so much of mess we create.

400
00:50:58,678 --> 00:51:02,718
All this can be solved very easily.

401
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:10,938
But first we must have pure love in our heart,
not love out of some gain or out of some sort

402
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:18,578
of reward, but pure love if we have, then
we can work it out very easily, anything that

403
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:20,928
you want to do.

404
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:27,868
This is a very lengthy thing which can go
on forever.

405
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:36,718
Because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties and why they are gurus,

406
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:43,838
it’s very important, very important position
that they are gurus.

407
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:53,987
And they should use that position for exhibiting
tremendous understanding of their disciple,

408
00:51:53,987 --> 00:52:00,798
and also their purpose should be clear-cut.

409
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:08,668
People should not doubt him, should not think,
why he is doing such and such things?

410
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:16,958
It should not be a mystery, it should be absolutely
clear-cut.

411
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:26,328
All these things I am telling you today, because
today we have completed ten, our ten years

412
00:52:26,328 --> 00:52:27,968
of stay in Cabella.

413
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:32,198
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me.

414
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:39,918
They have brought lots of people to Sahaja
Yoga, I tell you, very lots of people.

415
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:44,618
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it and said, "Where are You going

416
00:52:44,618 --> 00:52:47,108
to live?" and all that.

417
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:56,068
But here only it has worked, and that should
be accepted as a very good indication that

418
00:52:56,068 --> 00:53:06,267
Sahaja Yoga does miraculous things, miraculous.

419
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:12,428
But the foremost thing is, you must know vibrations.

420
00:53:12,428 --> 00:53:16,428
If you don't know about vibrations, then you
can't do it.

421
00:53:16,418 --> 00:53:21,418
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me, “Mother, very lonely

422
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:24,083
place, there are mafias around.

423
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:26,005
Only six, seven houses there.

424
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:27,489
Where are You going?

425
00:53:27,528 --> 00:53:29,294
What is this?”

426
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:31,989
They all warned Me.

427
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:37,825
So I came here, and immediately I told the
Mayor, “I am going to buy it, and tomorrow

428
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:39,923
I'll pay you the money.”

429
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:46,012
He was surprised: how can I do that?

430
00:53:45,995 --> 00:53:48,001
I said, "Don't worry!

431
00:53:48,196 --> 00:53:50,040
Perfectly all right."

432
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:52,722
On vibrations it was.

433
00:53:52,705 --> 00:54:00,277
On vibrations I decided that this is a wonderful
place.

434
00:54:00,294 --> 00:54:06,310
And vibrations helped Me so much that time,
though everybody discouraged Me and everybody

435
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:09,981
gave Me a very big picture, horrible one.

436
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,756
But still, where is the mafia now?

437
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:15,568
Gone, finished.

438
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:32,317
Now, to know about a thing, you have to meditate
and improve your vision, which should be clear-cut.

439
00:54:32,317 --> 00:54:41,627
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting your particular ideas about

440
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:48,247
a particular thing, but it should be a vision
which should be clear-cut.

441
00:54:48,247 --> 00:55:00,177
With Sahaja Yoga, one has to know the protection
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

442
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:05,757
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

443
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:12,701
I am sure you will get yourself this experience.

444
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:21,771
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga like this
you just get meditative, you just get meditative,

445
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:29,271
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that - just meditative.

446
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:37,004
And this meditative temperament or whatever
is the state, emits vibrations.

447
00:55:37,044 --> 00:55:46,534
It emits and creates path for you, for your
work, for your life, for everything.

448
00:55:46,534 --> 00:55:51,334
You don't have to struggle with anyone, you
don't have to fight with anyone, you don't

449
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:53,774
have to argue with anyone.

450
00:55:53,774 --> 00:56:03,514
Just try to meditate, and achieve a state
which I’m describing to you, where you get

451
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:07,638
completely surrounded by love and affection.

452
00:56:07,684 --> 00:56:13,482
May God bless you all.

453
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:34,404
There's one thing is important to understand,
that you should not go to extremes of everything,

454
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:37,195
which is also a human quality.

455
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:43,754
For example, if they are rational, they go
on rationalizing everything, “I can't do

456
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:44,755
this, I can't do that.”

457
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:46,910
Something like that goes on.

458
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:53,274
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional, and they become so emotional

459
00:56:53,274 --> 00:56:59,664
that they start doing wrong things in the
name of emotionality.

460
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:01,784
You have to overcome these two things.

461
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:05,434
If you have not overcome that, what's the
use?

462
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:08,994
What’s the use of calling yourself Sahaja
Yogis?

463
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:12,113
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

464
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:15,904
Going to the extremes must be avoided.

465
00:57:15,904 --> 00:57:17,853
Keep a watch upon yourself.

466
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:23,524
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out; you might develop cancer, may

467
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,994
develop horrible diseases on one side.

468
00:57:26,994 --> 00:57:33,904
And on the other side you might become a very
rational person, and no Sahaja Yoga will enter

469
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:35,084
your head.

470
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:41,674
So you have to keep the balance all the time.

471
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:48,464
And with that balance, like somebody is a
Sahaja Yogini and she has done something very

472
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:52,524
wrong, then you should not become emotionally
attached, “Oh, Mother, what is it?

473
00:57:52,524 --> 00:57:55,564
And we should forgive her.”

474
00:57:55,564 --> 00:57:56,564
No!

475
00:57:56,564 --> 00:58:06,274
You tell her that “You must improve your
vibrations, and must come to a balance.

476
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:13,702
And once you are in balance, then I will consider
your case.

477
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:16,974
Then I will say it is so or not.”

478
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:24,434
But if she has no balance, she goes into rationality,
she goes into emotional thing, and this emotional

479
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:30,934
business can take you to any nonsensical thing,
as it is a psychological case.

480
00:58:30,934 --> 00:58:36,024
And one can go into very, very wrong things
that they are doing, out of this emotional

481
00:58:36,024 --> 00:58:45,474
thing, you see, like even singing songs that
are neurotic or anything, you see.

482
00:58:45,474 --> 00:58:48,974
All this emotional thing can take you anywhere.

483
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:51,123
So to be emotional is not needed.

484
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:53,924
You must love.

485
00:58:53,924 --> 00:59:00,093
And left side is what you can call another
extreme.

486
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:06,474
One side is, is this emotional, another is
rational.

487
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:11,284
In rationality you can start justifying anything,
like Hitler did.

488
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:15,474
He said, “No, this was right, I was doing
was right.”

489
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:18,204
He took something into his head and now, “This
is right.”

490
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:20,344
This is rationality.

491
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:26,474
So both things are to be properly balanced,
and you should see that whatever you are doing

492
00:59:26,474 --> 00:59:33,853
are giving you a proper result.

493
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:37,684
So thank you very much again and again.

494
00:59:37,684 --> 00:59:45,664
May God bless you.

495
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:53,654
May God bless you.
