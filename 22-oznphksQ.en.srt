1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:09,610
the creation of God is going to get its fulfilment
and is going to know its meaning – it is

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:16,970
that great! Perhaps we do not realise it,
but when we say, “We are sahaja yogis,”

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,579
you have to know that, to be a sahaja yogi,
how much identified you should be with the

4
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:33,390
Truth of Sahaja Yoga, and so many misidentifications
which are hanging on to you must be got rid

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,390
of.

6
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,940
People call it a sacrifice.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,100
I do not think it is a sacrifice.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,870
If you think something is hampering your way
you try to take out that hurdle.

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:54,179
In the same way, if you stand out from your
obstructions, you will be able to understand

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,340
that these obstructions are standing in your
way and they are not your own and that they

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,550
are stopping your progress.

12
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:11,080
So you should get this misidentification out
of your minds completely and try to be more

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,710
and more your Self and not a misidentification.

14
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,110
This is one the problems, I think, people
have here.

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,880
Whenever I get any complaints or anything,
I understand that still the level of understanding

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,520
about Sahaja Yoga is not up to that point.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,740
It is a tremendous task! And for that, if
you are the people who have to come up and

18
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,030
if you are the people who have to fight it,
you have to understand it in its full extent

19
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,700
and also understand where you stand for it:
how much you have to do? how much you have

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,700
to improve yourself? Because you are the people
who are going to take the Sahaja Yoga to that

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,510
position where it has to reach because as
far as I am concerned, I have nothing to do

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,510
anymore.

23
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,510
I have done it.

24
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,729
Now it is for you to receive, you have to
imbibe into it and you have to change the

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,950
whole thing; that is your job and that is
why it is a serious matter.

26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,459
The second point I always have been saying
[is] that, due to ego problem, we are very

27
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,459
much disintegrated.

28
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,319
We are so disintegrated that the connection
with the Divine is never properly established.

29
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,340
As I have said it, that this instrument (microphone)
if it is divided into five parts and all the

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,859
five parts are fighting with each other, you
cannot get anything done through this instrument,

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:39,139
through it is connected to the mains.

32
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,120
In the same way if you still remain disintegrated
you cannot get that connection.

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,670
For example, people come down here, I have
seen, for Sahaja Yoga; now they have other

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,209
interests and there’s other priorities and
other things are there which are very important

35
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,209
for them.

36
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,340
All the time, they are wasting their time
for that, and then they will say that, “Mother,

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,799
we are not progressing much in Sahaja Yoga.

38
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,671
” If you decide, as he (Mr.

39
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:09,829
Venugopalan) has told you that, “We have
to do Sahaja Yoga first and the other things

40
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,830
are secondary,” then only the Sahaja Yoga
can be really established into you.

41
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,780
We’ll have some Sahaja Yogis of a very high
level, I know that, and we will have some

42
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,760
of very mediocre level, some will be absolutely
useless and some would be absolutely thrown

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
away.

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,670
We’ll have all types.

45
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,670
That also I know.

46
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,709
Now it is for you to decide: where do you
come? How far you are going to? If you are

47
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,260
going to waste your time in thinking about
other sahaja yogis and small, small things

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,430
and trivial things as he has said it, your
disintegration is going to be increased, you

49
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,560
are going to [be] separated much more because
all this decision is taken through your ego:

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,729
“I don’t like it, I don’t do it, I don’t
see it.

51
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:59,139
” If you could somehow or other see your
ego working, then you can get rid of it.

52
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,599
And that is the thing one has to do; not to
fight the ego.

53
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,180
I never say, “Fight the ego!” But surrendering
is the only way your ego can go.

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,169
And that’s why the progress in the West,
as you have seen it, is much less than it

55
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,000
is in India.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,720
Now, take his case, I would say, particular
case of [Mr.

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
] Venugopalan: he’s really remarkable because
he is a man who is holding a very big position

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
in India.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,590
Here I see, even if a person is a dishwasher
[and] he comes to Sahaja Yoga, still his ego

60
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,190
is so big [that] even our Prime Minister won’t
have such a big ego as he has! I mean, the

61
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,240
way he will talk that, “I don’t like it,
I do this, this!” I am myself amazed the

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,080
way people [talk]! You see, everybody has
become the King of England or what? The way

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,130
they talk! This is something one should tell
people when they come here, that, “Don’t

64
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,930
waste Mataji’s energies in arguing and this
and that,” because everybody thinks no end

65
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,030
of themselves here, and that is the biggest
hurdle that they have, when they even come

66
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,990
first time, you find it so difficult! I have
to show all my appreciation of their ego,

67
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,280
all the time, just to satisfy them so that
they come round.

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,020
And this is how the progress becomes less.

69
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,210
Now, in his case, (Venugopalan) he is a person
who has been to all kinds of horrible ‘gurus’

70
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,300
and his wife has been also to all kinds of
horrible ‘gurus’ because of another extreme

71
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,889
in India we have, that we must respect all
the saints.

72
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,240
But these days the saints are fake saints,
not only fake saints, but some of them are

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,699
devils! So they are not going to say, “We
are devils.

74
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,880
” When they do not say they are devils or
whatever it is, they do not come in their

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,220
proper form, these simple, innocent people,
who are seeking God, just go to them, give

76
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,030
their heart, do everything and then they find
that they are devils.

77
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,759
Once they discover they are devils, then they
are surprised.

78
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,000
Then they come back from there, they go to
another guru, they go to another guru, but

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,490
the harm is done.

80
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,169
But they get rid of that harm because they
recognise that harm has been done and they

81
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,840
know, what is the Truth is, what is to expect.

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,690
I would say it is the blessing of that country
that people know what to expect.

83
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,490
People would not like to go, those who are
really of a very good quality people, will

84
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,629
not go to a man who shows some sort of a a
sensationalisation or some sort of a chamatkar

85
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:31,030
(चमत्कार) – is a miracle – they
would not go, but they will go to other subtler

86
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,050
people, who are very cunning and they put
up another kind of a show and just say that,

87
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,310
“No, no, this is the way you can achieve
the highest,” and that’s how most of the

88
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,710
sahaja yogis in India also have been – except
for the village people and the district people

89
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,610
– most of the city people have been to some
guru or someone.

90
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,750
But despite all that, they have left everything.

91
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,789
I have told them, “You have to beat them
with shoes.

92
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,230
” They’ll do everything morning till…every
day he does his sadhana (साधना)

93
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,230
for one hour though he’s a very busy man.

94
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,669
Here even to get up in the morning, people
grudge.

95
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:12,620
I mean, what can you do with such slow moving
people? You see, it is absolutely very difficult!

96
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,389
And this is what I feel that we must understand
that we have a very great responsibility,

97
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:26,960
very great responsibility in the West, because
this has to happen in London, it has to happen

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,199
in England to begin with, and that’s why
you bear a very big responsibility.

99
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,450
You have to evaluate yourself and you have
to evaluate Sahaja Yoga, again and again and

100
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,450
again.

101
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,970
And know that what makes you slow is your
ego – or even superego is there, no doubt

102
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,249
– but ego is the main problem.

103
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,370
I must tell you [that] ego is the main problem
but I dare not say to anyone that, “This

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,629
is your ego,” because that will just jump
on to my head.

105
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,759
But try to see your ego, how it is deviating,
because it is your own joy you are seeking,

106
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,790
it is your own property you are seeking, it
is your own that is hidden from you, for which

107
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,160
you have been seeking for ages now; that is
what I have to expose for you.

108
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:18,099
What is there to argue with a person, who
is trying to give you the highest? It’s

109
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,169
just a waste of energy.

110
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,060
Do not waste your energy onto these things,
onto frivolous things, about finding faults.

111
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,289
Now he has been organising our Delhi Camp,
he is the one who has organised our printing

112
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,820
of the book and all.

113
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,540
I have not known any problems there.

114
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,419
You just tell them that, “This has to happen,”
“Alright!” I do not know how it works

115
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,419
out.

116
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,419
You have stayed in Delhi.

117
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,760
You have seen how many people were there.

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,770
Never a problem! Did you hear anybody complaining?
Or anybody quarrelling or fighting among themselves?

119
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:56,930
Nothing of the kind! You see, this is not
the sign of intelligence either; of all the

120
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,110
time trying to find faults with each other
or trying to blame yourself.

121
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,350
Both things are wrong.

122
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,459
Best thing is to grow in wisdom, we must grow
in wisdom.

123
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:15,160
We’ll, ourselves, see that we are becoming
wiser and wiser.

124
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,300
Some of you are really very grown up and some
of you still go up and down, and some of you’re

125
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,620
still very low.

126
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,970
So all of us have to get up and all of us
have to go together.

127
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,930
If somebody has also achieved something it
is of no use to Sahaja Yoga, as I have told

128
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,780
you, it’s a collective thing that is going
to work out.

129
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:41,810
All of you have to work it out and it is so
sweet that you have real brothers and sisters

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,209
all over the world today.

131
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,950
When you’ll go there with the full heart
they are going to receive [you] as you have

132
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,720
received him with full heart.

133
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,990
But we all must come up! Come up to a point,
where we can face each other with full love,

134
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,570
with openness, without any worry about anything,
without any fear of anyone; but just [that]

135
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,700
they are your brothers and you are their brothers
and that you have to love them.

136
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,870
That’s only possible when we’ll get out
of our fears here.

137
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,800
Because there is also another side to it that
ego always has a fear; because it aggresses

138
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:25,839
others it is afraid also because it knows
others can aggress.

139
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,500
So this is a point we have got to think about.

140
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,620
But that never means that in any way despise
yourself, never! You are saints, you must

141
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
know that.

142
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,070
You are realised souls! How many there are
realised souls in this world? How many there

143
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,440
are who can raise the Kundalini? How many
there are who understand what is vibrations?

144
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,380
I’m going to tell you, on Guru puja, what
things you have achieved, and how many things

145
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,000
you have got within you, built-in now, which
are working, and how your chakras are awakened

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,180
through Sahaja Yoga.

147
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,510
As he says, “Yes, it has happened.

148
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,649
” But what are we doing about it? It’s
is the greatest of the greatest that can happen

149
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,280
to anyone; that you know.

150
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:19,829
Also you know this is the greatest happening
which was prophesised long time back as the

151
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,960
Last Judgement.

152
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,420
You know that this is the way you are going
to be judged, so we have to work very hard,

153
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,529
we have to work.

154
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:37,990
It is effortlessly given to you, alright,
but to maintain it, to keep it up to go higher,

155
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,770
we have to religiously work it out with a
very humble attitude – receiving more and

156
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,899
more and more, imbibing it into your being.

157
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,630
Let it trickle into your being, completely
covering it.

158
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,660
Let that joy, that Eternal Bliss come into
you.

159
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,750
I am so anxious for that.

160
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,570
Do not make yourself a small person.

161
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:15,330
Have a bigger vision, have bigger ideas because
now you belong to the Bigger Thing, the biggest

162
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:24,709
of all, the Primordial, the Highest, to the
Viraat! If you realise your importance then

163
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,709
you will work it out.

164
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,670
You see, if you see an Indian Sahaja Yogi,
you will be amazed! He sleeps only for two,

165
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,740
three hours or four hours, but he will not
give up his sadhana.

166
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,480
If he can get his full sleep it’s alright.

167
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,250
First thing he sees is, “One hour for sadhana
in the morning.

168
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,639
I have to get it out somehow.

169
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:51,509
” But sleep? We have been sleeping all our
lives! We have to correct ourselves, we have

170
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:55,889
to rise, we have to go ahead – to achieve
your own.

171
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:02,250
That’s the main point is! See your own selfishness,
I am telling! To know yourself is the greatest

172
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,420
selfishness.

173
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,079
If you do not know yourself, all the selfishness
is useless.

174
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:13,190
As you call a swartha (स्वार्थ),
in Sanskrit it is said ‘swartha’, Swartha

175
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,190
means ‘selfishness’.

176
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,170
If you break it ‘swa’ ‘artha’ – if
you know the meaning of your ‘swa’, means

177
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:24,410
your ‘self’, then it is the greatest selfishness.

178
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,570
So this is what it is and we are very happy
that he’s here.

179
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,660
We’ll be going to India also, next year
we also are planning to go to India and you

180
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
are going to meet [them].

181
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,110
Lots of them may come to Delhi and Bombay.

182
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,779
They are all waiting for you, they are all
planning how to receive you, they are so happy

183
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,390
that so many of Sahaja Yogis from London and
all over will be coming.

184
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,920
And you know how they look after you and how
they are happy and how they are joyous.

185
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,519
And certain things definitely have gone wrong
with us, we know that.

186
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:03,319
We should understand them because these are
the troubles of our over-thinking and over-reading

187
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:07,410
and over-domination but we can get rid of
it very easily.

188
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,910
It is just to detach yourself and see for
yourself addressing yourself, “Now Mr.

189
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:19,330
how are you?” If you say like that, immediately
your attention will go, through yourself you

190
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,600
will see your outer being.

191
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,389
That is very important.

192
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,410
The more you see yourself clearly, the better
it is.

193
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,220
You have to face yourself.

194
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,769
And you do not want to face, you are afraid
of facing yourself, because you have been

195
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,880
aggressing others and you are afraid to aggress,
in a way that is towards yourself.

196
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,870
But there won’t be any aggression because
that’s the perfect state where you see yourself

197
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,860
and neither you aggress anyone nor you are
aggressed by anyone, you just see yourself

198
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
clearly.

199
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
And that is what you have to see.

200
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,199
Gradually you start seeing your chakras, seeing
your problems, your thing and you know that

201
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,930
how, gradually, it develops.

202
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,040
But everybody wants a quick results.

203
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,449
It’s alright, if you want quick results,
alright, are you like that? If you are like

204
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,310
that you will get a quick results; if you
are not, then be patient with yourself, not

205
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,760
with me, but with yourself, I am saying, you
have to be patient, because there is a problem

206
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,190
with you so you have to be patient with yourself
and not with anybody else – that’s is

207
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,190
the main point.

208
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,780
If you are patient with yourself, this is
a long promised thing which you are going

209
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
to get.

210
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,149
But you must learn to be patient with yourself
and not to be angry with yourself, not to

211
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,009
debase yourself or not to aggress yourself
on to others.

212
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:40,350
It’s a very simple thing, it’s the simplest
thing to do, but because of our complex life

213
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:46,170
and our complicated thinking we have become
quite twined up into things.

214
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,720
It can easily be got out of, you can just
slip out of it without any difficulty.

215
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:59,400
I know that you can do it so forget about
all these things like, “My father, my sister,

216
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
my brother.

217
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:09,199
” All these problems will be burnt in no
time as soon as your life runs straight.

218
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,720
Everything will burn away, nothing will be
left but your light and others who will come

219
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,149
to you for enlightenment.

220
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,019
I know that you are going to have a big day
for a Guru puja.

221
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,140
Before that I would request you to prepare
yourself.

222
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:36,220
I may do something great but I must have a
proper recipient so [for] that you must prepare

223
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
yourself.

224
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:45,730
Think about it – are you loving others?
Are you in love? Are you in love with everyone?

225
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,170
Just to think that you love everyone is so
great! I mean you ask me.

226
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,350
Everybody says, “Mother, you look so young!
How do you look?” It’s because I always

227
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,639
think of how much I have to love.

228
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,800
You see, so much love I have to give to others.

229
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,319
Just think how great it is to love others.

230
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:05,880
You know how people treat me sometimes, doesn’t
matter, I’ll still love.

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,630
I enjoy playing with it.

232
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:16,520
In the same way you should love, and love
is the thing that is going to unfold beautifully

233
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,260
like a lotus opens out it’s petals and the
beautiful fragrance starts flowing.

234
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,150
In the same way, your heart will open out
and the fragrance of love will spread throughout

235
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,360
the world, it will ring into people.

236
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,150
I know it can happen, the sooner the better
and the choice is your own which you have

237
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,280
to make a choice.

238
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:47,590
So I’m very happy because such a beautiful
song to hear and just before Christmas which

239
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,610
is a very big thing for me, you know that.

240
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,559
And in the same way we are having another
Christmas now, Christmas to celebrate a new

241
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,919
Christ, born within us.

242
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:10,559
Let us prepare for His coming and how you
prepare is not by running away from yourself,

243
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:18,530
not by getting into frivolous things but by
working it out, beautifully.

244
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:26,150
Cleansing, cleansing has to be done if the
Self has to be established in the temple of

245
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,570
this being.

246
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,990
May God bless you all.

1
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:39,241
Now first before meditating, in your heart,

2
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:45,420
or, you should see in your heart,

3
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:57,692
and there try to put your Guru in the core of it.

4
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:03,303
After establishing in the heart,

5
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,122
you must bow to that

6
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,725
with full devotion and dedication.

7
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:24,709
Now, whatever you do with your mind, after Realization,

8
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:31,976
is not imagination because now your mind, your imagination,

9
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,662
is itself enlightened.

10
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,578
So project yourself in such a way that you humble down

11
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:49,782
at the feet of your Guru

12
00:19:55,204 --> 00:20:10,743
and now ask for the necessary temperament needed for meditation,

13
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:16,676
or atmosphere needed for meditation.

14
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:24,489
Meditation is when you are one with the Divine.

15
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:31,060
Now if there are thoughts coming in,

16
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,246
first you have to say the first mantra, of course,

17
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,463
and then watch inside.

18
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,037
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha, will help some people.

19
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,112
And then you should watch inside

20
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,766
and see for yourself which is the biggest hurdle.

21
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,063
First the thought.

22
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:15,742
Now, for the thought, you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,

23
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:22,809
that, “Twameva sakshat Nirvichar sakshat

24
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,046
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha”

25
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,046
Should say it thrice.

26
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:08,029
Now we come to the hurdle of your ego

27
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,115
because, you see, the thought has stopped now, no doubt,

28
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,637
but there’s still a pressure on the head.

29
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:18,071
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

30
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:23,186
“Twameva sakshat Mahatahamkaara…” – Mahat means ‘the great’,

31
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,641
ahamkara means ‘the ego’  – “…sakshat

32
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:31,021
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”

33
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:34,362
Say it thrice.

34
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,393
Now, even now, if you find that ego is still there,

35
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:25,149
then you have to raise your left side

36
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,799
to push it back to the right hand side,

37
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,898
with your hand; one hand towards the photograph.

38
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:39,650
Push the left side higher and right side lower

39
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,345
so the ego and super-ego get the balance.

40
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,778
Do it seven times.

41
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,553
Try to feel it, how you are feeling inside, you see.

42
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:19,879
Now you raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

43
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:29,641
Again raise your Kundalini up on the head and tie it up.

44
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:36,756
Again raise your Kundalini and tie it up.

45
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:52,289
Now at the Sahastrara you should say the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

46
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,136
Now it’s opened out if you see.

47
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,134
Now you can open again your Sahastrara like this.

48
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:57,851
Just take it down again and see that you are stationed there.

49
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:01,276
Once this has been done then you go into meditation.

50
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:06,695
This is like cleansing, you see, called as nyasa.

51
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:27,310
Now, if you find any other obstruction, you can also say,

52
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,856
like, if you have got, say, Mahakali’s problem,

53
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:34,692
you can say that mantra, clear it

54
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:38,029
and then you sit down for meditation.

55
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,977
Any individual thing, you can take it out,

56
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:52,436
like, if you have the ego problem, if you think,

57
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:54,857
then you should start with Mahatahamkara.

58
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:58,400
It is what you have to find out: What is your problem?

59
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,581
Where is the Kundalini stopping? You can feel it within yourself.

60
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,475
Some of you may not feel.

61
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:35,207
If you do not feel it, feel it on your fingers.

62
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,235
If you are not feeling within yourself

63
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,795
then feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

64
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:46,327
Ah, Better.

65
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,849
How is it now? Better? Where is the problem? Hmm?

66
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,650
Yogi: Central heart

67
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,046
Shri Mataji: Central heart?

68
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,723
Alright, hold your breath.

69
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:23,173
Not with great force, just ordinarily. Alright?

70
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,662
Sakshat Jagadamba 10x

71
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,787
Alright? Leave it.

72
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:55,137
Better now? Once again? Alright, hold your breath.

73
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:57,592
Sakshat Jagadamba… Haa.

74
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:06,567
Leave it.

75
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:18,898
Better. Keep your eyes open. Again. Hold it.

76
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,227
Sakshat Jagadamba…

77
00:29:30,963 --> 00:29:36,185
Leave it. Better now?

78
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:44,964
Much relief. Alright?

79
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:51,826
I mean, now left side. Put your left hand towards Me,

80
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:57,063
right hand up there. Left hand towards Me, right hand like that…

81
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,857
Hmm. Like this. Douglas, like this.

82
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:34,946
Better? It’s liver.

83
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:44,622
Over-thinking gives you liver also. Better.
