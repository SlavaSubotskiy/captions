1
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:47,157
So we are all here now (UNCLEAR) in this sacred
place called Kolhapur.

2
00:03:47,182 --> 00:04:01,489
The Goddess killed the asura called Kolhasura
here, who was a very bad demon, who was born

3
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:06,743
again recently, but he died also.

4
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:11,870
So thank God the death of Kolhasura has taken
place.

5
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:34,993
This place specially is marked because from
the Mother Earth the Mahalakshmi energy was

6
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:39,168
emitted specially from the deity of Mahalakshmi.

7
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:50,563
And as you know that Mahalakshmi is the ascending
power within us.

8
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:53,420
Through which we ascend.

9
00:04:53,523 --> 00:05:04,416
It’s like the staircase which takes you
into the realm of God and so it is very important.

10
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:14,391
And Maharastra’s deity is Vittala, Shri
Krishna, because it is the ascending power

11
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:27,081
of Vishnu through Shri Krishna, then Mahavishnu
and then through Sahastrar.

12
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:33,571
All this is possible because we have got Mahalakshmi
channel within us.

13
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:43,891
If you did not have shushumna we would have
been like animals only.

14
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:52,331
Even animals have this channel up to a point.

15
00:05:52,403 --> 00:06:02,320
As you know they come up to the Void, but
after the Void the ascent as human being starts

16
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:06,839
through this Mahalakshmi energy within us.

17
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:19,256
So this energy is very important and that
one is very much worshipped in this country.

18
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:29,965
First this energy starts working within us
as seeking.

19
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:36,773
Seeking shelter and food.

20
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:46,786
Once the shelter is established, which is
established through the Mahakali shakti, I

21
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:55,300
mean when it is in the heart of an animal
a sense of security is established.

22
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:58,899
Then he starts seeking food.

23
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:10,559
In the same way human beings also, once he
is established in his security, then he starts

24
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:15,548
thinking of feeding himself, looking after
himself.

25
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:23,869
So at the very primitive state the human beings
first tried to establish their security by

26
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:32,909
getting into some caves or some shelters where
they could abide without fear to life, because

27
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,939
if there is no life you don’t think of food.

28
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,858
For example if there is an emergency, we had
a very bad floods in Patna and it was such

29
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:54,328
a bad flood that people had to go in the upper
storey and look after their security, that

30
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,052
was the first thing.

31
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:07,428
Which is such an innate feeling in human beings
to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s

32
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:09,052
powers.

33
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:14,501
And when they went up there, they told me
that they didn’t have food for three days

34
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,446
but they had never thought of food.

35
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:21,133
They never even thought they were hungry,
they were only worried that the water will

36
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:24,849
rise up to that point where they are and they’ll
all sink and die.

37
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,208
So the only worry was that how to exist, how
to survive.

38
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,399
I mean the food question did not come.

39
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:39,479
But when people starve they also start thinking
of insecurity that they may die and they start

40
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,499
thinking about food.

41
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:50,818
So the first security comes in, then the second
comes: the sense of food.

42
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:57,759
In emergency the sense of food that comes
is the beginning, but later on we start putting

43
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,927
our attention to food.

44
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,719
Then the enjoyment of the food.

45
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:08,359
Then discrimination of the food and all those
things you see various things they start coming

46
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:13,174
into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi
tattwa.

47
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:22,339
The more we worry about the food, the more
we worry about the taste of the food, the

48
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:28,509
more we worry about the time of the food,
I mean one can live without food for two three

49
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,485
days very easily, there’s no problem.

50
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,595
But we think that we are used to breakfast
at eight o’clock, we must have breakfast

51
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,158
at eight o’clock.

52
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:42,077
Like Indians are used to their lunch at ten
o’clock, they must have lunch at ten o’clock.

53
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:48,839
This is all our slavery to time, and that’s
how our seeking which is higher, finishes

54
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,839
off.

55
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,052
Then they’ll start talking about food all
the time.

56
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:58,739
This is of course Mahakshmi’s blessings
that you think of food, but she doesn’t

57
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,059
say you get lost in it.

58
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,387
So we get lost with it and once we are lost
with it, then our seeking doesn’t become

59
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:07,011
higher.

60
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:20,149
Our taste habits; we like this, we like that,
this is good, that is bad, we’d like to

61
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,454
have this; still if it lingers it keeps us
down.

62
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:28,493
Whatever we get we should try to eat.

63
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:37,323
Whatever we think good, may not be good for
us.

64
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:41,613
It may be good for the tongue, but may not
be good for us, may not be good from vibrations

65
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:42,767
point of view.

66
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:47,232
So whatever God gives us, whatever is there,
is good.

67
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:49,738
Vibrate it and eat it.

68
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:56,771
Also then the preservation sense comes in
that if you eat wrong type of food, then people

69
00:10:56,938 --> 00:11:02,599
start thinking, that this will also ruin their
security, because they may lose their health.

70
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:09,009
Then they start thinking about, up to a point
is all right, but if you do too much, then

71
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,659
you get out of the circulation.

72
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:16,493
In the sense that if you are flying through…

73
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:20,181
Will you please pay attention here, I’m
surprised that you are

74
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,878
sahaja yogis, how is it your attention goes
to small things like that?

75
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,785
There’s some ladies still looking at that
side.

76
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:41,476
(UNCLEAR) Please try to put your attention
to what I’m saying.

77
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:47,358
Is it important that brother bringing something,
must you see that?

78
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:52,099
I mean this is really silly at this age.

79
00:11:52,124 --> 00:12:00,064
Now you are sahaja yogis, your attention should
be concentrated.

80
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:16,099
So now the attention more goes towards the
acquisition of better facilities for food

81
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:21,189
or better food, whatever you may call for
‘health food’ as you call it and that

82
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:28,165
also if you go too much, you can touch the
banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and

83
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,358
walk through, otherwise how will you move
on the river, that’s the point is.

84
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:36,079
So we start building up that sort of a nonsense
also; this is good for health, this is not

85
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,665
good for health, that is good for health…and
health for what?

86
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,165
For what is the health?

87
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:47,536
Health is for having a good attention, which
you don’t have, is lost in the food.

88
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:53,478
And some people I’ve seen, they are just
still lost in food, completely.

89
00:12:53,478 --> 00:13:01,831
Though they have got a glimpse of sahaja yoga,
but still they are very much attached to food.

90
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:10,248
So that sort of an attitude must be changed,
we should see where we go and get ourselves

91
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,988
attached and lose our attention.

92
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:20,469
This is very important that we should be very
careful about our attention, where is it?

93
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:25,378
So now the attention moves on with that, I
mean those who still move further and don’t

94
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:30,829
jump on the banks, still move in the river,
further on.

95
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:36,549
Attention goes on, then they think that you
see this kind, it works all the time the insecurity

96
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,818
part of it in it.

97
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:44,188
So that this food will be lost, so what should
we do to have better food.

98
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,798
So they start thinking of money.

99
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:51,789
So you know that the barter system became
a system of money.

100
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,988
People started having money.

101
00:13:53,988 --> 00:14:01,829
But then apart from food, clothing, other
things started and people started moving with

102
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,649
it to the Mahakali power more and more.

103
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,875
And the creative power more and more.

104
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,098
The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler,
the movement is also becoming subtler and

105
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:14,123
subtler.

106
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:22,659
So as the man started moving higher and higher,
arts developed on the right side and the idea

107
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,793
of quality of life or quality of security
changed.

108
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,969
So the both the sides becoming subtler and
subtler and the growth becoming subtler and

109
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:40,817
subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler
banks, on the right and the left.

110
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,226
Still you have to move further.

111
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:46,468
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher
and higher.

112
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:50,488
That time then you think you must express
yourself.

113
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:53,909
And the expression starts in arts, culture.

114
00:14:53,909 --> 00:15:02,818
It starts also in your living, in your institutions
of security, like political advancement, political

115
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:10,748
institutions and that’s how human being
reached a point where now they think they

116
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:19,664
have done that was all possible, but still
in a subtler way they are still lost.

117
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:27,254
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa went up to say Christ,
up to that point and still people have not

118
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,436
gone into the subtler side of that.

119
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:39,209
They are still on the banks, moving towards
the banks, not in the centre of it.

120
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:50,139
In sahaja yoga, what happens is that the pure
desire, that is kundalini is kept at the beginning

121
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:55,209
of the life, just at the beginning of the
life.

122
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,639
When you were not even a human being.

123
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:12,329
Even below is carbon and all the journey from
carbon onwards is to be recrossed again through

124
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,571
the kundalini.

125
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:26,509
All this journey that you did on the superficial
level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be

126
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:38,279
redone in the innermost way, to penetrate
through all these subtler centres, which are

127
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,153
inside the stream, not outside.

128
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:46,439
Because if you are on the outside, you always
go to the banks.

129
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:51,388
From where you cannot see any banks, there
is no attention that could be taken to the

130
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:54,819
banks, but you move further.

131
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:57,674
Like a jet.

132
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:08,740
And this kundalini is the one that’s the
true desire, but your attention has to be

133
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:10,518
on the target.

134
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:17,779
Even if you say that the kundalini is the
moving force, still where is your attention?

135
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:23,949
Still your attention is on the banks, so you
come up again superficially, you come and

136
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,639
just float superficially and then again jump
onto some bank and then again I’ll have

137
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:32,123
to put you down inside the water: ‘Go inside,
inside.

138
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:35,711
’ Again go back to the kundalini, again
start your journey.

139
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:46,229
But from the very beginning steadfast if you
move towards the target, towards the spirit,

140
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,948
then I have no problem.

141
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:53,289
But it doesn’t happen with human beings,
they are so much used to the attraction of

142
00:17:53,289 --> 00:18:00,429
the banks that they always come up, float,
go to the banks and again sometimes settle

143
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,448
down there or again come back.

144
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:07,068
So the journey is upward, downward, downward,
upward.

145
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,640
Though the movement of the kundalini could

146
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:12,910
be such that you jump like a jet and set down there.

147
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:18,239
The day that starts I’ll be the happiest
person because it is too much sometimes for

148
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:26,899
me, to make this kind of a journey four times
up and down with everyone, because of the

149
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,999
so called attachments they have outside.

150
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:37,859
The inner movement with a detached mind, if
they accept the situation and they decide

151
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,135
within themselves that I’m going to do like
this,

152
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,857
 I’ve decided on this, they can work it out.

153
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,141
But it’s not so.

154
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:49,560
Mostly the attitude should be that Mother
is like a mirror.

155
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:53,857
And we have a mirror in front of us, so we
know how we are proceeding.

156
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,864
So in the mirror if I see myself like this,
better get rid of it and go on.

157
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:04,023
But on the contrary if Mother says something
to someone, that this is so,

158
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,361
 then they feel hurt and again float up.

159
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,425
The mirror has to say something.

160
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,841
Supposing you have some spot on your face,
the mirror is not going to please you, it

161
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,407
will say it is there.

162
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:19,980
So you don’t hit the mirror and you just
don’t get angry with the mirror, do you?

163
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:24,073
You see that you clear yourself because you
don’t want to have any spots.

164
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,983
But just the other way round.

165
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:30,504
What happens with people I have seen, that
if you tell them anything or you just tell

166
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:36,774
them this is wrong, they’ll first explain,
argue, this thing and if it doesn’t work

167
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,341
out then they will just get angry with sahaja
yoga and you.

168
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:45,525
As if they are obliging sahaja yoga, as if
they are obliging Mother.

169
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,470
Actually you are obliging yourself.

170
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:55,449
You are not obliging anyone or if you take
up that kind of an attitude, then only you

171
00:19:55,474 --> 00:20:00,752
will realize that you have to move forward
without looking left or right.

172
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:06,455
So we have had many experiences, quite funny
if you look back you can see that you have

173
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:13,325
been sometimes Romeo Juliets, sometimes you
have been money minded people, sometimes you

174
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,592
have been quarrelling, fighting, arguing type.

175
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,479
All kinds we have had.

176
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:26,919
But those who forget all this and shoot off
towards the goal

177
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:30,007
are the best and the most   sensible.

178
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,849
They are the most selfish people, because
they know what selfishness is, all the rest

179
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:38,165
are stupid because they are losing their time.

180
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,750
There are some people I’ve seen who also
try to use sahaja yoga for making money or

181
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,713
making something for sahaj yog sort of thing

182
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,801
and making some money out of it or sort of a thing.

183
00:20:51,826 --> 00:21:01,090
You better make yourself is the best way and
enjoy it in a way that makes you happy and

184
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:04,922
makes others happy in the sahaja stream.

185
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:10,574
But getting out of the sahaja stream and doing
something is again coming out of that innermost

186
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:17,697
channel of Bramha nadi, outward, again floating,
going to the banks, again going down, because

187
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:22,347
every time you go down like that you have
to start your kundalini again back.

188
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,808
It’s a very difficult thing.

189
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,369
And the force of the kundalini gets spent.

190
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:33,504
So one has to understand that if you have
to do this journey,

191
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,369
you have to be a determined person.

192
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,263
You have to be a disciplined person, yourself.

193
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:43,058
Nobody should tell you that discipline yourself,
do this do that.

194
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,003
You have to do it.

195
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:48,549
What others are doing, first is the attention
is there, I mean if somebody brings it here,

196
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,120
everybody’s attention must go there.

197
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,095
What is there to see?

198
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:01,663
But this is nothing, this is very, very superfluous
thing, but even serious things should not

199
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,545
attract your attention.

200
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:10,939
Your attention should be on the solution of
all the solutions.

201
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:18,799
Blessing of all the blessings.

202
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:22,291
The emancipation of all the emancipations.

203
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:29,035
You shouldn’t worry about anything else,
you just worry about that connection, which

204
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,548
is being established and nothing else.

205
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,905
Everything is looked after.

206
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,328
It is as simple as that.

207
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:42,213
If this connection is broken the simple thing
is to keep the connection on.

208
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:45,382
What’s the use of polishing this, doing
this, doing that?

209
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,707
Are you going to get the connection back?

210
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:55,182
This is a simple, practical thing we find.

211
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:04,011
And once we start forgetting that practical
side, we become retarded in our progress.

212
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:07,321
And what we find, wherever we are, we are
there.

213
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:11,052
Like in this Kolapur I would say, when I come
you’ll see tonight, there will be a huge

214
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:13,364
crowd, very huge crowd.

215
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:14,736
Always we have.

216
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:19,118
Out of them how many really take up this journey?

217
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:20,143
Very few.

218
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:23,973
Doesn’t matter.

219
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:25,309
You shouldn’t mind it.

220
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,834
Because they are not wise yet.

221
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:34,063
But those who become wise, who take up the
journey, also in between ‘jack in the box’

222
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:35,354
they come out.

223
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,667
Suddenly I find somebody floating.

224
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,865
We are going through the submarine.

225
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,638
And they just jet out.

226
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,610
This is how it has happened with all our journey.

227
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:56,337
And at this place when we are, we have arrived
here not by plane, not by car, not by roads,

228
00:23:56,736 --> 00:24:03,024
but through the innermost core of our heart,
you have arrived, the bramha nadi.

229
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:10,097
We have arrived at Kolapur at Mahalakshmi’s
point, through the most innermost part and

230
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:12,650
that’s how we are here.

231
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:16,901
So we look at this place in a very gross manner.

232
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:20,930
That’s our old habits.

233
00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:25,667
But the new habit should be vibration wise,
where are we?

234
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:26,769
What is it?

235
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:33,574
Once you develop this, we I can definitely
completely transform this Kolapur in (UNCLEAR)

236
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,421
You are like my channels.

237
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:41,673
When you go with me, I use you as my channels.

238
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:46,511
But what I find is that the channels are sometimes
crooked, sometimes broken, sometimes there

239
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:50,047
are holes and the energy is wasted.

240
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:54,297
So it is the duty of all the sahaja yogis
who are travelling with me specially, is to

241
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:57,267
be the channels.

242
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:03,237
But if you take an attitude that you are here
as guests, you have to be looked after, the

243
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:09,255
arrangement should be good, that should be
good, then you have, there is no meaning.

244
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,810
You are travelling.

245
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,328
You are travelling like saints who travel
with Buddha.

246
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:17,881
Even much more, because they did not do anything.

247
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,628
But you are the channels.

248
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:25,062
As you are the channels, you have to keep
your channels open, efficient and you should

249
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,156
work it out.

250
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:36,927
Today is a special day for all of you, is
called as mahabij, the day of mahabij, means

251
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:42,404
all the mantra’s have a bija and mahabija
of that is Omkara himself.

252
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:43,886
Omkar.

253
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:51,710
And it’s the first place, this Omkara was
like an egg, Bramhand, they call it Bramhand.

254
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:55,757
The whole Bramha becomes a anda (egg).

255
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:58,267
Because when they say Bramhand even Sanskrit

256
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,538
people don’t know that they are talking of an egg.

257
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,717
Bramhanda.

258
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:03,693
The anda of Bramha.

259
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:05,207
That is the first bij.

260
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:10,117
And how this Bramha, this vibrations, how
they were created.

261
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:19,837
In the first place, when the Devi separated
from Shiva, before that she had gone around

262
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:23,166
him as you know.

263
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:30,567
And then Shiva told her, Sadashiva told her
that you have to now create.

264
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:33,907
And the separation took place.

265
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:46,407
So he came out of that pradakshina or you
can call it elliptical form and when he came

266
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:54,529
out of it that created a kind of a sound.

267
00:26:54,554 --> 00:27:02,830
A sound that had this Bramha in it.

268
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:08,742
So that Bramha was left in that area.

269
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:18,587
As I have told you that first the Devi went
round Sadashiva and created a garland.

270
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:25,614
That garland had covered Shiva in it.

271
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,508
Like the nucleus inside.

272
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,391
But when Sadashiva went out of it created
a sound.

273
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:47,587
And that sound filled the whole of that andakruti,
means the form of an egg and that is the mahabiija.

274
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:51,056
That is the Omkara.

275
00:27:51,731 --> 00:28:06,531
And that is reborn as Shri Ganesh and later
on as Jesus Christ.

276
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:11,828
That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place you

277
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:16,122
come with mahabija day, is a very significant thing.

278
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:26,588
Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus,
Mary and her son was the incarnation of mahabija.

279
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:32,793
So to come here on such and such day, and
to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja, is a very big

280
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:36,322
privilege, is a great privilege for all of
you.

281
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:48,894
And with that privilege you should humbly
do this puja and try to get into that mahabija,

282
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:54,914
become one part of that mahabija, which is
this Bramhand.

283
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:57,988
The whole Branhand, Bramha’s anda.

284
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:09,797
Anda means egg is created, be part and parcel
of that and not to create any angularity or

285
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:16,813
any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous
with the whole Bramha.

286
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:25,287
One has to put attention to your Bramha Shakti
which is manifested as vibrations.

287
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:31,060
Today the vibrations are so great, that I
didn’t think I would be able to speak on

288
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,909
this, but somehow I have managed.

289
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:37,393
I hope you all have been able to understand
the subtlest of subtle

290
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,297
that I have talked to you today.

291
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:44,258
So when you travel with me you should not
think you have come here to see the whole

292
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:45,492
land and all that.

293
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:46,754
Or to enjoy life.

294
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:53,005
You have come here to become the channel of
your Mother’s work.

295
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:59,151
If you understand that, then you will be able
to realize that God has given you a

296
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:01,267
very appointed place.

297
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,401
So I would request you, be deserving.

298
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,764
Deserve it.

299
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:13,160
Assume your seats, coveted places where God
has put you.

300
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:16,170
May God Bless You.
