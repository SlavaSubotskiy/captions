00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,065
First Public Program in Turkey (Istanbul)
 Emirgan Korusu, 25.06.1989

2
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:35,106
I bow to all the seekers of truth

3
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,120
Can somebody translate me?

4
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:48,102
Gregoire: I can see, they are already in meditation

5
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:24,467
I said, I bow to all the seekers of truth.

6
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:41,832
Now, we have to realised

7
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:45,689
 that truth can not be conceptualized.

8
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:56,426
Truth is and will feel all the time.

9
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:04,499
We can not organize it.

10
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:11,427
And those who are seeking truth,

11
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:15,176
after know that they should keep their minds open.

12
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,577
 Like a scientist.

13
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:26,611
And whatever we are telling you,

14
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:29,763
has to be taken as a hypothesis.

15
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,951
And if it proofs, right, than you have to
 accept it as honest people.

16
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:55,185
Since long there has been talked about truth.

17
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:04,625
Socrates  talked about it
and he was killed.

18
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:15,654
Then came Christ he talked about it
 he was killed.

19
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:26,711
Then came prophet Mohammed Sahap
and he was also in a way killed.

20
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,347
But today the human awareness is much better.

21
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:48,336
And we are understanding that truth has to be

22
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:52,146
beyond our mental projections.

23
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:08,467
When we see those people who talk of peace

24
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:12,681
and talk of any theories of democracy

25
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,623
or capitalism or communism

26
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:30,002
or they talk of any religion like Islam,
 Hinduism, Christianity.

27
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,792
Everyone is the just the same.

28
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:46,306
There is no binding force,
 anybody can commit any sin.

29
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,256
So where are we got wrong.

30
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,478
All these prophets and saints
and incarnations were

31
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:09,423
 absolutely truthful
but where have we gone wrong.

32
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,833
 There is one thing common among all of them

33
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:26,134
that they said, you must see the eternal.

34
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:38,336
And considering things are
 to be used in their moderation

35
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,092
and in their limitations.

36
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:52,310
This is the essence of all the religions.

37
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:02,366
But we have gone wrong
because we did not see later.

38
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,399
And got lost into transitory things.

39
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,377
There was nothing wrong with those

40
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:25,056
who started on these great religions
and great philosophy.

41
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:36,553
But we missed the point.

42
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:43,701
But today the human awareness has reached

43
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:47,360
 the state where it can see so clearly.

44
00:09:54,475 --> 00:10:01,330
That the fulfillment of the promises
 given to us has to be done.

45
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:13,310
It is said that there is the ruh,
the all-pervading power round us.

46
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,141
All the living things
that you see like flowers,

47
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:29,789
fruits and trees and
human beings are miracles.

48
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:40,563
These are worked out.
These are worked out through

49
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:44,204
this all-pervading subtle power.

50
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:59,126
But so far we have never felt it
enmass, this power.

51
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:09,445
Few saints have faith it
but nobody would believe that.

52
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,581
But now a special blossom time has come.

53
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,050
And in this blossom time

54
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:29,311
we are going to find out the truth
without any difficulties.

55
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:38,647
It has should be the easiest thing

56
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:41,411
because it is a living process.

57
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:53,361
But you saw the seed in the mother earth
it sprouts spontaneously.

58
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:08,237
In the same way within us,  this power

59
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:13,235
which I have told you, is described
as al-Asas, (The Foundation) in Koran.

60
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:25,996
In the Bible as the holy ghost.

61
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,497
And in the inner scriptures as Adi Shakti,

62
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:40,901
Primordial Mother as Athina.

63
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:58,639
 Resides in triangular bone called as sacrum,
 meaning sacred bone.

64
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,666
This is the power of God’s desire

65
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:15,639
which resides within us
 as our pure desire.

66
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:33,474
And it spontaneously rises and break
through our fontanel bone area.

67
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:53,798
So actually, you get the actualization
 of your baptism, actualization.

68
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,119
It is not just artificial certificate.

69
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:18,527
Once you become connected with
the all-pervading power

70
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,622
and you become a saint

71
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,343
or you become wali (a Muslim saint)

72
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:36,299
or you become a self realized soul.

73
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,455
As a result of that,

74
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,961
 transformation starts taking place
 in every human being.

75
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:56,369
And this transformation is very unique.

76
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:05,085
Such a person automatically becomes purified.

77
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:15,208
You don’t have to tell such a person, don’t do, don’t do.

78
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:18,130
He just does not do wrong things.

79
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,540
He becomes very dynamic
but very compassionate.

80
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:41,710
And lives in complete joy and peace.

81
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:53,239
All this is your right, as human beings to have it.

82
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:03,240
This is the glory, that is within us.

83
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:16,085
Only, our instrument has to be connected to the main.

84
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:29,465
Also, physical, mental, emotional disorders

85
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,301
 get completely corrected by this power.

86
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:49,262
 And you start feeling this
 formless energy all round yourself.

87
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:03,384
So, you get your enlightenment
your attention becomes enlightened.

88
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:17,278
Now we have here people from,
 I don’t know how many countries

89
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:22,981
who have come to Istanbul to meet you all.

90
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:37,996
It is surprising how it was difficult for

91
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:43,783
anyone of this western country people,
 specially English, French

92
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:47,559
who even pronounce one Indian Hindi word

93
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:52,104
or any other language in Indian language.

94
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,726
But now, these we are pronounce sanskrit.

95
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:12,048
And later all they will be singing Arabic.

96
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,964
Because now they have become universal being.

97
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:25,862
And this is what we have to touch
this our universal being which is the spirit.

98
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:38,557
Now we have people, we have Jews
who worshiped Muhammad Sahap,

99
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,298
who worshiped Christ.

100
00:18:54,332 --> 00:19:01,119
Because through their experience of truth,
they have realized that they were incarnations.

101
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:10,131
All these great incarnations and prophets

102
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:14,887
came on the same tree of life, at different times

103
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:26,815
to give us balance and to save us from evil.

104
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:37,905
But we have plucked the flowers and
 we are saying this is mine this is mine

105
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,291
and fighting with these dead flowers.

106
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,694
 So it is important for all people who are honest

107
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:57,184
and who are seeking the truth,

108
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,485
should achieve their self-realization and see

109
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:05,692
the absolute truth about them.

110
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:19,314
They never talked ill about each other

111
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:26,864
 but only we, in our ignorance do that.

112
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:35,836
So, this light has to come within us.

113
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:42,193
Supposing we are holding a snake in our hand

114
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:47,173
and there is darkness and your eyes are not open.

115
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:51,693
You will not believe, if somebody says
there is a snake in your hand.

116
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:08,942
But if you get the light and your eyes are open up,

117
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:13,939
you will immediately yourself believe that snake.

118
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:26,034
So, a person become so powerful and so free

119
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:33,205
that no bad habits can dominate him.

120
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:53,799
You yourself, become your own master
 and manage yourself.

121
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:03,023
I do not have to tell you, don’t do this and don’t do that.

122
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,712
I am sorry for today’s delay but

123
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:15,969
 you know, there were problems
of traffic and all kinds of things.

124
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:26,502
It was very unexpected.

125
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:34,283
So, I hope, you will excuse me for coming late.

126
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:43,408
Tomorrow of course, I will be here much earlier

127
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:48,093
and explain to you much more about Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:59,167
Sahaja; Saha means with, ja means born.

129
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:12,175
Yoga means union with the Divine with the Ruh (spirit).

130
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:22,083
So, all the human beings

131
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:24,683
 whatever race they will belong to

132
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,138
 have a right to achieve this stage.

133
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:38,111
May God bless you all.

134
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:43,471
If you want to ask me some questions,

135
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:46,928
 I will be very happy to answer them.

136
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,807
Audience: I would like to ask a question.

137
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,785
She just expressed that throughout history,
 important personalities

138
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,618
 have been murdered because of
what they had said.

139
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:37,000
Audience: Why did they get murdered?

140
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,191
Audience:She gave an example.

141
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:41,400
She said that Socrates was murdered
 becasue of his words.

142
00:24:41,425 --> 00:24:44,575
She said that Hazrat Isa Aleyhissellam
 had been murdered;

143
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,311
although I do not agree with this,

144
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:50,399
I wonder for which of his words was

145
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,637
 Hazrat Mohammad Aleyhisselam was murdered.

146
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:20,116
Shri Mataji: No. He was supposed to be killed in the sense that

147
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:24,152
you see, whatever he try to preach and

148
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:28,863
try to do, people would not listen to him

149
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:34,308
and he had to really struggle a lot all his life.

150
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:54,018
Audience: So there is no real act of murder,

151
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:05,944
Shri Mataji: No. Not that way.
That part is not important.

152
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:11,710
 What important part is that
what he wanted to established?

153
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:15,738
In his lifetime, it was very difficult.

154
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:19,566
Because the people were so ignorant.

155
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,261
Audience: Thank you.

156
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:46,650
Audience:  Does the human brain work more
 in Yoga or in sleep,

157
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,502
is there any difference between these two [unclear]

158
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,791
Shri Mataji: What happens?

159
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:15,417
Somebody: The energy wakes up during
the sleep or during a yoga section?

160
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:18,691
Shri Mataji: No during, not during the sleep

161
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,130
but during the yoga section.

162
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:29,375
It is what should understand
why these great prophets came.

163
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,918
Because they had to help us.

164
00:27:32,008 --> 00:27:35,271
In the same way,
 the one who is enlighten,

165
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,773
can only enlighten another person.

166
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:43,192
Like one light, which is enlighten,
 can enlighten.

167
00:27:57,957 --> 00:28:01,584
But that person has to be enlightened,

168
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:04,660
 is the authority that is from God.

169
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:07,688
That he should be enlightened blinds.

170
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:10,975
Blind people cannot give light.

171
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:30,138
Audience: Had Buddha found his true
self and become a mystic?

172
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:32,322
Does she agree with that?

173
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:40,753
Audience:  Yes, had he found his true self
and achieved the true state of mysticism?

174
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,750
Shri Mataji: Yes, he did. One,

175
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:56,085
exceptional case, he proofed the Ruh.

176
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:07,089
 Actually, it was the grace of God
 which worked on him

177
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:12,273
and he was so, so desperate.

178
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:19,762
And he had reached the state where
 he would have committed suicide if he hadn’t.

179
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,436
And when you are enlighten,
you can enlighten others.

180
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:35,660
You all have all the powers to you enlighten others.

181
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:39,044
Like I really don’t do it much.

182
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:44,636
All of them here who are sitting are,
 all I would say, can do it.

183
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:08,763
If that is your capacity that is
your power today. Why not have it.

184
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:18,600
For, you cannot pay for it.

185
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:23,277
You cannot do anything about it.
 Effortlessly you get it. Why not have it.

186
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:39,218
It is so simple as that.
Today we went in the Bazaar.

187
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:46,082
And there was a Armenian boy
who was selling us something.

188
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:49,190
Then he said who are you?

189
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,455
I said, I have come here to give self-realization.

190
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:57,541
He said can you give me now?
 I said yes.

191
00:30:57,726 --> 00:31:01,892
 He just puts his hands towards me
and said,  “ooh I am feeling the cool breeze.”

192
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:45,584
So he wanted to thank me.

193
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,125
I said, this is your own what I have done.

194
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:50,222
Why did thanking me?

195
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:02,243
This all built-in in you it has got.

196
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,435
Alright, tomorrow you will do
 this to the others.

197
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:20,389
Audience: Is Yoga only good for
bringing peace in this world?

198
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:23,804
What are her thoughts about the hereafter?

199
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:59,389
Shri Mataji: See, I have decided
not to talk about myself.

200
00:32:59,432 --> 00:33:05,246
The reason is, see now,
because all of them talked

201
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:09,106
and said often, like Christ,

202
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:12,299
he said, “I am the son of God”

203
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:18,346
and everything he talked is of truth,
so what did they do to them.

204
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,464
But I must be something no doubt.

205
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:39,448
I must be knowing something.

206
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:43,768
But is better, you know yourself,
 then you know me better.

207
00:33:58,465 --> 00:34:01,020
Audience: Can anyone achieve this task?

208
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:14,335
Shri Mataji: Yes of course.

209
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,980
Anyone who has got enlightenment.

210
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,665
Audience: Just a moment,
 I would like to say a couple of things.

211
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,717
From all your speech
and the questions of the participants,

212
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:33,425
I gather that, this meeting gives the sense that,

213
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:37,233
it excludes other religions,
 I think that,

214
00:34:37,265 --> 00:34:40,189
this is how it’s being narrated right now.

215
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:45,176
I kindly request Her to explain
 if this is the case.

216
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,312
Shri Mataji: Of course. It proves.

217
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:18,790
It proves that  truth, of course.

218
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:27,944
Of course. Of course.

219
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,512
All religions are true.
No doubt about it

220
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:37,775
but we have done mistakes.
That is the point I am saying.

221
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:50,212
Audience: This is what I wanted to explain;

222
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,078
that all religions are true,

223
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:54,462
that all of them express the reality

224
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:58,307
but that we make errors while trying
 to understand the religions.

225
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:02,915
So, with your explanation right now,
I should presume that you are trying to fix this;

226
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,111
based on your explanation.
Is this own I should presume?

227
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:16,050
So all of these other religions are in a chaos, [UNCLEAR]

228
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:25,400
but because of this now
we […] they find explanations like yoga.

229
00:36:35,577 --> 00:36:38,600
Audience: Can she tell a bit about the tree of life?

230
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,407
Shri Mataji: I mean tomorrow definitely.

231
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:52,751
I will explain to each and everything.

232
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:57,271
There is going to be no secret
about this knowledge of the roots.

233
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,900
This is the knowledge of the roots.

234
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:04,350
Only we have to become subtle, to feel it.

235
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:09,880
Everything, everything.

236
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:18,316
But this knowledge is love, is compassion.

237
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:30,156
Audience:  What is the thing about Sahaja Yoga

238
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,023
that distinguishes it from
the other methods.

239
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,781
I would like her to give an explanation.
 If you wish […]

240
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:47,808
Shri Mataji: other yogas?

241
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:51,664
Shri Mataji: See. That way, all other yogas

242
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:56,457
 are actually an integral part of Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:09,092
If you do say Hatha Yoga,
in that also, it is first of all, the cleansing

244
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,516
this that and all that and then
 you reach a point

245
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,637
 where you have to take realization.

246
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:27,834
Allright. Now, the second is
you can say, Raja Yoga and all that

247
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:31,258
the way they preach is artificial.

248
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:48,936
Like in Raja Yoga,

249
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:55,808
they say that, you should take
 your tongue backwards

250
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,273
and you should put your stomach
 tight and all those things.

251
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:04,101
But when kundalini rises,
 automatically it happens.

252
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,181
You don’t have to do it.

253
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:27,143
Like when your car starts,

254
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:30,606
all the machinery starts moving automatically.

255
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:33,785
But supposing, you just take
 the wheel and start moving,

256
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,611
the car won’t move.

257
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:59,955
So, one has to understand that
yoga means; union with the divine.

258
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:09,408
Now, the difference is that in modern times ,

259
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:11,851
 nobody has time to go to Himalaya

260
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,398
and sit there for hours together, cleansing themselves.

261
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,881
So, I have found a method.

262
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:31,185
By which first of all raise your kundalini.

263
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:44,583
And most of you, I am surprised,

264
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,521
you get your realization for fix that moment.

265
00:40:58,187 --> 00:41:01,401
But supposing, somebody do not get it fixed.

266
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,570
Then they can see in that little light,
what is wrong with them

267
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:08,685
and they improve themselves.
I don’t have to tell them.

268
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:22,613
So you become your own master.

269
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:30,712
Audience:  In the transcendental meditation technique,

270
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:32,967
when people access a certain consciousness,

271
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:36,279
they rise a couple of centimeters from the ground.

272
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:49,168
Shri Mataji: No. It is all, it is not true.

273
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,715
 It is falsehood.

274
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:57,222
You see, first, you must know that
anybody who takes money from you

275
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,075
in the name of religion,
 in the name of yoga, in anything,

276
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,442
is a false guru.

277
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:18,840
I don’t mind, even they being cheats,

278
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:22,827
but not only they cheat you,
 not only they cheat you,

279
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:25,037
but they spoil your kundalini

280
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:28,334
and they spoil your chances of realization.

281
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,972
We had about only 4 or 5 people only yesterday,

282
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:35,596
who came to us from this TM.

283
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:39,185
Who poor things have become recluses.

284
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:53,917
Also logically,

285
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:57,344
logically we should understand

286
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,352
what is there to get up from the body

287
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:03,466
and to move about. What is the sense?

288
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,408
What is the advantage?

289
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,463
We have to two legs to walk.
 What is the need?

290
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:18,179
It is stupid.

291
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:27,446
All this kind of funny things,

292
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,765
if they tell you,
why should you believe them?

293
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:40,553
No scripture has talked about it.

294
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:46,657
There should be some bases.

295
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:55,577
Audience:  I am sorry,
 here is our friend’s question:

296
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:58,773
there is this one yoga in India,
Marashi Marashi,

297
00:43:58,797 --> 00:44:00,798
their students are doing this thing

298
00:44:00,823 --> 00:44:04,205
but this esteemed lady is saying
 that it’s fake.

299
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,766
Shri Mataji: (UNCLEAR) I have nothing to do with him.

300
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:24,345
Go and see his bank balance. That is all.

301
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:35,523
Please be careful.

302
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:39,424
Please be careful. I am sorry.
They are Indians, I know.

303
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:42,862
I know, they are Indians.
I am very sorry for that.

304
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,874
That is why, I am here to tell you the truth.

305
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:01,035
I have to I would like to warn also.

306
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:11,990
 I have talked about them in 1970,
very openly.

307
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,755
 Very openly.

308
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:26,108
But still people, I don’t know how
they take to him. Because

309
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:30,597
he says that he can make people pay,

310
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:33,472
so people are happy,
I think to pay.

311
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:46,288
Thousands of seekers are ruined.

312
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:00,925
Audience: In short, does she mean fake?

313
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,885
Shri Mataji:  Now one more question and no more. Allright?

314
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:08,106
Because it is getting late now.

315
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:12,237
Audience: I am one of the people who use this technique,

316
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:16,477
they took the money but I am very
satisfied with this technique.

317
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,728
Until now I had a very stressful life.

318
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,095
It had an extremely positive impact.

319
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:44,818
Audience:  There was a mistranslation.

320
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,676
Audience:  I use TM

321
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:50,588
Interpreter: Aa, I am sorry.
I made a mistake. I am sorry.

322
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:56,233
Shri Mataji: I am surprise.

323
00:46:56,249 --> 00:47:00,296
Interpreter:  The lady meant transcendental meditation.

324
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:01,400
Shri Mataji: Of course, I know.

325
00:47:01,474 --> 00:47:04,871
Interpreter:   But she claims that she is quite happy.

326
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:09,191
 I mean, she has been able to redeem
all the stress she had.

327
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:10,736
Shri Mataji: Alright. Then it is alright.

328
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,248
If she thinks so, but I can tell you this much,
 that please don’t come back to me

329
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:16,637
when you will have problem.

330
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:25,427
Moreover, you see.
What power she has?

331
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,294
What has she learned?

332
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,685
Can she give realization to anyone?

333
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,575
It is the point.

334
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:33,448
What is the great transformations she has got ?

335
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:50,854
You see, the mantras,
this gentleman is giving,

336
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:53,148
because you don’t know sanskrit.

337
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:55,954
 (UNCLEAR) one is tinga,

338
00:47:55,979 --> 00:47:58,687
pinga, inga. These are not sanskrit.

339
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,665
He doesn’t know sanskrit, this man.

340
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,663
Tinga means, tinga means when
you show somebody like this.

341
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,633
What do you say it in your language?

342
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,658
Thump

343
00:48:15,713 --> 00:48:17,127
That is tinga.

344
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:18,581
That is the mantra, he gives

345
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:23,131
and 300 pound he charges
for giving such a stupid mantras.

346
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:36,693
And another one he gives is inga,
 meaning sting of the scorpion.

347
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:47,961
And pinga means when you get possessed,

348
00:48:47,986 --> 00:48:51,035
you go round and round like that.
You see that is pinga.

349
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:03,603
I am sorry. I,
 I am not with that, at all.

350
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:09,199
Audience: I hadn’t asked my question.

351
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:12,860
I just shared my own experience.

352
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:14,966
What I am trying to ask is this:

353
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:17,246
the technique that they teach in the society

354
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:19,908
is the special meditation technique of a caste

355
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:23,237
that’s founded on veda science
 that has been applied since 2000 BC.

356
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:28,750
When you apply this technique in return
 for money, is this a right or wrong thing?

357
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:04,359
Shri Mataji:I can give you a complete story about,

358
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,138
if you come and see me.

359
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:09,965
That they started  of course in which people were

360
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,527
stool to be jumping.I have got a

361
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,990
whole coming sorf of a letter from that gentleman

362
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:19,911
whom I have cured also.

363
00:50:20,023 --> 00:50:24,167
And they started course in Scotland.

364
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:28,139
His name was Mr Pitapirs and his wife.

365
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:30,359
She was the granddaughter of a duke.

366
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:34,766
And they became bankrupt
and epileptic, 3 of them.

367
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,579
And I have to keep them in
my own house, to treat them.

368
00:50:38,614 --> 00:50:40,409
And I have got a letter from them.

369
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:42,982
So I mean this is what I am saying that,

370
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:45,952
they go to any guru, let them go.
But then don’t come back to me.

371
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:47,565
Because I headache for them.

372
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,981
I will send you his letter.
You can see it.

373
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:34,161
 Now poor man, he became bankrupt
and he has gone to South Africa.

374
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:48,322
And he is told me that he used to tell that,

375
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,148
he could pass through the wall he could jump up

376
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:55,350
in the air, then all lies.

377
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:58,202
Because he puts so much money in it.

378
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,133
Audience: Also in the society, I am saying this in parentheses,
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

379
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:14,790
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

380
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:17,621
Shri Mataji: Alright now we don’t want to anymore of this TM.

381
00:52:19,773 --> 00:52:23,791
 Now let it be now.
Let us have the realization part.

382
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:25,117
Better.

383
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:26,577
Audience: Excuse me can I have your attention?

384
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:30,947
How are we going to learn this 
system of yoga and how we can apply this?

385
00:52:30,971 --> 00:52:32,702
Interpreter:  We will show tomorrow.

386
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:34,710
Interpreter: Tomorrow,

387
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:36,114
Let us have this please.

388
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:37,658
Interpreter: It got late now.

389
00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:41,824
Audience:We can’t do tomorrow, it will be too crowded.

390
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:47,222
Interpreter:  He has worried that 
tomorrow session will be too crowded

391
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:50,431
and they may not be able to get  realisation.

392
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:52,082
Shri Mataji: get realization. 
So let us have the realization

393
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:55,050
that what I am saying, 
you are reel seekers.

394
00:53:07,056 --> 00:53:10,595
Very simple it is. Very simple.

395
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:13,198
Alright. Now, just think that

396
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:15,799
we have to use the power of the mother earth

397
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:19,428
so we have to take out our shoes. That is all.

398
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:21,492
Take out our shoes.

399
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:30,709
As we take out for any ibadet in centers.

400
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:43,227
And have we put our hands for namaz.

401
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:46,483
Namaz, the thing, Mohammed sahib told you,

402
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:49,295
it was all kundalini awakening. It was all.

403
00:54:01,303 --> 00:54:03,524
Just, everything.

404
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:05,894
Now.

405
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,623
Now before you close your eyes,

406
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:16,466
I will tell you, how to help your centers

407
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:19,484
which are on left hand side. We will work out.

408
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,043
Very simple it is.

409
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,763
First, you have put your left hand towards me

410
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:37,401
which is symbolically. 
This is the power of desire.

411
00:54:37,419 --> 00:54:40,046
So you want to have your realization.

412
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,201
 Now so, left hand towards me like this,

413
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:52,632
simple and the right hand on your heart.

414
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:55,975
Because in the heart resides your spirit.

415
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:02,040
 Left towards me, left, left, left hand towards me.

416
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,718
 Right, right hand on the heart.

417
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:09,882
Right, right.
Alright,

418
00:55:10,112 --> 00:55:15,301
Now, then this is the center where the spirit resides.

419
00:55:20,604 --> 00:55:26,357
Now you have to put your hand in the upper part of
your abdomen on the left hand side.

420
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,895
And then you have to put your right hand

421
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,246
in the lower part of your abdomen
on the left hand side, again.

422
00:55:46,122 --> 00:55:53,499
Now the upper part of your abdomen
is the center of your mastery.

423
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:56,296
Of your mastery.

424
00:56:14,056 --> 00:56:18,071
Now, in the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side,

425
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:22,757
is the center of pure knowledge which

426
00:56:23,134 --> 00:56:26,708
manifests through your central nervous system.

427
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,511
Now,  you put your hand again

428
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:44,577
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side

429
00:56:44,593 --> 00:56:47,339
which is the center of our mastery.

430
00:56:55,922 --> 00:56:59,350
Now, you put your right hand, again on the heart

431
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:01,400
 which is the spirit.

432
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:11,814
Now, the center between the neck

433
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,153
and your shoulder, in the corner,

434
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:19,274
you put your hand and turn your head to your right.

435
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:31,092
Now, this is the center, we catch,
when we feel guilty.

436
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:38,901
You should be very pleasantly place toward yourself,

437
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:44,086
after all you are a human being and if you commit mistakes,

438
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:47,249
after all you are not God.

439
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:07,643
Now, you put your hand on your forehead
 across, and press it hard.

440
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:16,327
This is the center of forgiveness.

441
00:58:21,743 --> 00:58:26,084
Now you put your right hand on the backside of your head

442
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:28,459
and push behind your head.

443
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:40,918
This is the center of asking for
forgiveness without feeling guilty.

444
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,596
Now stretch your hand

445
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:56,671
and put the center of your hand on top of your head,

446
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:01,931
bend your head,
push back your fingers

447
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:07,398
and move your scalp slowly, seven times.

448
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,634
Because there are seven seats of
the seven centers in your brain.

449
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:23,790
Stretch back your fingers.

450
00:59:33,749 --> 00:59:37,740
Now just we have to do it by closing our eyes.

451
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:41,281
You can take out your spectacles.
You have to sit properly.

452
00:59:50,873 --> 00:59:54,126
Keep the legs apart from each other.

453
00:59:54,192 --> 00:59:58,964
Not to sit in a way that you are slouching

454
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:03,688
or too much strain but in a natural, normal, straight.

455
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:18,174
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them, till I tell you.

456
01:00:24,146 --> 01:00:27,058
Now, please put the left hand towards me.

457
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:34,142
 And right hand, on the heart.

458
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:38,846
 Please close your eyes.

459
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:46,186
 Here, you have to say

460
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:50,747
and ask a question to me 3 times.

461
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:53,108
 It is a very important question.

462
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:56,523
Mother, am I the spirit?

463
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,292
 3 times.

464
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:28,615
 If you are the spirit,
 you are your guide,

465
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,877
you are your master.

466
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:33,199
So please put this right hand

467
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:36,162
in the upper portion of your abdomen

468
01:01:36,187 --> 01:01:39,306
and press it hard the left hand side

469
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,539
and ask me a question.

470
01:01:52,755 --> 01:01:55,509
 Here you ask me a question again 3 times.

471
01:01:56,533 --> 01:02:00,894
Mother, am I my own master?

472
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:04,039
Call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suites you.

473
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:25,317
 Now, take down your hand in the 
lower portion of your abdomen

474
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:29,036
and press it hard.

475
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:38,817
 Here, I have to respect your freedom.

476
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:45,125
And I can not force pure knowledge on you.

477
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:52,322
 So, you have to ask me, in your own freedom.

478
01:02:54,948 --> 01:02:57,353
 Please say 6 times.

479
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:02,579
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

480
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,697
 Now,

481
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:19,318
when you ask this question,

482
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:23,734
this force of Kundalini starts rising.

483
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:49,446
 Now, raise your hand

484
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:56,467
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard.

485
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:04,082
 As the kundalini is raising,

486
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:09,205
we have to help with our confident,
 our centers to open out.

487
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:21,105
Here you have to say 10 times

488
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:25,729
Because there are 10 petals to this center.

489
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:37,537
 With full confidence say,

490
01:04:38,363 --> 01:04:43,827
Mother, I am my own master.
Say it 10 times.

491
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:55,127
 This center is created by own prophets.

492
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:10,252
Now, one has to know

493
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,844
that, we are not this body.

494
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:16,576
We are not this mind.

495
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:19,453
We are not ego.

496
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:30,538
We are not our conditionings

497
01:05:30,562 --> 01:05:34,096
but we are pure spirit.

498
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:44,956
So, now, raise your hand onto your heart.

499
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,650
And say with full confidence,

500
01:05:56,227 --> 01:05:59,409
the most important truth about yourself,

501
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:09,805
Mother, I am the spirit.
 Say this 12 times.

502
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:36,074
Now, raise your right hand,

503
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:48,108
into the corner of your neck
 and your shoulder.

504
01:06:53,103 --> 01:06:56,126
One has to know

505
01:06:56,795 --> 01:07:00,916
that Divine is the power

506
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:07,216
of bliss and joy.

507
01:07:13,722 --> 01:07:14,722
But above all,

508
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:23,909
above, above all it is the power of forgiveness.

509
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:33,659
 So whatever so called mistakes,
 you have committed

510
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:38,058
then be dissolved completely into that power.

511
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,356
 So please turn your face to the right.

512
01:07:52,392 --> 01:07:55,626
Symbolically saying that,

513
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:59,761
 Mother, I am not guilty.
Say it 16 times.

514
01:08:22,884 --> 01:08:27,337
Now, raise your right hand

515
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:30,583
onto your forehead across and press it hard.

516
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:40,393
 You may bend your head.

517
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,073
 Here is the center to forgive.

518
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:52,651
You forgive everyone.

519
01:08:56,389 --> 01:09:02,319
So please say with full confidence,

520
01:09:02,743 --> 01:09:06,481
Mother, I forgive everyone.

521
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:19,289
 Many people say that is difficult to forgive.

522
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:24,492
But whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, it is a myth.

523
01:09:33,117 --> 01:09:37,057
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

524
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:46,746
 So please say from your heart,

525
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:49,504
Mother I forgive everyone.

526
01:09:56,937 --> 01:10:02,001
Now, take your right hand

527
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:04,106
on the backside of your head

528
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:07,852
and allow your head to rest on it.

529
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:18,427
Here without feeling guilty,

530
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:23,977
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction.

531
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,644
Please say,

532
01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:42,513
O Divine, If I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me.

533
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:53,942
 From your heart.

534
01:10:57,551 --> 01:11:02,618
 Now stretch your palm and

535
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:09,129
put the center of your palm on top of your head.

536
01:11:11,296 --> 01:11:15,089
 On soft bone which was in your childhood.

537
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:22,422
 Push back your fingers.

538
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:30,429
Now again, I can not force on you,
self realization.

539
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:41,133
 So now bend your head and say 7 times

540
01:11:41,141 --> 01:11:48,591
moving your hand with pressure
your scalp, clockwise.

541
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:02,441
 Mother please give me self realization.

542
01:12:08,452 --> 01:12:10,277
Please move 7 times.

543
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:57,003
Now take down your hands.

544
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:04,581
Put both the hands towards me
 and open our eyes slowly.

545
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:17,620
Now just see, if you are thoughtless,
 you can't see any thought.

546
01:13:21,789 --> 01:13:27,076
Now, bend your head and put your right hand towards me.

547
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:38,009
 And left hand you try to feel
cool breeze out of your head.

548
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:58,023
Now, put the and again put the head down

549
01:13:58,048 --> 01:14:01,064
and put the left hand towards me.

550
01:14:03,676 --> 01:14:07,176
 And with the right hand see again,
 if there is a cool breeze coming,

551
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,247
could be hot also.

552
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:24,732
Now, put the right hand again towards me

553
01:14:24,757 --> 01:14:28,825
and see with the left hand if there is
a cool breeze coming out of you.

554
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:40,818
Now put your hands up in the sky,

555
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:46,510
like that towards the sky, push back
 your head and ask a question.

556
01:14:47,999 --> 01:14:53,675
 Is this the all pervading power of God?

557
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,415
 Is this the Ruh?

558
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:10,925
 Is this the power of love

559
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:19,547
 Now take down your hands

560
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:25,450
You all will feel very relaxed.

561
01:15:29,337 --> 01:15:32,471
 Now those who are felt the cool breeze of their head

562
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,450
and in your hands,

563
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:43,998
like this, so you can feel in the hand of others also,

564
01:15:45,178 --> 01:15:46,245
neighbor’s head.

565
01:15:49,824 --> 01:15:52,197
 Here also, here.

566
01:15:53,314 --> 01:15:55,813
 All of you felt it I know.

567
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:58,959
 So raise your hand, let’s see, both the hands.

568
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:05,752
 Those who are felt  is this, raise your hands.

569
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:15,302
May God Bless you all.

570
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:17,725
So many of you are felt it.

571
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:24,701
Tomorrow again you are coming here

572
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:27,043
And we are going to establish it fully.

573
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:33,830
 You will feel very joyus, very happy.

574
01:16:39,656 --> 01:16:41,942
Tomorrow (UNCLEAR).

575
01:16:50,366 --> 01:16:53,310
 I hope, you will bring your friends.

576
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,190
 You feel very relax, very happy.

577
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:06,485
Especially,  I have seen muslims,

578
01:17:06,493 --> 01:17:10,218
they receiving very fast.

579
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:20,117
Got it, I know you got it.

580
01:17:22,328 --> 01:17:24,830
 Alright. So, please come tomorrow

581
01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:28,512
and don’t discuss it.
 Because this is beyond your thought.

582
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,676
Audience: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

583
01:17:37,775 --> 01:17:39,148
Interpreter Half past six.

584
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:43,362
Shri Mataji:  I will be very early there.

585
01:17:43,387 --> 01:17:45,624
Tomorrow I hope there is no traffic jam.

586
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:50,691
Somebody: Gentleman wants to ask a question, if you don’t mind

587
01:17:50,716 --> 01:17:54,332
Shri Mataji: Please come. Please come. You can come here.

588
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:57,154
Audience: I am asking this so that
 everybody can hear.

589
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:00,229
Shri Mataji: Allright, allright.

590
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:10,940
Audience:  First of all, we are happy
to see her here in Istanbul.

591
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,108
I would like to welcome her.

592
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:23,944
I need to express that in the previous questions,

593
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:27,614
some concepts were indeed being misunderstood

594
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:31,445
and this is because there are a lot of misinformation

595
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,028
 and wrong knowledge around these in Turkey.

596
01:18:50,496 --> 01:18:52,765
Shri Mataji: It is allright but one has to answer.

597
01:18:52,782 --> 01:18:54,479
In fact this is the first time we are attending a meeting like this

598
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:57,190
As Sufis were informed about this but…

599
01:19:01,713 --> 01:19:04,300
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is alright. See I am a mother.

600
01:19:04,316 --> 01:19:06,574
So it is alright. Children must ask questions..

601
01:19:06,606 --> 01:19:10,891
Audience: When we talk about yoga here in Turkey,

602
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,986
maybe she knows about it, there is a famous Yogi Kazim.

603
01:19:14,002 --> 01:19:17,172
He pokes his body with skewers in circuses and stuff.

604
01:19:17,188 --> 01:19:18,800
When we say yoga in Turkey,

605
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:21,970
everybody expects something like this
 because there is such an image.

606
01:19:48,707 --> 01:19:50,254
Shri Mataji: No, austerities.

607
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:53,774
Audience:  For this reason.
When you talk about the yoga technique,

608
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:58,149
there are established prejudices bring in
such associations of meaning.

609
01:19:58,174 --> 01:20:01,930
We listened her and understood that this is not the case

610
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:05,118
but this has to be told to everyone in a very explicit way.

611
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,205
This image must be erased.

612
01:20:21,043 --> 01:20:25,265
Audience:   So just like the merchants in
every religion and every system,

613
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:28,017
because they are the merchants if yoga,

614
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:33,686
I would kindly ask her to be at ease that
she is not being understood in this way.

615
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:35,466
Thank you.

616
01:21:00,704 --> 01:21:05,314
Shri Mataji: You see, there are no
 austerities in Sahaja Yoga.

617
01:21:05,342 --> 01:21:07,612
 No asceticism in Sahaja Yoga.

618
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,788
 No materyalistic life in Sahaja Yoga.

619
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:24,969
 God has created this world, for you, to enjoy.

620
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,788
But in the right way.

621
01:21:34,437 --> 01:21:36,667
 He is your father.

622
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,865
And the greatest of fathers.

623
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,312
 And why he did you guide you to be miserable.

624
01:21:50,414 --> 01:21:55,652
 Actually, he is anxious for you
 to enter into his Kingdom,

625
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:57,749
enjoy his love and blessing.

626
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:07,008
Thank you very much.

627
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:19,544
Beautiful. Very beautiful people.

628
01:22:19,705 --> 01:22:25,272
You got alright. Now, laugh, enjoy.

629
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:18,795
 The problem is that, there was no
one here as Sahaja Yogi.

630
01:23:19,109 --> 01:23:22,108
Now luckily we have a lady

631
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:24,309
whose husband got transport.

632
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:27,838
 See, I could have come much earlier here.

633
01:23:27,863 --> 01:23:29,634
As I have been another country.

634
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:31,834
I have been working now for 18 years

635
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:34,653
but there was no one in Turkey.

636
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:40,722
 So I had to wait for somebody to be here already.

637
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:55,232
 There is a lady who has got transfer here.

638
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:03,501
Now we have here  the lots of people ...

639
01:24:10,981 --> 01:24:11,997
Thank you.

640
01:24:12,022 --> 01:24:13,401
 Thank you so much.

641
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,546
 Thank you my child.

642
01:24:15,571 --> 01:24:17,992
So happy today

643
01:24:19,378 --> 01:24:20,511
May God bless you

644
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:24,121
May God bless you

645
01:24:25,267 --> 01:24:26,400
May God bless you

646
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,331
Look at his eyes. See now his eyes.
 Look at his eyes. See.

647
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:50,106
 Tomorrow hope to see you.

648
01:24:50,115 --> 01:24:52,973
Tomorrow hope to see you madam. Alright

649
01:25:00,127 --> 01:25:02,770
 Thank you. Are you alright.

650
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:11,809
Hello, did you feel the cool breeze.

651
01:25:16,768 --> 01:25:18,839
Audience: Can you please ask what is the meaning?

652
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,354
I got very curious.

653
01:25:20,379 --> 01:25:23,912
But there has to be a difference. Can you please ask?

654
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,542
But there has to be a difference.

655
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:30,749
Can you please ask?

656
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:44,745
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

657
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,115
Interpreter:  The gentleman would like
 to know what exactly is different

658
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:51,250
that he felt heat instead of cool breeze.

659
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,979
Shri Mataji: Still you are feeling.

660
01:25:53,004 --> 01:25:56,400
Little heat in the body instead always
and now they said you can see here.

661
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,777
If you can see here becoming softer, here.

662
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:01,628
And through this all the heat is coming out.

663
01:26:01,652 --> 01:26:03,065
Let the heat get out.

664
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:06,228
And heat will get out.
And you will feel cool better.

665
01:26:06,236 --> 01:26:10,939
Because in the body, in the system
they said heat will (UNCLEAR) go which is together.

666
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:13,005
And (UNCLEAR) due to liver.

667
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,373
And also he has to forgive.

668
01:26:22,389 --> 01:26:25,195
He has to forgive.
I think he didn’t forgive fully.

669
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,331
So please forgive.

670
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:32,796
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

671
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:38,721
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

672
01:26:42,022 --> 01:26:46,610
See now. You not forgive. He did not forgive.

673
01:26:46,885 --> 01:26:48,702
He did not forgive.

674
01:26:49,222 --> 01:26:51,031
Interpreter:  Nice to see you.

675
01:26:51,135 --> 01:26:53,817
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Look at your eyes, sparkling.

676
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:02,000
Nice. Are you alright?

677
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,372
 Hello now, you, young people
 have to take it up. Alright.

678
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:12,608
I am sorry this language, I don’t know.

679
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:25,365
There is young people, I have to know understand and take it out.

680
01:27:42,193 --> 01:27:44,463
