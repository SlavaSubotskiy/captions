00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
 22 September 2001

2
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:04,208
Today we have assembled here

3
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:09,542
to worship Shri Ganesha.

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:19,583
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,333
He is the ocean of innocence.

6
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,375
And though’ he is

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:44,709
such a young, little boy,

8
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:52,291
he can fight the whole world,

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:01:01,458
he can destroy all the negativity.

10
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,709
That’s the sign of innocence.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,667
There have been stories

12
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,709
that children who have fallen from a very great height

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,709
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

14
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:33,542
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

15
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,542
that it doesn’t harm anyone

16
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,166
who is not to be harmed.

17
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,000
It has all the wisdom of the world,

18
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,583
all the understanding of the world;

19
00:01:55,291 --> 00:02:02,208
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

20
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:07,083
the world, the whole world –

21
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:14,083
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

22
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:17,208
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

23
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,542
but they all stand, stand up against

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,208
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

25
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:37,417
You can see in your own lives

26
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:43,417
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

27
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,333
all of the them, whatever they are,

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,208
whatever they are coming from,

29
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,417
whatever maybe their nationality,

30
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:59,333
they all jump, all jump to control

31
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,542
and to safeguard that child.

32
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,083
What is it?

33
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:12,667
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

34
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:18,250
to protect the innocence?

35
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:25,166
It’s really a shame,

36
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,083
a great shame for us,

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,166
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

38
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:41,667
Anything else can be tolerated.

39
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:46,709
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

40
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,417
those who have no malice,

41
00:03:55,208 --> 00:04:02,125
who are living like little children, I should say,

42
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,417
if they are attacked by anyone –

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,709
not that the whole world reacts to that –

44
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:24,291
but everyone of them cannot bear

45
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:31,500
any innocent person or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,709
We don’t realise that within us

47
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,417
there is the ocean of love

48
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,291
and ocean of understanding for children.

49
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Why? Why should it be?

50
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:01,125
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

51
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,709
Especially for innocence?

52
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:12,208
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

53
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,667
innocent children, there are.

54
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:21,375
But no-one wants to support them.

55
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:29,375
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

56
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,542
And those who have done this have to suffer.

57
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,125
They all suffer as a reaction.

58
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,458
What is it within us

59
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,291
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

60
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,583
against innocence?

61
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,250
For example if there is a regular war,

62
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,250
and if there are people fighting;

63
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:03,125
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

64
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,375
In the world also, they say “Alright,

65
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,709
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

66
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:18,417
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

67
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,709
That’s what human beings have.

68
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:29,375
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

69
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,375
which gives you that feeling,

70
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:42,041
that capacity, that understanding

71
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:47,709
that you have to protect innocent,

72
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,333
innocent children, innocent people.

73
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:59,125
And the whole world can rise against all such people

74
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,458
who are trying to kill the innocent.

75
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:09,083
There cannot be any doubt.

76
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:15,417
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

77
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,250
or criticise such a thing,

78
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:22,458
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

79
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:32,709
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

80
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,166
and can give up anything,

81
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,125
but they cannot give up the feeling

82
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,000
they have for innocence.

83
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:50,333
It’s very remarkable. We don’t realise

84
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:57,083
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

85
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,583
for the innocent.

86
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,500
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

87
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:14,583
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

88
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,667
That’s the beauty of human beings.

89
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,667
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

90
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:29,125
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

91
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,667
But when it comes to children,

92
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,542
and to innocent people,

93
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:43,166
everyone feels his responsibility.

94
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,542
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,667
because they have a kind of an understanding

96
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,583
that they are something great,

97
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,500
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

98
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,083
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

99
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,667
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

100
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,083
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

101
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,583
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

102
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,375
and they can never be honoured

103
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,583
for the thing they are doing.

104
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,208
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

105
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:47,375
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

106
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,375
You might feel a little bit cheated,

107
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,291
you might feel a little bit dominated,

108
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,208
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

109
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,625
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

110
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,625
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

111
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,583
They should not feel dejected

112
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:15,166
if they are being used, insulted,

113
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:19,458
tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

114
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,375
They should not try to destroy

115
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,417
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

116
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:35,166
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

117
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:40,542
that when innocence is challenged,

118
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,375
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

119
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:55,709
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

120
00:10:56,542 --> 00:11:01,166
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,583
– have been tortured,have been killed.

122
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:12,625
At that time, all over the world,

123
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,542
it’s a big support for them.

124
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:25,125
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

125
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,583
is anxious to look after

126
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,458
those who have done this crime.

127
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,417
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

128
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,500
they may not be belonging to the same country,

129
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,667
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

130
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,417
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

131
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,542
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

132
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,208
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

133
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,041
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

134
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,000
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

135
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:17,125
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

136
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,083
We should not, in no way punish them.

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,667
Our main achievement

138
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,458
should be that loving attention for children.

139
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:39,500
All over the world, whether he belongs

140
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,333
to your family or to some other family,

141
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,083
or has some sort of

142
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,041
detached attention with you,

143
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,625
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

144
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:07,583
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

145
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,709
will try to protect.

146
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:18,709
It’s very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

147
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,583
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

148
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,417
Children should never be attacked.

149
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,333
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

150
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,125
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

151
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:45,417
that is extremely inauspicious,

152
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:52,500
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

153
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,208
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

154
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,667
I have not come across anyone so far who says

155
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,417
that they don’t love children – luckily!

156
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,709
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

157
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,417
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

158
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,333
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

159
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,583
You love nature – why?

160
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,291
Because it is innocent.

161
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:35,500
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

162
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,583
who are Sahaja Yogis.

163
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,667
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

164
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,250
It’s very easy to be clever.

165
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,083
But to be wise, one should understand

166
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,291
the beauty of being innocent.

167
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,583
Possibly one may say “Mother,

168
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,625
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

169
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,375
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

170
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,166
They may believe that they have done this,

171
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,083
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

172
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,667
It is like a rock.

173
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,500
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

174
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:35,458
any ocean of anger

175
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:41,583
or any kind of revenge.

176
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:48,417
It’s the rock that is being looked after

177
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,542
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

178
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,542
I’ve told you before also,

179
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:01,417
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

180
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,500
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

181
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,709
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

182
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,625
but it does not get,

183
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,458
it cannot get it.

184
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,208
After innocence.

185
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:32,458
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,542
We play with our innocence very much.

187
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:45,250
We think that by behaving any way we like,

188
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:50,625
“It’s alright, after all it’s my own desire, my wish”.

189
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:57,333
And we’ll go on, we go on all the time

190
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,417
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

191
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,375
or covering our power of innocence.

192
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,125
And we think that we have done a great job,

193
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:19,291
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

194
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,375
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

195
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,542
It is not self-sufficient.

196
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,000
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

197
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:44,375
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

198
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,625
which is the greatest faith,

199
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,417
the greatest help

200
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:56,083
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

201
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:01,208
Those people who do not respect their innocence

202
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,667
because they think it makes you weak,

203
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,083
have not seen the power of innocence –

204
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,333
how it works, how it acts.

205
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,625
From all over the world, it reacts.

206
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,500
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

207
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,333
power of innocence.

208
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,250
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

209
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,500
And it acts

210
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:46,625
as if the whole understanding,

211
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:55,083
whole working-out of the be-ing

212
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,333
is so beautifully achieved.

213
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,542
Now you see in this world

214
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,250
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

215
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,333
It is respected the high ideals.

216
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:26,333
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

217
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:34,250
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

218
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,125
of very good nature’

219
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:43,500
– all these people may have been harmed

220
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,208
may have been killed –

221
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:50,333
but because of their innocence they shine,

222
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,250
and shine through ages.

223
00:19:54,458 --> 00:20:00,000
You can see the life of all great men like that;

224
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:06,166
they are all very simple,

225
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:13,375
they are not deliberating anything –

226
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,417
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

227
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:28,667
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

228
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,083
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

229
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,083
Have faith in that.

230
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,458
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

231
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,625
and that ‘yourself’ is nothing but innocence.

232
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,083
You may say that ‘innocent people get cheated’.

233
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,291
Nobody can cheat innocence,

234
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,375
because that is something of very eternal value.

235
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,208
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

236
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:05,166
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

237
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,125
And you will be the most successful person

238
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:15,291
in life when you are absolutely innocent

239
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,291
and your are looking after your innocence.

240
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,125
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

241
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,083
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

242
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,208
by ill doing, it might be covered for the time being.

243
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,458
But if you can take out the clouds

244
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:39,417
away from the sky of innocence,

245
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:43,166
the whole thing becomes so obvious

246
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,291
that you have won the whole world.

247
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:51,125
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

248
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,041
he was insulted, he was tortured.

249
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,208
Those who did this, where are they?

250
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,291
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

251
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,125
Nobody is even bothered about them.

252
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,333
A single one person was so much used

253
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,458
and was so much tortured.

254
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:18,125
But despite that, what has happened?

255
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:22,208
He has got the respect from the whole world.

256
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,542
The whole world respects.

257
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:32,041
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

258
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,667
what has he done …’ Nothing of the kind.

259
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,291
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

260
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:47,208
the essence of complete innocence.

261
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:57,083
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

262
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,125
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

263
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:13,041
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

264
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,208
and we don’t want to even remember that, we don’t want to even

265
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,417
consider that it’s a wrong thing to do,

266
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:26,458
we do not know what is ahead of us.

267
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,083
What happened to Hitler also?

268
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,208
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

269
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:37,000
he can manage to kill so many people

270
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:42,083
and still he will remain a very great personality.

271
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,583
They are stupid not to understand

272
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,583
who are the people really respected.

273
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:53,625
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

274
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:57,041
He didn’t understand if you wanted to have

275
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,667
really the power over the world,

276
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:04,125
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

277
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,709
he should have followed the great people.

278
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,250
And the great people are those who are innocent.

279
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:17,291
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

280
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:23,500
I don’t know how to say that this power acts,

281
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,250
because it acts in so many ways.

282
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:32,625
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

283
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,083
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

284
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:42,667
simple and wise

285
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:50,083
is remembered all your life.

286
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:54,667
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

287
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,417
I used to go to the library

288
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:04,458
and read about the lives of great men

289
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,542
who have created some great things for us.

290
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,083
So many of them.

291
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,125
And I was so impressed

292
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:23,458
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

293
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,375
For example Abraham Lincoln

294
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:33,583
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

295
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,542
was a man tortured by his wife also.

296
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,166
She said “You don’t know, you are very clumsy,

297
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:47,000
you don’t know how to dress up, you don’t know how to behave”.

298
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:56,709
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

299
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,291
Ultimately he was also killed.

300
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:06,709
So one can say, “You see, what’s the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

301
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:14,583
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

302
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,291
Until today, all over the world,

303
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:23,250
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

304
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,333
They don’t know his wife – maybe.

305
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:37,000
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

306
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:42,667
Clumsy man, according to her,

307
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:48,166
and all sorts of degradation for him.

308
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:55,000
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

309
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,375
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

310
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:07,125
Why? ‘Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

311
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,375
that shows that he had no strength to survive’ –

312
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,709
but he survived through ages!

313
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:22,625
So many years have passed, still he’s surviving.

314
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,208
Take the case of all the great people

315
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
who have been innocent;

316
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,041
and that’s why they had ideals.

317
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,291
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

318
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,333
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

319
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,500
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

320
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,125
comes only from your innocence.

321
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:54,333
That’s the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

322
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,500
how you should exist;

323
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,709
what kind of a life you should lead.

324
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:09,291
It is not important that you have big authorities,

325
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,250
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

326
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,500
There have been so many who came and died.

327
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,083
They had so many people with ambitions

328
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:30,041
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

329
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,083
Nobody’s bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

330
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:40,166
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

331
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,166
‘No, no, we don’t want to see this man’.

332
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,083
But if there’s a little boy, innocent child,

333
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,625
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

334
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,125
the whole world admires that child.

335
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,542
And these great men are, really,

336
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:02,542
they are the symbols of that innocence.

337
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:09,083
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

338
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,500
Ganesha’s main quality is his wisdom.

339
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:19,542
He knew what was success, through his,

340
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,458
I should say, innocent qualities.

341
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:29,000
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

342
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,417
quality of innocence.

343
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,709
It’s very surprising how the quality of innocence

344
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:43,208
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

345
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:46,250
who may be very

346
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:58,709
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

347
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,709
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

348
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:09,667
they are innocent! That’s were ends all the glory of human beings.

349
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,291
To be innocent –

350
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,333
What’s the matter?

351
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:25,208
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

352
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:31,250
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

353
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:40,250
Firstly, you can see for yourself

354
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,208
how your mind works.

355
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,125
What does it do? How it reacts.

356
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:56,083
This is what one has to watch,

357
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,667
which I call as ‘introspection’.

358
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:06,166
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

359
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:12,667
What does it think is the best?

360
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,375
In that thinking, thought process,

361
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:25,000
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

362
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:32,125
The first and the foremost is that

363
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,041
you should know how you react to someone.

364
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:44,083
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

365
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,709
It is very easy to see yourself,

366
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,375
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

367
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:56,583
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

368
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:04,417
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

369
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,625
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

370
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,166
What is your behaviour?

371
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:20,625
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

372
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:26,166
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

373
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,000
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

374
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,458
Absolutely stupid.

375
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,250
And when they are doing stupid things,

376
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,291
why should we bother about them?

377
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:40,417
Why should we waste our energy about them?

378
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:48,333
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

379
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:55,000
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

380
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,041
they are treated with contempt.

381
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,709
People don’t even want to take their names,

382
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,333
they don’t want to have their photographs,

383
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,458
they don’t want to have anything to do with them.

384
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,291
At this time, at such a juncture,

385
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:18,417
what happens is the people who are crooks,

386
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:26,208
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

387
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:31,625
they start following them because it suits them better.

388
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:36,625
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

389
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,375
and that’s how a new group is formed –

390
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:43,625
which we can call ‘a satanic group’.

391
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:48,709
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

392
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:53,041
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

393
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,709
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

394
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:01,125
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

395
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:05,041
‘It cannot be killed by any weapon’.

396
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:11,166
Nainam dahanti pavaka – ‘No fire can burn it’.

397
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:16,291
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

398
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:22,208
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

399
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,041
‘Wind cannot also suck it’,

400
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:30,291
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

401
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:36,166
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

402
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,583
I told you, nature is innocent.

403
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,291
It understands and it acts

404
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:50,083
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

405
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:57,667
who is trying to malign

406
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,041
or trouble an innocent person.

407
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:09,333
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

408
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,375
I know sometimes one feels

409
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:15,041
that you are dominated because of that.

410
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:21,583
Sometimes one feels sad that  ‘Why you are put to this kind

411
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,125
of a treatment by others’.

412
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,083
All kinds of things come to your mind.

413
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,250
But if you worship your innocence,

414
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,542
then you will be always a happy person,

415
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:40,041
always a kind person, always be humble person.

416
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,583
So, one has to be careful.

417
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,709
You are your own destroyer!

418
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,542
You are the one who kills, you see

419
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,709
What do you say to it?

420
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,709
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

421
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,458
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

422
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,458
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

423
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,041
So, you kill yourself –

424
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:09,125
through this you can save yourself

425
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:14,125
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

426
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:17,333
Have faith in the power of innocence.

427
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:24,125
What is important is, how you show in your own life

428
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:29,709
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

429
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,709
and that is what is what, is what I call ‘the love’.

430
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,166
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

431
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,291
you have this attitude towards yourself.

432
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,291
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

433
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,458
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

434
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:54,417
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

435
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,166
through your character.

436
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,667
It’s such a transparent thing in a human being

437
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:05,667
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

438
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:13,125
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

439
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:18,583
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

440
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:24,000
and your strength of your innocence.

441
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:28,709
I’m sorry for today’s programme being so late,

442
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,375
but you know I was ready to come

443
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,542
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

444
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,166
Because it came so late,

445
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:47,125
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

446
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:52,083
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we’ll stop it.

447
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:58,291
You must send your applications

448
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:05,000
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

449
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:12,208
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

450
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,583
and you cannot increase those!

451
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:20,166
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

452
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:25,041
that if you want to settle your marriage,

453
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:31,709
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

454
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,333
Otherwise I’ll leave it to others to decide.

455
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,667
If you like, it can be done.

456
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,166
So a simple thing is this to understand,

457
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,000
that marriage is a very important thing.

458
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,667
You can create innocent children if you are married.

459
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:53,709
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

460
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,709
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

461
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:07,000
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

462
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:11,500
if you send your applications so late.

463
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,583
It should be within one week’s time,

464
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,375
I hope you’ll understand that.

465
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you very much.
