1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:25,720
To Truth, Seekers of truth, I bow to all seekers of truth.

2
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:38,035
So far we didn't know that we haven't got only 'truth'.

3
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:46,830
That which our intellect thought perfect, we accepted as 'truth'.

4
00:00:46,855 --> 00:01:00,787
Being misguided this brain started
justifying whatever we did.

5
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:08,539
It is good, it is benificial, we should do this only.

6
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:12,376
Man deviated away from truth.

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,209
After being deviated, it is not known in which ravine he has fallen.

8
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:29,993
On seeing this, people think how did it happen?

9
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,785
Why did such a situation arise?

10
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,732
The wisdom that man has

11
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:45,773
why was that wisdom transformed into stupidity?

12
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:51,009
That which had to be converted into wisdom became foolishness.

13
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:56,036
And that stupidity resulted in such things

14
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:04,886
which neither gives happiness to others nor to his own self.

15
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:10,782
Sometimes we get nervous, when we think what is this going on?

16
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:18,220
There is bloodshed and every type of violence going on.

17
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:22,265
Even the kids are not spared.

18
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:28,797
Many such perversions that have awakened within us

19
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:33,777
keeping that in view, I can say that it is extreme' Kaliyuga'.

20
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,095
This is extreme limit of 'Kaliyuga'.

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,926
It is not even mentioned in scriptures that such a time will come.

22
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,305
They have talked about simple things, I feel.

23
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:56,586
That people will not have their meals in brass (plates)

24
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,889
instead will have it in iron (plates).

25
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:06,513
Many such formal things I think, have been written in that.

26
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:19,025
But the scene before us is horrible and sad.

27
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,962
Behind this one should say, man did not find his path.

28
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:34,067
Marathi

29
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,956
How much he has drifted away?

30
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,829
He cannot get happiness.

31
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:48,555
In search of happiness he ran after the wrong things.

32
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:50,684
This is called 'Mrigh Trishna' (Deer craving).

33
00:03:50,708 --> 00:04:04,961
In this way man after wandering here and there, sank in deep darkness.

34
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:11,975
He doesn't even know that what he is doing, is an evil deed.

35
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:17,855
And the result of this evil deed, he as well as others will get.

36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,996
such things have grown so much that

37
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:27,714
one doesn’t understand what is going to be the fate of this world.

38
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:31,100
There are so many questions in our country.

39
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:33,721
There are so many questions in other countries as well.

40
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:38,856
To think that foreigners are correct, is wrong.

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,581
They are also busy in searching.

42
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:52,369
In that search they want to find, how they will attain that state

43
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:59,258
so that they achieve at least the state of humanity.

44
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:07,497
Whatever is the result of it, is that man gets disappointment.

45
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,201
He feels terribly depressed.

46
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:14,453
He feels what can be done? it will go on like this.

47
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,784
it cannot be set right.

48
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:23,056
On such occassions we should remember

49
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,782
that saints have said,"Search it  inside your being only."

50
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,667
Everything is inside your being.

51
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:39,761
“ Kahe Re Ban Khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi, Sada Alepa, Tohe Sang Smai”.

52
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,912
Who is he?

53
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:48,184
What is it about which all the saints have said in India

54
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:53,586
in foreign countries , in all the religions.

55
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,597
Such misrepresentations of religions also has been, that people forgot

56
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:03,324
we have to search that, which is inside us.

57
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:07,462
And inside us is our spirit.

58
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:16,820
In every human being, this spirit is completely in a living state.

59
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:23,017
This spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

60
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,682
Everybody has said like that.

61
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:28,525
Everybody says that spirit is like that.

62
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,499
But people say that

63
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:32,372
Mother, "we don't know that there is anything like that".

64
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:39,722
Now, your time has come to know what is our spirit, our inner being?

65
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:45,842
And how can we know this spirit?

66
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:53,582
This spirit is as if untouched, watching everything inside.

67
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:59,332
And wraps its own light inside itself.

68
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:00,778
It doesn't do even this

69
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:06,846
that it doesn't even warn us wherever we make any mistake.

70
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:11,676
Because we change our wisdom into wickedness.

71
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:15,935
And we cannot see that we are doing anything wrong.

72
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,810
We do every type of wrong Karma.

73
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:24,578
And we think that we are very nice people.

74
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:29,060
In this way, we lose our power of discretion.

75
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:32,409
Now, we have to achieve this spirit.

76
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:36,683
And how can we achieve this spirit?

77
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,617
This should be understood.

78
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:58,924
For this only, its arrangement is inside your body.

79
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,476
No need to go outside.

80
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:07,353
In your triangular bone only

81
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:12,673
is situated a power called 'Kundalini', a Divine power

82
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:16,462
and when it is awakened

83
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:23,806
it pierces six chakras and then last of all, pierces Bramharandra

84
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:27,169
joins that eternal power(Sukhshm shakti)

85
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:30,711
that which is the, Divine love of God Almighty.

86
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:37,840
It was written so in our Scriptures, but nobody follows it.

87
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:41,166
Many saints of our country went to other countries.

88
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,741
I feel Machinder Nath, Gorukh Naath

89
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:47,540
they must have gone, because in Bolivia they know everything.

90
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:53,474
They know the names of chakras and talk about Kundalini awakening.

91
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,503
I found so in Russia as well.

92
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:02,854
I see everywhere that in the earlier paintings

93
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,502
Whatever the paintings are there, the chakras are made in those.

94
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:15,478
If you travel a little you will be surprised, how did they know all this?

95
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:18,270
And how did they know and who told them?

96
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:26,983
From our country, some saints had gone there, they say like that.

97
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:31,332
And they said so.

98
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:34,326
And told us also.

99
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,999
And they have written also

100
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:41,169
that there is such a Kundalini inside you.

101
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:51,138
Even as much, that these Nath Panthis didn't tell anyone about it.

102
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,629
Because they would think that if they give this (knowledge )to somebody else,

103
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:58,493
The people might use it for what purpose

104
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,261
what they will do and what they will not do?

105
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:03,515
And they are the ones, who read these things

106
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,438
spread all useless notions of the whole world.

107
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,286
And have made it a source of earning money.

108
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:19,272
So, they must have thought, that it is not to be given to ordinary people.

109
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:24,293
But it is written in books in twelfth century.

110
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:28,712
Gyaneshwar ji came and asked his guru

111
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,201
"Please give me permission

112
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:33,242
i want to write about it (kundalini) in my Gyaneshwari".

113
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,695
He wrote about it in sixth chapter.

114
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,884
But during his time

115
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:44,374
it is possible that people earn money in the name of spirituality.

116
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,306
So he said, it (6th chapter) is forbidden, is useless to read.

117
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,533
It is not possible for everybody.

118
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:55,872
Recently, I heard lecture of a great saint.

119
00:10:55,897 --> 00:11:01,506
I was so surprised, how did he? how could he?

120
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,192
You won't understand it easily.

121
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,579
In a way, he abused

122
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:11,075
that you are all 'PRAVRITI MARGI'.

123
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,021
You are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

124
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:19,047
'PRAVRITI' means, your activity of running here and there, you are that.

125
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:20,312
Now tell Me!

126
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,031
And everybody was saying,'yes', 'yes'.

127
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,388
And you are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

128
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:29,059
You don't go to Gyan Marg, because Sahaj Yoga is Gyan Marg.

129
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:34,489
You follow your own ways and serve your gurus.

130
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:39,298
Give them money, do this to them, do that.

131
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,197
And people agreed.

132
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:46,341
If somebody tells anyone, "you are not Nivrit Margi".

133
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,879
In a way, it is like abusing him.

134
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:51,215
But, if a person doesn't know Sanskrit

135
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,419
So whatever they are saying is o.k.

136
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,389
They have made us something.

137
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:59,700
'Pravriti' means running after wrong things.

138
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:06,457
So they told them clearly, you serve all gurus.

139
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:21,815
You get a sac of statues and worship these.

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,060
Now they are sitting since 4o'clock and doing.

141
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,925
Do this fasting , do this penance

142
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,623
They prescribed so many rituals to us

143
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,797
that we were robbed off in that.

144
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:36,645
We could not even understand why are we doing so?

145
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,493
What was its use?

146
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:44,305
Our grand parents did so and we too are doing the same.

147
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,295
And Mohommad Sahab also said very clearly,"Stop worshipping statues".

148
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,988
Because, it is not known who has made these, and why has he made these?

149
00:12:54,013 --> 00:13:08,363
But ask them, why in Mecca, did he ask them to take a round around a black stone?

150
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,138
What was the speciality of that stone?

151
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,523
What was in that stone?

152
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:15,566
He would ask people not to worship statues

153
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:18,456
but why would he make people to take a round around this stone?

154
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:23,931
The reason was that in Mecca, there is Mecceshwar Shiv.

155
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:24,892
He is Shiv.

156
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,316
'Meccashwar' is Shiv.

157
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,936
But, how will you come to know that it is Meccashwar Shiv?

158
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:36,901
How will you come to know which statue is swambhu?

159
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,992
There is an instrument within you.

160
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:43,403
For this reason, when the kundalini gets awakened

161
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:47,221
Crossing the six chakras

162
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:57,259
when it gets one with that 'Divine Energy' which is all around us

163
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:04,092
then, vibrations flow in your 'hands' itself.

164
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:13,634
'Your hands will speak' what is truth and what is untruth?

165
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:20,981
 Such a beautiful arrangement is already there.

166
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:23,106
There is no need to make arrangements.

167
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:29,002
Now your hands speak, means your hands know.

168
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:31,368
This also Mohammed sahab has said that

169
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:34,430
when 'Kiyama will be there, ' your hands will speak'.

170
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,956
Kiyama has come.

171
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:42,385
Now get it.

172
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,785
Does anybody read or not, you don't know.

173
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,165
When your hands will speak, you will come to know from hands

174
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,165
what is wrong, what is right and what is truth?

175
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,462
Now if someone says, what is special about Mecca?

176
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,087
Put your hands towards Mecca. and observe.

177
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:07,834
Those who are Sahajyogis, can see how much vibrations are there.

178
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:15,993
So, what is truth and what is untruth, you can know on your hands.

179
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:19,017
It has a beautiful arrangement.

180
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:23,800
The whole instrument is built within us so beautifully.

181
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:27,034
And when this arrangement is made

182
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,564
When you get it.

183
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:36,142
it is so surprising that your own faults dissolve.

184
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:39,754
You enter into another world.

185
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,370
Lust, anger, attachment, ego, jealousy and greed

186
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:49,906
your enemies run away from you.

187
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,470
Now, it is very surprising that

188
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:55,410
when we had first day programme in England

189
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,457
there six drug addicts came.

190
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,321
They would take drugs.

191
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:03,384
The second day only they got clensed.

192
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,851
It was  very surprising.

193
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,244
How did it happen?

194
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,174
They said,"Don't know.

195
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:12,567
But now we don't  like it, don't like to look at it."

196
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,795
They only transformed into very nice people.

197
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,318
They have implemented and are working a lot  (for Sahajyoga).

198
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:23,870
So this thing which has been said, get your self realization

199
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,779
means know your 'own self '.

200
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:30,323
An arrangement for that too has been made inside our being

201
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:34,362
as if there is some great Divine Instrument inside our being.

202
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:37,916
Or, we can say that there is a machine installed within us.

203
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,176
 And when it becomes functional

204
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,543
when it starts operating

205
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:47,792
then you experience many miracles about yourself only.

206
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:51,980
The drunkards gave up taking drinks.

207
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:57,769
lot of wicked people gave up their wickedness.

208
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:07,059
I went to Tolyatti. There was chief, Don of Mafia.

209
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:10,429
He took to Sahajyoga.

210
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:13,367
I said , "It is a miracle. How did he come to Sahajyoga"?

211
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:17,082
They said,"Mother, he has become a Sahajyogi and wants to see you".

212
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,434
He came and was so humble.

213
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,847
And said,"Mother I have committed many sins.

214
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,474
Shall i be forgiven or not, please tell me?"

215
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,602
I said,"What are you talking about"?

216
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:35,778
The sins you committed are over now, have been in the past.

217
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:40,343
I am talking to you today about the present.

218
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:45,498
That thing is over now, and now what are you in the present?

219
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,117
How much you have transformed, see it yourself.

220
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:54,391
Then, he helped us so much, admired us so much.

221
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,736
In a way, it was so surprising

222
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:04,824
how this leader of Mafia got transformed.

223
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:09,280
How did he accept it?

224
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,250
This happened to him.

225
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:12,687
We did't give him any lecture

226
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,769
neither explained him or told him anything.

227
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,556
It is a happening.

228
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:20,969
And it is very important for this happening to take place in this Kaliyuga.

229
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:27,654
Because, man gets transformed.

230
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,561
And when a person gets transformed

231
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:35,920
he gets so much clensed, he pecomes a beautful personality.

232
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:40,140
Today, world is in need of such transformation.

233
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:46,941
And this transformation, I think, you all Sahajyogis should create.

234
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:51,977
I did as much as I could, went to so many countries.

235
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:56,831
Now you should, those who are in Sahajyoga or are going to join it

236
00:18:56,855 --> 00:19:02,565
they should save other people. and transform them.

237
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,596
Many people have got diverted.

238
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:09,566
Means, they have got diverted in the name of God, in the name of Dharma.

239
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,498
They are diverted in the name of anything.

240
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:18,472
When you will get them into this state

241
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:22,031
you see then, how their nature will change.

242
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:25,167
Here so many lights are on.

243
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:31,019
If these don't have any connection with the mains, can these be on?

244
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:35,702
In the same way, unless our connection

245
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:42,151
for example, this mike is not connected with the mains, it has no utility.

246
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,622
The same is our condition

247
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:50,213
that we are connected to that Divine Power.

248
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:56,170
And the greatest thing is that this 'truth' is 'love'.

249
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,551
This 'truth' is 'joy'.

250
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:23,281
When your attention gets enlightened by the light of this Spirit.

251
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:27,112
If a man gets transformed, how is it going to be problematic?

252
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,547
All the problems are because of human beings.

253
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:34,379
When a human being will get transformed, there will be no problem

254
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,742
there will be no trouble.

255
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:41,653
So, we should think that somehow

256
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:45,808
as much as possible, we should awaken the kundalini of others as well.

257
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,282
And achieve it in this awakening.

258
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:52,216
After getting it

259
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:57,456
you see, I have seen that there is neither any quarrel nor any problem.

260
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,826
The people of any country may come from anywhere

261
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:04,001
 neither they create their Fronts, nor raise the flags, nothing.

262
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:10,625
Just meeting each other, is the greatest joy they get.

263
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,719
It gives great joy when they mix up with each other.

264
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:20,430
It is our nation's culture that there should be brotherhood

265
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:23,528
there should be mixing up with everyone.

266
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:30,410
In every thing we should help each other, this is our culture.

267
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:34,751
But then some strange incidents took place.

268
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:38,178
The country got divided into many sects.

269
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:41,612
So, here also many disputes are going on.

270
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:43,047
wherever we look into, there are quarrels.

271
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:45,556
wherever we go, on one side there is one front demonstrating

272
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,571
and somewhere another front.

273
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:52,612
And take any issue, or in this way any thing

274
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:55,284
they form a coalition and quarrel.

275
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,992
This is not the sign of humanity.

276
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:03,242
Even the animals do not do like that, humans should not do so at all.

277
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:07,627
Human being is the highest category that God has made

278
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:15,991
and has made such a beautiful, complete arrangement inside our being.

279
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:22,085
Has made such an arrangement, that you can get it easily.

280
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,316
And for this you don't have to pay any money.

281
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,373
Like, a gentle man told Me

282
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:33,421
"I will pay you one lac, You awaken my kundalini".

283
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:38,572
I said,"Sir, I will pay you two lac. you stop this conversation".

284
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:42,306
Because Kundalini cannot understand money.

285
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:48,109
Kundalini is a Divine Energy within you.

286
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,432
You must have pure desire.

287
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:54,835
If you don't have pure desire, it cannot be done forcibly.

288
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,963
Money won't work. You cannot compel.

289
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:02,928
If you have pure desire, then only this work can be done.

290
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,821
Now, none of our desires is pure.

291
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:10,962
If it had been pure, your this economics of today would not work.

292
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,790
What is in economics?

293
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:17,317
That today, for example, with great difficulty , you have constructed a house.

294
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:19,354
It has no satisfaction.

295
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:22,933
Then you want a car, that also does not give you satisfaction.

296
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:25,469
Itf you do not get satisfaction in any way

297
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:28,931
that means, your desire is not pure.

298
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:32,509
Had it been pure desire, you would have got satisfaction.

299
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:36,468
But there is pure desire only in one thing.

300
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:46,246
And that is, your own spirit should have Atma Sakhshatkar.

301
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:49,764
The Spirit should be in your attention.

302
00:23:49,789 --> 00:24:02,331
Its light will give you, joy, peace and will give you complete knowledge.

303
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:07,031
But , above all it will make you collective.

304
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:10,873
In this, you become collective.

305
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:22,018
'Collective' means, what we think that we are independant in the world.

306
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:30,042
In the eyes of God, we are in His protection.

307
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,316
It is the idiocy of mind

308
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:34,302
that we are superior, they are of lower category

309
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,961
they are this , they are that.

310
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:38,850
It is all the idiocy of mind.

311
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:43,740
Today, you see, a gentleman had come to see Me.

312
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:49,230
He was the chief of The Militry of Ivory Coast.

313
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:55,587
He was so humble, so humble, that I was surprised.

314
00:24:55,612 --> 00:25:01,309
The chief of that Militry came to Me and Said very humbly

315
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:09,385
"Mother, plz give Sahajyoga to all the people of our country".

316
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,678
I told him,"O.K you only can make them (Sahaj Yogis) all.".

317
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:15,323
He said, "I am in complete joy".

318
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,943
He had divorced three wives.

319
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:24,687
And now he says, "I am ashamed of Myself, what a life i  lived.

320
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:28,907
Why did i make my life such? I can't understand.

321
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:31,944
But now i have changed altogether".

322
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:37,182
And within me, there is so much joy, so much peace and so much pleasure.

323
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:44,238
And now there are 600 Sahajyogis.

324
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:46,551
And now they had adopted Islam.

325
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:49,065
I asked them, "Why did you become Muslims"?

326
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:58,514
He said, "Because these French people have no morality.

327
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:01,383
Morality is totally gone.

328
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:09,079
So we thought, let us adopt Islam, so that atleast morality will remain  in tact".

329
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,469
I said, in Sahajyoga all the religions are equal.

330
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:14,490
And you are above all religions.

331
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:18,365
No religion is disrespected. No religion is lower or higher.

332
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,235
On the contrary, you understand your religion in a better way.

333
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,395
You understand the depth of your religion.

334
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,765
Till now you are wandering.

335
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,292
You can get it, which is reality, for which this dharma has been created.

336
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:38,289
Now a days, they are fighting in the name of Dharma.

337
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:43,292
How is it possible? It cannot be. It is wrong.

338
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:45,147
And it is the wrong thing that is being done.

339
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:50,471
And I will say again that inside us, it is wickedness that is working all this.

340
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,070
Now, even this wickedness of yours is enlightened by your kundalini  .

341
00:26:56,095 --> 00:27:00,480
When it passes through this chakra, which is called Agnya

342
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:06,668
it enlightens it and you understand,"Oh! what was i doing"?

343
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:09,310
Why was i running foolishly?

344
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,913
What was i quarreling for?

345
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:15,532
Unless you know your own self

346
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:22,042
you cannot recognize truth and you will spoil your life in falsehood.

347
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,437
You will spoil your life, your chidren's life.

348
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:28,414
Not only this, but whole nation will get devastated.

349
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,630
Many such nations are getting devastated like this.

350
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:38,545
So, one thing that is in our country and which is very pure

351
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,080
 and that is the awakening of your kundalini.

352
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:44,816
Now, this kundalini is your mother.

353
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:51,264
Your individual mother, it is absolutely your mother.

354
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:53,075
She is not the mother of anyone else.

355
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,164
For example, your mother may have five to six, or eight to ten  chidren.

356
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:00,926
 Of this kundalini, only you are the son, you are the daughter.

357
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:04,383
Now, when this kundalini gets awakened

358
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:13,693
and when it is awakened, it knows everything about you.

359
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:17,014
Inside it, is every thing recorded about you.

360
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,200
What do you want, who were you? What are your problems?

361
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,718
What are the problems of your body?

362
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:28,495
Where, what is the problem, everything is known to it.

363
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:36,554
Managing that , your mother awakens and does not give you any trouble.

364
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:40,602
It is so surprising that not even a bit of trouble you will have

365
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:42,487
 because she is mother.

366
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:47,667
When you were born, your mother took all the trouble upon herself.

367
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,196
She didn't put you to any problem.

368
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:54,734
In the same way, She is mother and when it gets awakened

369
00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:00,000
you do not face any trouble, there is no problem

370
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:03,744
and you achieve an absolutely different state.

371
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,140
And then it is a great surprise that you were like that.

372
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:12,873
All this was within you and you had such a treasure, was totally unknown.

373
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:16,014
And in every way you are benefitted.

374
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:21,026
Foe example, physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual.

375
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,429
These chakras work on all four levels.

376
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:27,956
And this works out on all fronts.

377
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:31,083
There is no doubt about it that after coming to Sahajyoga

378
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:33,996
your health improves and everything improves.

379
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:39,697
Not only this, your financial situation

380
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:40,956
 improves due to the blessings of Lakhshmi.

381
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:45,568
In our country, all those who have become Sahajyogis

382
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:49,091
 most of them have improved their financial problem.

383
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:53,240
Their behaviour improved, their disputes are over and every thing.

384
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:56,972
Because this power is spread all around.

385
00:29:56,997 --> 00:30:00,944
Everywhere it pervades and is working.

386
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:10,042
And with the help of this power, not only our betterment

387
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:15,136
but leads to a special type of dignified life.

388
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,621
Such a life, looking at it we say, there is such a person.

389
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:23,985
We would say like this, for saints.

390
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,654
Today there are so many people in Sahajyoga

391
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,810
and so many have come to Sahajyoga.

392
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:32,109
The reason of its spreading in so many countries is that

393
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,587
a type of depression in all the countries

394
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:42,290
a type of disappointment and secondly, lot of violence has increased.

395
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:48,704
Among those who thought that it is wrong, joined Sahajyoga.

396
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:53,022
They say, Sahajyoga has spread in eighty six countries.

397
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:56,729
Although, I have not been to so many countries, is a fact.

398
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:01,846
But, just as a seed wherever it falls, can grow into a plant

399
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:05,182
in the same way, Sahajyoga has spread.

400
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:10,242
It is so surprizing that people from there come to this country

401
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:16,306
and even they come to Italy, but I have not yet gone to their countries.

402
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:19,638
And may be I might go sometime.

403
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:28,415
But their love, their mutual love and mutual mixing up

404
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,913
one gets surprized on seeing that they have, even for one single person.

405
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:36,169
Recently, when there was bomb blast in Bombay

406
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,546
there was a boy.

407
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,845
He would always say, Mother, "I don't want to live

408
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,142
my mother is very bad, like this, like that".

409
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,769
He would say so repeatedly, and that boy only died.

410
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:54,619
This news spread in all the countries

411
00:31:54,644 --> 00:32:01,477
and all the people ran, and found out this, that.

412
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,529
Then, there they told them that they are saints.

413
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,254
So they said that we will give you a piece of land

414
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,282
 you cremate or bury the dead body if you want, here itself.

415
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:14,643
Such people sent letters there, that I was amazed.

416
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:20,692
After this, recently I saw that My brother, Baba Mama expired.

417
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,820
He loved people very much.

418
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:28,717
So many people have sent faxes, that I could not go through these till now.

419
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:34,699
So much love, such good talks about him, people have written about him.

420
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,685
I was so surprized.

421
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,500
I wouldn't think that his love had so much got distributed among people.

422
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,871
So many people loved him!

423
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:50,594
So, this whole environment of love in which everybody loves you

424
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,932
you too will love everybody.

425
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:56,005
This is the greatest thing about Sahajyoga

426
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,790
that the power of Sahajyoga, is the 'power of love'.

427
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:03,096
And no other power can overpower it.

428
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,925
There is no greater power than this.

429
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:11,143
  You are enveloped in the greatest power of love

430
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,003
and you are always protected.

431
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:20,384
Nobody can touch you, because God loves you.

432
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:28,111
Who dares to go against Him? Who could be hostile to Him?

433
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,755
We have so many examples

434
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,665
that people say,"Mother, how was i saved, can't understand".

435
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,379
"How did i get the blessings? i don't know".

436
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:41,400
After you listen to all these things, you also feel very happy.

437
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,902
Because they are all your brothers and sisters

438
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,846
they are all yours.

439
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:51,195
And seeing to that , it appears that the world is going to change.

440
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,687
We will have good time, very good time.

441
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:04,641
In that people will always

442
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:10,716
work for a great nation, a great personality and a noble cause.

443
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,699
This has to happen and is happening

444
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:16,412
but still many people have to be transformed.

445
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,315
Transformation is very important.

446
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,506
and till now you are living as human beings

447
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,879
but have even fallen to a lower level than humanity.

448
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:26,819
Their transformation is very easy, achieve that.

449
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:30,715
There is no other way than transformation.

450
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,835
And that happens by kundalini awakening and by nothing else.

451
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,208
Now if somebody asks

452
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:42,924
"Mother, if we put this mike in water, will it work? No".

453
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,227
Or, if we burn it, will it work? No!

454
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,680
You have to reconnect it then.

455
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:53,974
You don't have to pay anything, you have to give nothing

456
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:56,746
but a little bit of time to yourself.

457
00:34:56,771 --> 00:35:01,912
And wherever is your center, go and attain more depth.

458
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:07,357
Many people follow it very little, and that is why they do not grow.

459
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:13,784
Unless you give collective love to it

460
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:18,108
as you have to water your plants and trees

461
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:23,060
the same way if you don't do so, your plant will not grow.

462
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:29,016
And that is why Jesus has said, that some seeds fell on stones

463
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:33,676
some seeds fell on ground and died there only.

464
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:38,404
But some seeds were such which fell and remained in the fertile land

465
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,529
sprouted and became trees.

466
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:46,015
So we do not condemn any religion, nor oppose any religion.

467
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,206
The essence of all religions is their speciality

468
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:56,141
and there is such a strong connection in all these religions

469
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,777
that will be established.

470
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:07,789
A very great joyful, comfortable, such a life for you in future

471
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,491
is ready for you.

472
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:25,658
You get it, This is My eternal blessing to you!

473
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:31,765
I am very sorry that I had to speak in Hindi language

474
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,360
because most of the people understand Hindi here.

475
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:41,453
And you have heard me many a times in the English language.

476
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:45,961
Moreover, I found you all meditative just now enjoying

477
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:48,012
the world inside your heart, I think.

478
00:36:48,037 --> 00:37:01,585
And it was very kind of you! Thank You!

479
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,815
Now I want to tell you that

480
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:16,592
those who don’t want their kundalini to be awakened please go out.

481
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:19,781
Because this is not a pageant

482
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:22,988
and those who want to go in for meditation

483
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:29,365
you , in a way create problems for them.

484
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:35,521
So, those who don’t want to meditate, can please go out.

485
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,716
So, you will understand

486
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:43,114
that it is not your responsibility to sit here.

487
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,643
You have come here, it’s ok, you have listened to the lecture, it is o.k

488
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:52,031
but if you don't want awakening of your kundalini, you can go out.

489
00:37:52,056 --> 00:38:11,370
Nobody will feel bad about that.

490
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:21,680
The land on which you are sitting is very sacred land of India.

491
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:25,561
Your 'Bharat Bhumi' is  'Yog Bhumi"

492
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:28,284
You don't know its importance.

493
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:34,716
Those who come from foreign, they on the airport itself

494
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:39,864
offer 'pranams' bow down to this land and touch it.

495
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:46,065
And say, –“Mother how these vibrations are flowing in this land”!

496
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,084
You are not aware of it but be aware of it today.

497
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:52,898
Once I was travelling by aeroplane.

498
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:56,928
I told to my husband that, we have reached India.

499
00:38:56,953 --> 00:38:58,338
He asked me, "How did you know"?

500
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,893
I told him, "Vibrations are flowing in all the directions".

501
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,972
He enquired from the pilot.

502
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:05,715
And he told him, "Yes Sir, wo have reached India".

503
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,486
This is your India.

504
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:14,591
And I have lot of respect for that person, and also recognize him

505
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,972
who is a patriot.

506
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:19,961
Patriotism is very important for us

507
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:22,977
because, our country is a special country.

508
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:25,307
Such a country is nowhere in world.

509
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:28,374
If you have no respect for your land

510
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,910
you cannot have your Kundalini awakening .

511
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:36,110
The kundalini of whole universe is in this country.

512
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:40,360
It is so surprizing, that till now you are ignorant about it.

513
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:43,211
But the power of this country is great

514
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:47,943
and one day, the whole world will bow down to you

515
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,181
because we are very powerful.

516
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:56,997
They will bow down with love and respect

517
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,243
not with the might of the sword.

518
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:07,448
Because the people of this country, have eaten the grains of this land.

519
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:09,024
 And it is in their blood.

520
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:12,038
So, 'Desh Bhakti' (Patriotism) is very important for us

521
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:14,739
especially for Sahajyoga.

522
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:17,901
Even as much as, the people who have come from foreign countries

523
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:20,534
 have a great respect for India.

524
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,466
Even they have fixed maps of India at their places

525
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:28,472
and photos of the great personalities of this country

526
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:29,799
have fixed in their own houses.

527
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:34,141
And they respect all the Gods and Goddesses

528
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,732
because they are residing in their chakras.

529
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:45,830
So, we should understand that in a way, unless we have

530
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:52,929
knowledge about the speciality of our culture and our country

531
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:55,809
till then, we cannot even love our country.

532
00:40:55,834 --> 00:41:02,548
So, you must think that you are very lucky

533
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,758
that you were born in this country.

534
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:10,292
You are very fortunate to be in this country.

535
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,770
This land is 'SASYA SHYAMLA' (Lush green and cropwise rich).

536
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:15,726
We cannot say anything else for this country.

537
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:21,297
Just now, I told you about your kundalini awakening.

538
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:23,678
Every body is sitting, and nobody has gone.

539
00:41:23,703 --> 00:41:28,479
That means you want your realization.

540
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:35,619
So this is a very good thing. And it’s very encouraging to see this.

541
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:38,914
O.kay! it is very easy!

542
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:42,047
You are Indians and you are sitting on this land.

543
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:44,223
For you it is not difficult at all.

544
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,613
At other places My hands break.

545
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:53,501
But God has given such a speciality to Indians of spiritual life

546
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:58,577
that they find no difficulty and this work is done very easily.

547
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:09,477
Now, you put your both the hands towards Me.

548
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:13,604
Don't close your eyes. Please don't close your eyes.

549
00:42:13,629 --> 00:42:26,685
Just keep both the hands towards Me.

550
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,435
Now, please put your left hand towards Me

551
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,984
and right hand on the top of your head.

552
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:43,611
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Fontanel bone

553
00:42:43,636 --> 00:42:49,981
above the bone which is a soft bone in the childhood.

554
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:55,226
And move your hand, above, below, on both sides.

555
00:42:55,251 --> 00:43:03,577
And check, if there is any cool or hot breeze coming out of it.

556
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:05,571
This has been called 'Spand.'

557
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:12,724
Check, if there is any cool or hot breeze.

558
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:18,217
Now put your right hand towards Me.

559
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:21,260
I am saying 'Right' and 'Left' in English

560
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:26,291
because in Hindi language, every where it is spoken in a different way.

561
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:28,954
Put your right hand towards Me

562
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:33,967
and with left hand check over the top of your head, bend your head.

563
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,308
Bend your head and check.

564
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,563
Please bend your head and see for yourself

565
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:44,523
if you are getting cool breeze or hot breeze from your Fontanel bone?

566
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:51,080
Check! Some feel it much higher, some feel it in different directions.

567
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:54,507
But you feel it.

568
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,117
You must experience it.

569
00:43:57,142 --> 00:44:02,890
It is an experience. Without experiencing, you should not believe in anything.

570
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:10,201
And now put your left hand towards Me and check with your right hand

571
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:19,119
that from your head, if cool or hot breeze is coming?

572
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:25,450
Now, hot breeze is coming, because you have not forgiven anyone till now.

573
00:44:25,475 --> 00:44:30,134
You have to forgive yourself as well as others.

574
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,683
You just say,"Mother, i have forgiven everyone

575
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,857
and forgiven myself as well".

576
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:51,135
See, you will be surprized, that cool breeze has started coming.

577
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:58,593
Now, put your both the hands towards Me.

578
00:44:58,618 --> 00:45:00,604
Both the hands.

579
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:06,012
And try to be thoughtless.

580
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,791
Be in thoughtless awareness.

581
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:14,161
Because thoughts only make us stupid.

582
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:33,908
You be in thoughtless awareness.

583
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:45,341
Now those who are getting cool breeze in their hands or fingers

584
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:50,141
or cool or hot breeze on their palms

585
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:56,369
or cool or hot breeze from head

586
00:45:56,394 --> 00:46:02,190
all those, raise your both the hands.

587
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:06,665
I am saying , those who get cool or hot breeze

588
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,988
Wow! Whole Delhi of yours!

589
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:14,289
Wow...........what to say!

590
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,156
Eternal blessings to all of you!

591
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:20,700
From My heart, I say, eternal blessings to you!

592
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:25,544
Whole of Delhi has got it. what else do you want?

593
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:31,818
Eternal blessings! Eternal blessings!

594
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:33,590
May God bless you all!

595
00:46:33,615 --> 00:46:45,195
You all got realization. The whole of Delhi, imagine!

596
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,193
Now, you have to meditate a little bit.

597
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:53,434
Now for that, there are centers everywhere.

598
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:58,167
You will have to meditate, for 5-10 minutes, not more than that.

599
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:01,738
And after that you see your condition, how you will be.

600
00:47:01,763 --> 00:47:04,085
You will be feel joy.

601
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:08,486
You will be drenched in the big ocean of joy.

602
00:47:08,511 --> 00:47:11,339
The drop will become an ocean.

603
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:13,034
You will enjoy yourself.

604
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:41,566
My love and eternal blessings to everyone!

605
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:45,264
Now they want to sing a song.

606
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:50,017
I had written this song in twelfth century.

607
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:54,048
Even now , it is sung in villages in Marathi language.

608
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:58,383
They are saying, they will sing that song.

609
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,836
In that song, kundalini has been called as 'Amba'

610
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:07,338
and it is said, "Amba get awakened".

611
00:48:07,363 --> 00:48:11,663
People don't know what it is!

612
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,430
They have been singing it for the past so many years

613
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:19,710
but they don't know what they are singing! what are they saying!

614
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:24,617
It is such a beautiful description.

615
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:31,556
 God! I have cleansed myself, now awaken this 'Amba'.

616
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:49,701
This 'Amba' is the kundalini and awaken it.
