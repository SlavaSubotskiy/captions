1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:23,880
on the easter day we give people eggs to

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:31,980
remind them that you are egg now when

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:36,810
you have to become the bird but I don't

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,880
think people know that because

5
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,880
resurrection is the message of Christ

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,489
Lucy fiction is the compliment

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:57,359
accomplishment but resurrection is his

8
00:00:47,489 --> 00:01:04,280
message and it is a very significant

9
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:12,270
thing and it is written in one of the

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:16,409
ancient scriptures in India why Easter

11
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,430
should be celebrated with an egg is most

12
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,790
surprising was clear it's very clear

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:32,659
that if one can see how Christ is

14
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:36,240
symbolized as an egg now what is an egg

15
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:41,610
in fact it's the language a branding is

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:46,590
called as three Jaya he Jaya theme means

17
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:50,280
the one who is born twice and a bird is

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:55,950
also called any bird is called as a

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:02:00,149
divita means twice for because first the

20
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:05,310
bird is born as an egg and then reborn

21
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:12,620
as a bird in the same way a human being

22
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:15,620
is born as an egg and then is born as a

23
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,620
realized

24
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,260
now see how significant it is that both

25
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,840
are called by the same name no other

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,930
animal is called as visa unless and

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:36,370
until it has an egg form first and then

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:40,049
it comes out as a another thing for

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,049
example no mammals

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,459
none of the mammals are called as DJ

31
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,120
except for human beings it is remarkable

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,459
in the zoology if you read that a

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,189
mammals do not lay their eggs they give

34
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,549
birth directly to their children and we

35
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:04,930
are also mammals but despite that human

36
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:07,260
beings are called as V jaha just like

37
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,260
birds

38
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:20,260
so that means human beings when they are

39
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:27,459
born are eggs or they become eggs how do

40
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:30,370
they become eggs is the way our ego and

41
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,930
superego develop within us now you all

42
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,079
being only sahaja Yogi's I think you

43
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:42,310
understand what I am saying when the ego

44
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:47,889
and super-ego when the ego and super-ego

45
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:54,159
there's no chart is it develop in a

46
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:56,199
human being to the full extent and the

47
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,349
fontanel bone area is completely

48
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:05,790
calcified then you become an egg you get

49
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:11,829
completely separated from your mother

50
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:17,079
from all pervading power of God and you

51
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:19,150
are left to yourself as an egg till you

52
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,740
make sure within yourself inside the

53
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:29,430
shell of the egg in your freedom to a

54
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,430
point where you are ready for hatching

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,340
the mother bird has to pierce in the

56
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,490
head of them egg and you come out as

57
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,370
first you are already there inside

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,350
developed and then you fly out into the

59
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,740
space of all-pervading power of divine

60
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,740
love

61
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:03,910
so how significant is Easter and why

62
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:09,700
Christ he came on this earth because he

63
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:14,470
had learnt the idea he had practiced the

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:26,650
idea or we can say that he was an expert

65
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:32,350
on this that he could himself surpassed

66
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:38,740
that hurdle by which he becomes worthy

67
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:42,490
job but he was that already but how are

68
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:47,770
you to believe that you can be Regis you

69
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:51,610
can be reborn it was said by every

70
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:55,570
religion by every prophet that you are

71
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,880
to be born again unless and until you

72
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,740
are reborn

73
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,400
that means baptism not this kind of

74
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,550
baptism but the real one unless and

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,470
until this shell is broken on your

76
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:14,050
fontanel area you cannot become the

77
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:19,350
region it is written in all the

78
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:22,120
scriptures said by all the prophets

79
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:26,860
somebody had to show you that this can

80
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,980
be done he he being the divine power

81
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,990
itself the Pranava she being the brahma

82
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:39,370
itself his rebirth was resurrection

83
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:43,110
bodily resurrection while yours is the

84
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:51,720
resurrection which is

85
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:57,740
in your consciousness and you see it

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:00,389
clearly this is what is Easter is I

87
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,249
wonder how many Christians know the

88
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:08,989
significance of an A

89
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:14,629
it signifies a stage where you are

90
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:17,959
before realization when you are in your

91
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:22,459
action that you are mr. a exactly this

92
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:27,259
is why all that but when you mature will

93
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:30,799
be inside the bird is ready and that is

94
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:35,689
the time you are hatched this is the

95
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:38,419
time you get twice born so actually the

96
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:44,209
resurrection of Christ signifies that

97
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:46,610
and that's why we give that it people

98
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:52,269
say you are anything reminder of that

99
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:55,189
and this egg can become respect and also

100
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:58,699
it is written that he was an egg when he

101
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:04,989
came first one taken as an egg half of

102
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:08,959
it remain as Ganesha and half of it

103
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:13,929
became harsh - then he came on this

104
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:19,240
earth I departed with all these elements

105
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:25,630
pure vibration found his body

106
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:31,660
he remained there using all of you to be

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:35,349
awakened and when the kundalini takes

108
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:40,330
your attention through that point there

109
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:43,630
you also become the spirit that's why I

110
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,700
said that I am the gate

111
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,020
I am the dope fiends I am the

112
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:53,860
destination he said I am the door

113
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,510
because you cannot become Christ that's

114
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,620
why he is saying I am the destination

115
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:05,070
that you have achieved but he has

116
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:09,730
created this space for you can become

117
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:14,800
spiritually awakened you can become

118
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:18,160
useful but Christ is an incarnation he

119
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,790
was the son of God and so he's an

120
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:26,170
incarnation and that incarnation came on

121
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:30,329
this earth just to pull you out of your

122
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,329
elements make you become
