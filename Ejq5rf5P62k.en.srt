1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,959
Oh! Very beautiful.
Who's done it?

2
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:11,208
You did?

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:17,458
Very good,very beautiful,
absolutely good.

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,500
Everything.

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,875
What's her name?

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,583
Sue Williams.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,417
Thank you very much,
very beautifully done.

8
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,792
You can't move further?

9
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,667
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

10
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:12,291
and there should not be
controversy between you.

11
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:20,417
You should all think of
the same thing, isn't it?

12
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,417
I feel sorry so many
standing outside.

13
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,333
Come in, come in!

14
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,041
Can you move
the piano behind?

15
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,500
You are from Como?

16
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,333
See! He could come!

17
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,542
I'm happy to see all of you here.

18
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,875
May God bless you.

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,208
You are so many.

20
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,834
And you can afford to have a hall,

21
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,333
all of you sitting there,

22
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,999
and I feeling comfortable.

23
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,500
After all, you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

24
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,542
all brothers and sisters.

25
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,959
and you don't mind
any inconvenience,

26
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,333
but if we can make
something convenient,

27
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,583
we should do it.

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:11,583
No,no, I have no trouble, I have
come all the way from India!

29
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:26,125
For My convenience you

30
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,125
take no such a note.

31
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,166
See, wherever you are, wherever
you have the programme,

32
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,709
I'll go there.

33
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,834
As long as possible
I will definitely go.

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,375
These days, life is much
more comfortable

35
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,542
but when I was working
in the villages.

36
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,500
I used to go on
the bullock cart.

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,583
You've got photograph,
you can see

38
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,792
- on the bullock cart to go
for miles together.

39
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,250
I knew I had to
do all that.

40
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,125
If I have to get Sahaja Yogis,
I have to work that way.

41
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,959
And I was
quite prepared.

42
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,709
I never felt any
exhaustion

43
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,500
with it, never.

44
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,917
On the contrary, after I meet
you all I feel so happy.

45
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,375
Now, is there somebody
who has problems?

46
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,542
Anybody -  who
has problems...

47
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,875
Alcohol, drinking,
alcohol.

48
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,125
They are not in
Sahaja Yoga? - No.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,166
Why not? You are
the mother?

50
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,458
Yes...and
my husband.

51
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,542
How about
the children?

52
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,750
I have two
children with him.

53
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,999
The children are...are they
Sahaja Yogis your children?

54
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,125
Not, the two older
children not.

55
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,750
How many children
you have? - Four.

56
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,291
Four children,
four children

57
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,709
They are not
Sahaja Yogis?

58
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,583
Only my two
young ones.

59
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,166
Two young children in Sahaja Yoga and the
two older ones are not in Sahaja Yoga,

60
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,542
husband is not
in Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,041
Surprising.

62
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,166
But here the family system is
good compared to, say, in England,

63
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:07,834
where the family breaks
after some time.

64
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,834
At least here,
is much better.

65
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,333
Shri Mataji, we in America
have a problem,

66
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,250
that the seekers don't
stay in Sahaja Yoga.

67
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:39,917
The seekers take their
realisation in America, and they don't stay in Sahaja Yoga.

68
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,375
This is our problem.

69
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:45,250
They don't stay.
Yes, Shri Mataji.

70
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,917
Why?
I don't know Shri Mataji.

71
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
It's not complete.

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,125
If they have a complete
realisation,

73
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,917
they will
have to come.

74
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:08,000
They are not complete.
Just half way.

75
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:16,291
They drink? Yes, Shri Mataji.
- That's the point.

76
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,709
After coming to Sahaja Yoga
you cannot drink

77
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,792
Yes, Shri Mataji

78
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:28,250
And that must be the reason
they don't want to come.

79
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,917
But you give them bandhans.
And beat them with shoes.

80
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,458
Who are those...
your mother, father?

81
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,667
My mother, my father,
yes. My good friends

82
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:50,125
- they take realisation but they
don't stay as Sahaja Yogis.

83
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,166
Because they drink.
- Yes, Shri Mataji.

84
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,000
See now

85
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:07,375
all your countries have
indulged into drinking.

86
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:13,250
All over Europe, you see,
and it's a little fight,

87
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,500
because for them
drinking is their life.

88
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,959
We have to give
them bandhans.

89
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,709
If you give them bandhans,
all of you put together

90
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,000
then they cannot
run away.

91
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,875
Bandhan has
to be given.

92
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,750
All of you should
give bandhan.

93
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,041
That's how they have
worked out in India.

94
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:59,208
And India is, you know, how
Sahaja Yoga is strong there.

95
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,291
The reason is
if they find

96
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,750
parents are not coming, or maybe children
are not coming or whatever it is,

97
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,000
they all work it out

98
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,000
by giving them
bandhans.

99
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:21,875
But first thing, you should
regularly come to SahajaYoga.

100
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
Regularly.

101
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,542
It is not half way,

102
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,333
like today you come and
then you don't come.

103
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,291
That's not proper.

104
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,041
That's - you
cannot progress.

105
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,208
You have to come
to the programmes,

106
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,166
all of you, regularly.

107
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,875
Because you know,

108
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,917
realisation is
not easy thing.

109
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,959
Nobody had it
before.

110
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,166
Now you have got it.

111
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,250
So you have to maintain
it and keep it up.

112
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,750
Once you start
developing that

113
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,458
the female of
the house also changes.

114
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,375
Greatest problem
of Europe is

115
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,583
- real problem, that
they drink.

116
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,500
Drinking is the
main problem.

117
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,542
And that's why they don't want
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

118
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,041
But they can give their
parents, but not Sahaja Yoga.

119
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,041
This is the trouble
with them.

120
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:48,125
Parents can be given up, in case they
do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

121
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,875
You should show
you don't like it.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,583
Why don't they
want Sahaja Yoga

123
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,375
Because they drink, Shri Mataji.
Ah? - Because they drink.

124
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,333
Now this is the curse of
Europe, that they all drink.

125
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:13,834
And drinking is something
very difficult.

126
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,375
They can't give it up, poor
things, they are slaves.

127
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,999
Slaves of drinking.

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,166
So by your behaviour, and
by your affection,

129
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,583
I'm sure you can
win them over.

130
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:34,125
What's the use - people who
drink die so early?

131
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,999
You must have heard that
they die very fast.

132
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,417
But despite that they don't realise
that one should not drink.

133
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:50,125
Because it has become an open
market now for people.

134
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,542
This is the biggest
problem of Europe.

135
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:59,041
But do you know it is
much worse in America.

136
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,125
America's problem
is so funny

137
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:12,583
that people who
do Sahaja Yoga

138
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,375
cannot convince
their parents.

139
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,959
And they think
they have freedom

140
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,542
to do whatever
they like.

141
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:30,333
And some of the Sahaja Yogis have lost
their parents at a very early age.

142
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,875
Very early age.

143
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:37,458
Also they have parents

144
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,583
who had heart...
heart attacks.

145
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,583
All kinds of attacks.

146
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:49,667
Not only heart but any
other disease they get.

147
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,250
It's very funny,

148
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,875
which they don't understand how
important it is to get realisation.

149
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,458
So you should try
to talk to them,

150
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,667
that "what is the aim
of your life."

151
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,375
You must ask them: "What
is the aim of your life?

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,583
You want to die or you
want to live?" - First question.

153
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,375
If they say they want
to die, let them die.

154
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:28,417
You should say: "Should we supply with
some wines for you when you die?"

155
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,208
Make fun of it.

156
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,542
Make a fun.

157
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,542
So they will realise  that they
are stupid, who are drinking,

158
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:43,000
and they are slaves.

159
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,834
Slaves of drinking.

160
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,125
They are not drinking because
they are free people.

161
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,125
Because they
drink, they die.

162
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,959
And die very fast.

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,834
The complication of the
societies is so much.

164
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:10,417
That I have seen people who were
rich, who had nice children,

165
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,542
but they have lost
their parenthood.

166
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:20,291
They have lost the children, and
they have no money also. They are on the street.

167
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:29,041
Drinking is the best way
to waste all your money.

168
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,000
They think then when
you say "don't drink",

169
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,959
you are interested in
their money, maybe.

170
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:44,125
God knows what they think because I don't
understand the psychology of people

171
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,250
who drink.

172
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,709
There are some
bhoots I think

173
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,583
who give them
ideas like this.

174
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,750
And they cannot
give up drinking.

175
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,999
Very wrong.

176
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,750
Where - in what book,

177
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:07,875
I mean like Bible or
any book is said,

178
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,583
that drinking is good?

179
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,750
Did Christ drink?

180
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:19,500
They will follow
Christianity.

181
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,208
they will follow
Christianity.

182
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,667
and not follow Christ.

183
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,500
It's like that.

184
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,417
Christ never drank. His
parents didn't drink.

185
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,667
Now what makes them think
that they have a right to drink?

186
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,166
Specially for Christians.

187
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,417
Stupid they are if they think
that drinking is their right.

188
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,000
And then they have
problems with drinking.

189
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,667
Perhaps you know what
problems there are.

190
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:06,667
You can find out what happens
when people are drunk.

191
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,667
What happens to them,
where do they go,

192
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,750
what is their position.

193
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,917
You can find out
their friends,

194
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:24,333
where are they, what they are
doing, how are they living.

195
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:31,125
You'll be amazed, that they are
already on their way out.

196
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:39,291
If you show your wisdom to
them, with assertion,

197
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,125
they will be
coming around.

198
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:49,000
You have to tell them.There's nothing
to feel shy about it.

199
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,750
You have to tell them what
happens with drinking.

200
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,041
What is so great
about it?

201
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,917
Europe problem
is drinking - first.

202
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:11,041
The second problem
is parenthood.

203
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,458
Parents don't understand the
responsibility of their children,

204
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,709
that all their lives they are going
to be children of yours.

205
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,125
And you have to
look after them.

206
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,542
There is no way
of getting it out.

207
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,000
First of all why should
you have children?

208
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:40,166
And if you have children, you have
to jolly well look after them.

209
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,041
But I have seen that in Europe
people are really stupid.

210
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,917
They don't understand
this simple fact,

211
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:55,750
that if we cannot look
after ourselves,

212
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,625
who will look after
our children?

213
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,458
Very irresponsible.

214
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,166
Also the society is such, that
in the society also,

215
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:14,250
they just believe in drinking.
All of them.

216
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,375
Indians who do
not drink in India,

217
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,333
- here they come
and drink.

218
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,041
When they come here

219
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,709
then they think it is something
ideal, and they drink.

220
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,375
I have known many like
that who came abroad

221
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,959
and started drinking.

222
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,917
So this is the big problem.

223
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:47,875
You should openly talk
about it, to everyone

224
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,834
That what is drinking
is stupidity

225
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:57,917
- to become stupid,
by paying for it.

226
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,500
Huh! You have to pay, and
you have to become mad.

227
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,333
Just imagine.

228
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:12,999
If you make fun of it, and if
you can tell them the truth

229
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,250
I am sure they are all with the
intelligence, they will understand.

230
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,291
But you should all
the time tell them.

231
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,667
The third problem is
that here it is

232
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:36,000
till you are an adult
you are away and free.

233
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,375
But I can't understand

234
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:44,792
- you are born
from your parents

235
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,166
and how do you become
free after eighteen years

236
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:52,208
or whatever age it is.

237
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,458
How can that be?

238
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,875
It's like a tree
producing fruits

239
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,375
and the people take away
their fruits and eat it.

240
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:09,542
We are not trees. We
are human beings

241
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,250
We can't behave like trees

242
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,999
which do not show
any interest

243
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,375
in their children
after

244
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,875
certain cutting
has happened.

245
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,375
But it's very
surprising.

246
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:34,500
See, for us Indians it's
absolutely surprising

247
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,041
that they can forget about
their own children?

248
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,500
How can
they do it?

249
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,709
You have got writers who
have written stories

250
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,875
and they have written
so many things here,

251
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,959
that how can parents
be stupid like that?

252
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,250
Whatever may be

253
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,041
- whatever may be
your father or mother

254
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,542
- they may be poor or
rich, whatever it is

255
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,458
- they are
your parents!

256
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,291
And parents are there
to look after you.

257
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:15,583
The stupid thing is that they make
the child look after themselves

258
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,458
When he is eighteen years
of old, he earns of his own

259
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,500
and the parents:
"Alright, go ahead."

260
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,542
They want to shirk all
the responsibility.

261
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,500
Never heard of
such a thing.

262
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,458
This is a very
recent fashion

263
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:45,250
When Abraham Lincoln was
there, did it happen like that?

264
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,291
Did it happen
with Christ

265
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:02,333
that Mother gave him up and said:"Alright,
go ahead and get yourself crucified!"

266
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,125
How can parents
behave like this?

267
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,000
They have no heart?

268
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,542
That they have no love
for their own children?

269
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,250
India may not
be that rich,

270
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:28,750
but people are loving
their children

271
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:39,291
Children also here do
not listen to their parents,

272
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,583
because parents don't
look after them.

273
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,709
Can you imagine
a society

274
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:51,166
religion, or whatever
you may call

275
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,834
-  people have no connection
with each other.

276
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,041
But in Sahaja Yoga we
are all connected.

277
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,583
We are all one.

278
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,959
And we want to
be together

279
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:13,667
with all our so-called
differences

280
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:16,792
We are Indians,

281
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,792
we are Africans,
we are English

282
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,375
but we are
all Sahaja Yogis.

283
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,375
And this is what you
have to tell them,

284
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,458
that what kind of
friends you have.

285
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:37,166
They just come here for
drinking and go away.

286
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,125
They'll not even
stand by you.

287
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:44,542
But our friends are
our dear friends.

288
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:52,417
Sahaja Yogis sometimes make
mistakes, doesn't matter.

289
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:58,542
But they are Sahaja Yogis, and they are
one and they help each other.

290
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,458
See how many countries have
come together in Sahaja Yoga,

291
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,125
and they have such
friendship with each other,

292
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,999
that you may not
have with the people

293
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,999
who are born on the
same side of the Earth.

294
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:21,834
You won't recognize
each other.It's horrible.

295
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:26,875
I tell you I am sometimes
surprised the way

296
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,333
parents don't think much
of their parents.

297
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:35,583
Parents do not think
that they are parents,

298
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,583
and the children
don't think

299
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,542
that we are children
of these parents.

300
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,208
I don't know what
has done that

301
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:53,166
It's the money as they say, it's
the money, money they earn.

302
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:58,166
Alright, so what do you do with
that money, make yourself miserable

303
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,291
and make everyone
miserable?

304
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,667
You don't even respect money,
because when you drink

305
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,041
how much money
you waste?

306
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:12,834
Does it go for
any help?

307
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:20,208
Then drinking, it's - here,
I was surprised

308
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:27,959
many have given up, luckily
have given up, and are happy.

309
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:32,750
It's one thing,
that in Europe

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,166
drinking is a big
social event

311
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:43,458
and everybody thinks they must
drink otherwise they are not human beings.

312
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:49,750
They have to become mad,
otherwise they are not.

313
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:56,542
Now the parents will understand
if you join together

314
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,709
You can bring them round, there are
people who have done like that.

315
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,250
All the Sahaja
Yogis together

316
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,834
have managed to bring the whole
Johnnies to Sahaja Yoga.

317
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,125
When they will see
that you are happy,

318
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:22,583
you don't tell lies, and you are
honest, and you are humble

319
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,792
- what more do
you want?

320
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,709
But they will
go to church,

321
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,959
call themselves Christians,
and behave like Satan.

322
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,917
See their behaviour.

323
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,500
They don't even care
for their children

324
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,834
because they have certain
habits they have developed.

325
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,166
"Why can't you give up
those bad habits?"

326
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:55,834
- this is the point you
should ask your parents.

327
00:26:56,542 --> 00:27:00,041
"Why don't you give
up this dirty stuff

328
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,917
which is just
making you mad?"

329
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,458
Drinking makes people
mad, I tell you,

330
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:13,542
and all their value
system is lost.

331
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,125
Whatever you
may be

332
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:20,166
whatever your
education,

333
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:24,959
all is useless if
you take to drinks.

334
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,208
You have no personality
after that.

335
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:36,667
Nothing [unclear] -
the way you behave,

336
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,291
and when people
get drunk,

337
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:44,375
do you see how they
behave in a funny manner

338
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,417
So just detest it

339
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,041
and tell your parents
you don't like drinking.

340
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:58,458
We don't want you to drink,
why do you drink?

341
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,792
You can tell them!
Why do you drink?

342
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,458
Because by drinking
they become mad...

343
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:16,750
it is better to get a certificate
from mad house.

344
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:26,500
You Sahaja Yogis now
realize this is madness

345
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,750
and you have
to tell them

346
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,834
that we think that you are all
mad who sit down and drink.

347
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,750
What do you want?

348
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,959
Drinking, what does
it give you?

349
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:53,834
First of all you must seek
peace of your mind.

350
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,709
That's not possible
if you drink,

351
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,417
have you heard of somebody who has
peace of mind because they drink?

352
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,667
When he dies,
maybe!

353
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:17,291
So it is to be told
to them frankly

354
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:23,458
why do you drink,what is the
need to waste all the money.

355
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:32,250
Mostly I have seen that they drink
because they are so ignorant,

356
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:38,333
that they don't know there is
a higher life and better life

357
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:43,709
by which you can control
your body, control everything.

358
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:50,291
Once they come to
know they will realize

359
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,458
that this drinking
makes you a slave

360
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,333
they are slaves
you see,

361
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:01,750
and when they tell you something you
should say: "we don't want to listen to slaves,

362
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,041
you are all slaves

363
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,333
- there's no harm in
telling like this.

364
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,000
"You are slaves and we don't
want to listen to slaves."

365
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,542
You see in India I don't know somehow
we have solved the problem,

366
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,667
people don't drink so much,

367
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:31,250
because from the very beginning there
the drinking is regarded as a very bad thing.

368
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,834
If a girl knows that the fellow
drinks she will never marry.

369
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:43,834
So society doesn't
accept drinking

370
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,500
is a good thing

371
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,125
while your  society
is no society

372
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,458
because there is no friendship

373
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,667
there is no understanding

374
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:03,834
and they don't think of
improving the life.

375
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,333
What do they think?
They are very selfish

376
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,041
and they think
of themselves

377
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,792
selfishness in the sense

378
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,542
that becoming mad is
very great selfishness.

379
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,709
They become mad,

380
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,917
and go on becoming more
mad and more mad

381
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,125
and it is a sickness,

382
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,792
you should tell them
that this is sickness.

383
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:42,208
"You are sick people already
and we don't want to follow you."

384
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,208
Don't be rude but you
should tell them.

385
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:51,917
Drinking is sickness,
you say I said it.

386
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,583
I don't mind.

387
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,250
Have you seen a man
who is drunk?

388
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,000
What do you
think of them?

389
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,041
They are more
than mad people.

390
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,125
People are mad because
something gone wrong.

391
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:22,000
But these are mad because
they have been drinking

392
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,542
so you have to tell them:
"You are all mad.

393
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,834
You are going to ruin your country."

394
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,959
So many things I have seen,
what happens in the West

395
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,125
my own experience.

396
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,250
See, I am working
in Maharastra,

397
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:47,917
working in India
in different places

398
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:53,125
but there is no
problem with them

399
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,542
when they are
realised souls

400
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:02,583
but here with realised souls
also I find problems.

401
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,750
There is no problem in India
if there is realised souls,

402
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,917
they are purely
realised

403
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,041
and here  there
are problems

404
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:21,250
even with the
realised people.

405
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,999
Here there are some
Sahaja Yogis

406
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
who made illegal money.

407
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:38,250
They are Sahaja Yogis, I know for
definite, but they have done like that

408
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,291
they have been saved,

409
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:49,792
but not in the Heaven.

410
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,834
They work it out,
save themselves

411
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,333
but everything happens.

412
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:06,500
Some people say: "Mother we
drink very little." But why?

413
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,208
Very common

414
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:15,709
very little we drink' but why?
Why do you want to drink

415
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:17,959
and waste your money,

416
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,000
first of all wasting
your money.

417
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,417
It's very sad

418
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:34,417
that all people who are
so well educated,

419
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:38,999
so well off, become
so mad

420
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,208
- I don't understand.

421
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,999
And if your parents are
drinking they are mad.

422
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:51,709
You have to treat
them like mad people.

423
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,375
Then they will
realize,

424
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,500
you should tell them off,

425
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:06,000
that you want to waste all
your money in drinking.

426
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:11,959
In India we have that way
very strong Sahaja Yogis.

427
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:17,917
They break the bottles, if
they come in the house.

428
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,917
or what they do

429
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:27,333
they break the...anything!

430
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,291
The parents become
really funny

431
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,709
because they can't understand what
is happening to these children.

432
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,667
But they are
Sahaja Yogis,

433
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,959
so they don't like it and
they just throw them out.

434
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,500
There is no humbleness

435
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:55,208
needed with
the mad people.

436
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:59,208
You have to see that they
give up their drinking,

437
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,917
very important,

438
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,709
and not to feel
shy about it.

439
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,875
If you correct
your parents

440
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:15,250
you correct the
whole nation.

441
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,250
So you all have
to work it out

442
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,333
and discuss among
yourselves

443
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,583
and tell:"Oh my
Father drinks a lot."

444
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,999
So you ask your friend
to come and put him right.

445
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,583
You can make fun
of them, they are mad!

446
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:45,458
Do not take  them seriously,they
are mad, have pity on them,

447
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,291
and work it
out that way.

448
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,208
You have so many
friends together.

449
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,875
Drinking is the
curse in the West,

450
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:02,750
and how it has come - I think some
satanic force has worked,

451
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,250
they never used to
drink so much before.

452
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,834
No!

453
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,000
Now I don't know,

454
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,667
you walk on the street and
you find so many of them

455
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,583
walking along.

456
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,458
So Sahaja Yogis should see that
they don't drink themselves

457
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:32,583
and don't allow
anybody to drink,

458
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,166
your father, mother,
brother

459
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,500
you have to tell them:
"You are all mad!

460
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:45,250
Go to some
mad house!"

461
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:49,750
Once you tell them
they will realize,

462
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,959
it's only you who
can correct them.

463
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,917
I may do anything

464
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:02,125
but first of all these people
should give up drinking?!

465
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,709
You have lot of strength
as Sahaja Yogis

466
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:11,041
and you have to work
out on your parents.

467
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,166
How many of your parents
are drinking? Raise your hands.

468
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,834
Your parents also?

469
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,834
Bah prai!

470
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,458
Just imagine.

471
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:41,458
You should all oppose
their drinking, openly.

472
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,583
You should say I don't like to
talk to people who drink. Like that.

473
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,792
You go on and you'll be
surprised they'll come round.

474
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:05,792
It is absolutely
depending on you.

475
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:12,709
If your parents are drinking you
have to take a very strong view.

476
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,375
And you have so many other
friends, also, to help you.

477
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,500
Make fun of them.

478
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,709
Somebody should
copy

479
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:28,917
as to how they behave after
drinking, how they walk.

480
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,583
You should not insult
them but to copy them.

481
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,917
Once they will know
there is no respect

482
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:44,333
and care for the parents
they'll be alright.

483
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,166
But even if they drink

484
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:55,125
you are not so
much bothered

485
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,917
you are not bothered as
to - if they are drinking,

486
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:05,208
but you should say that youare all
mad, where will you be going?

487
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,625
What will happen
to you?

488
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,709
You can talk like elderly
people with them

489
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,542
and also see that they don't
have friends who drink

490
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:30,458
if they have friends like that
you'd better tell the friends.

491
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,625
You see

492
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:44,834
it's not only you get responsibility
when you get your realization

493
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,667
but it is your
absolute responsibility

494
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,542
that

495
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:56,291
you improve your parents and
improve your brothers and sisters,

496
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,959
you have to boss
over them

497
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:12,375
and you have to tell
them, nothing to feel shy.

498
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,458
Because they are
mad, you know!

499
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:27,417
Very important for
Sahaja Yogis.

500
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,458
My experience
is this,

501
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:36,333
that there are
Sahaja Yogis

502
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:39,709
in the West who
are born,

503
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,125
who get realization,

504
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:47,500
who are very good, who are excellent,
I don't have to say anything.

505
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:53,000
But they are humble
before their parents.

506
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,709
You try to show that
you don't like it.

507
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,291
If they are drinking
don't sit there

508
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,709
get out of
that place.

509
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:10,166
You should try to denounce
the whole thing.

510
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,500
There's no harm.

511
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,750
If somebody says harsh
words you fight it back.

512
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:27,417
But what about all these drunkards
who are sitting and drinking?

513
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:30,000
You have to
tell them all.

514
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,625
It's only you who can
improve your society.

515
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:40,792
I'm here to
tell you,

516
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,917
but you people
are very subdued.

517
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:58,999
How many of you fight with the
parents, tell me, raise your hands.

518
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,834
Hardly any.

519
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,250
You are afraid of them,
these drunkards?

520
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,542
They should be
afraid of you

521
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,458
and hide themselves
somewhere

522
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:35,166
If there are bottles in the
house you break them.

523
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,583
Of course!

524
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,417
You throw them
away,break them

525
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,458
That's how you
have to fight them.

526
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,792
How did we manage the British
to go away from India?

527
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,667
By protesting!

528
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,667
By protesting

529
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:13,250
their domination,
that's all! Simple!

530
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,792
And they
went away.

531
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,041
Can you imagine, there
was no war, nothing,

532
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,500
and they all left us.

533
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Because they say it is
cold that's why they drink.

534
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:40,417
No need, there is no
need to drink for that.

535
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:47,917
I know so many Indians,
so many of them,

536
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,458
they don't drink

537
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,000
they have never seen
such a cold country.

538
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,583
Now also many Russians
they don't drink.

539
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:04,959
Very cold country,
Russians.

540
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,583
And they don't allow their parents
also to drink, you know, Russians.

541
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,667
They are very brave,
the way they fought.

542
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:19,000
You know how Hitler was
trying to dominate them,

543
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,333
but they got
all the power.

544
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:25,792
So the Russians are
not so, I should say,

545
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:28,500
So the Russians are
not so, I should say,

546
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,542
fashionable.

547
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,041
You are Russian, na?

548
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,542
That I can...
- Ukraine leader.

549
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,792
Agree.

550
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:46,208
Russians are very
very brave people.

551
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:51,291
And they have fought
their parents.

552
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,041
And now in Russia we have
such a lot of Sahaja Yogis.

553
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:01,166
It will happen that
Russia will become whole

554
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:06,000
realised soul.

555
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:11,250
While here the great people who
think no end of themselves

556
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:16,208
will be all ending up
in the lunatic asylum.

557
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,291
So today's My
lecture remember

558
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:29,166
that you have every right
to oppose your parents

559
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,375
if they are drinking.

560
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,959
What they think that you want
all the money, that's why.

561
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:43,166
But you should say:
"We don't want your money".

562
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:50,792
So now if you
are a leader,

563
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,333
and there are who
are leading,

564
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:58,417
you should remember if you
are opposing your parents.

565
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:00,792
What do you care?

566
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:07,709
Russians are very
brave, I must say.

567
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:11,583
They have told
their parents off

568
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,750
Even authorities.

569
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:21,750
Why? Because they
are communists? Is it that?

570
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,750
Because they are
free-minded people.

571
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:31,208
After all you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

572
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:36,250
and what right they have
got to dominate you.

573
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:43,959
They have no right,
they are drunkards

574
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,875
how can they dominate you?

575
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:50,291
You tell them ,you are
drunkards, don't talk!

576
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,208
No harm.

577
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:02,750
You have to fight, you have to fight
your parents, very important.

578
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,583
I'm with you.

579
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,792
May God bless you.

580
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:26,041
They will fight for democracy,
this, that. It's all demonocracy,

581
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,792
What is their democracy?

582
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:34,291
When they drink what business
they have got to dominate you?

583
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:39,125
Who are they? Drunkards,

584
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,542
put them down!

585
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,333
You have to now fight.

586
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:49,625
The time has come, too
much time you have spent

587
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:52,291
and tolerated them.

588
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,583
What have
they done?

589
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,250
Nothing.

590
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:05,291
I must say Russians
are very clever,

591
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:09,291
and very brave.

592
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,417
Yes!

593
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,959
You know how they
made Hitler run away.

594
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,834
Man like Hitler ran
away from there.

595
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,959
How did they
manage?

596
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:28,333
Because basically
they are honest

597
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,333
and brave

598
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:38,500
So we do not drink so why
should we be cowards?

599
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:42,834
Only the drunkards
can be cowards.

600
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,417
You are not drunkards,

601
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,959
so you should be
brave and tell

602
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:52,792
your parents and improve
your family life.

603
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:57,125
Here I find the family

604
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,667
life is so horrible.

605
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:05,125
Parents are funny,
mothers are funny,

606
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:10,583
how can they be? How can
you be their children?

607
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,917
You should say that we are ashamed
to be the children of drunkards.

608
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,125
They will realize.

609
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:33,542
Russians have
given up drinking.

610
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,500
Those who are
Sahaja Yogis,

611
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:41,250
they have given
up completely.

612
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:53,500
I don't know what has
made them like that.

613
00:50:56,041 --> 00:51:00,709
They are neither interested in
money or position or anything.

614
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,375
Sahaja Yogis.

615
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:16,542
The Indians have
got a heritage

616
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,417
but they also,they come to
England they start drinking.

617
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:31,375
They think people don't drink
because they are not free.

618
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,291
What is the idea?

619
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,333
If you are free you
should be able to drink,

620
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,000
you should
become mad?

621
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:44,458
That's freedom,
isn't it?

622
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,625
Now you can tell
them: "You are mad!"

623
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,333
You are drinking so
you are mad.

624
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,750
Tell them I have
said it.

625
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,417
Alright now are
you convinced?

626
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:17,834
Now...

627
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:29,583
Everybody's getting
vibrations?

628
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,333
Is there somebody who is not
getting? Please raise your hand.

629
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,750
See

630
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:45,583
How collective you are
and how powerful.

631
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:52,875
But I have seen that Sahaja Yogis
are so afraid of their parents.

632
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:57,166
That they group together
like two cowards.

633
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,834
You should be brave

634
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:06,000
and tell them off, you have
got the power to do that

635
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,291
If you can

636
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:14,291
change your parents you have
done a big job to them.

637
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,417
What else can you
do for them?

638
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:24,542
If the parents are changed
you have done a big job.

639
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,875
What do you say?

640
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,542
You are too mild.

641
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:38,709
You take two, three Sahaja
Yogis and beat them nicely.

642
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,041
Otherwise they beat in
any case after drinking.

643
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,500
With drinking
they do!

644
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,125
It's very sad.

645
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:05,417
You all are free
country people,

646
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,417
but you have
to fight, without

647
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:14,041
the fight it won't
work out.

648
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,417
So I want you all
to meet each other,

649
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:22,208
and have complete
sense,

650
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:26,041
that you are
Sahaja Yogis.

651
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,500
that means you are
being blessed by God.

652
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:34,917
And you are
representative of God.

653
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:40,333
And you are not going to
take to these dirty things.

654
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,250
Respect yourselves,

655
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,375
respect!

656
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:55,166
You can tell your parents we
cannot respect you for drink.

657
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,625
Tell them.

658
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:01,208
You can tell them
I have said so.

659
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:09,291
Look at Christ how
he fought.

660
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:15,709
What sort of
Christians they are...

661
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,458
Drinking, drinking, drinking.

662
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,333
But in India - why don't they
drink? They don't drink.

663
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,542
They just live without
drinking, they are doing well.

664
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:54,333
I think you take
from Me that courage

665
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:57,417
to fight your parents.

666
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:02,417
Next time when
I come,

667
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,500
I don't want to see
anybody saying

668
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:08,709
that the parents
don't listen.

669
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:27,875
When they are drunk you can
hit them with the spoon.

670
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:41,999
Even in Russia they
drink quite a lot,

671
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,792
but those who have got
realisation don't drink.

672
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:49,500
At any reason.
They don't drink.

673
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:53,542
That's why I think
communism is good.

674
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:56,583
Because they have
so much courage!

675
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,542
With all this democracy

676
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:06,709
you are all becoming demons,
nothing but demons.

677
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:12,792
So today I take
your promise,

678
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,333
that you will manage
your parents well.

679
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:25,750
Thank you very much.

680
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:32,500
Anybody has any
problems, you tell me.

681
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:38,166
Mother, in my school
there are many students

682
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,333
whose family, they drink
and they're all split up.

683
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,333
They are very
disturbed.

684
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,291
I can't hear him.

685
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,709
He says that in his school
many friends, familly drink,

686
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:53,041
and the parents split, divorced.
Because of drinking.

687
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:58,750
When? When they
have time free?

688
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:05,500
And they're all disturbed, the
students are all disturbed, Mother.

689
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,250
They want what?

690
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:13,458
The students - their parents
drink and separate.

691
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:15,667
There are lots
of problems,

692
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,417
and the young students
are very upset about it.

693
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:20,000
You break
their bottles.

694
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:25,667
You tell them
I have told you.

695
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:30,834
You break their bottles, you
see the bottle and break it.

696
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,333
Then you see.

697
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,417
We have done
that in India,

698
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:40,750
you know when we were
asking for independence?

699
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:47,375
The children, they used
to break their bottles.

700
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,667
With the bottles in, you can
never enjoy your freedom.

701
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,999
You break it!

702
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:11,500
Any question?

703
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:23,792
We shouldn't insult them but you
can break the bottles alright.

704
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:33,875
Shri Mataji thank you, that you come
to Burwood , thank you.

705
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,583
May God bless you.
