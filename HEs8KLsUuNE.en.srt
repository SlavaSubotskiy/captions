1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,200
… by the Divine.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,000
For example, if I know only my head,
that is not sufficient.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,680
If I know only my neck,
that is not sufficient.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,640
If I know only my legs,
that is not sufficient.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,120
But the more I know about myself,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,200
the more dynamic I become,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,600
the more expansive I become.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:40,040
And all the great that existed —

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,760
or all the people
who were called as great —

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,280
are great because they lived
in many human beings.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,880
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere,

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,760
as you are feeling because you know
they are not foreigners,

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,560
they are your brothers and sisters.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,120
There are so many stories
in Puranas like this, that…

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,320
I will not name it, but once
two brothers met in a jungle.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,240
But they thought that they were enemies,

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,600
and they wanted to fight with each other.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,520
And when they came to blows,
they couldn’t hit each other.

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
Then they took out their arrows —
the arrows wouldn’t work.

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,000
They were quite surprised at this,

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
and when they asked each other,
“Who is your mother?”,

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,280
they found out mother was the same.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,720
And then they realized that they were
not foreigners neither enemies

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,640
but they were made of the same fibre.

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,720
What sweetness, what beauty
that knowledge has given them!

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,280
And what security of understanding

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
that everywhere in the whole world
we have brothers and sisters,

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,000
who are on their inner being,
on their divine,

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,320
and how we are bound together
with that love!

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,560
When I talk of love,

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
people think that I am trying
to make you weak people —

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,200
because people think
those who love are weak.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,320
But the most dynamic power
in this world is that of love.

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Is the most aggressive power —
is that of love.

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
Even we, when we suffer in love,

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,480
it is out of our strength that we suffer
and not out of our weakness.

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,680
For example,
there was a teacher in China

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,720
who used to teach the cocks
how to fight.

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,000
And the king of that place
took his cocks to that teacher

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,880
and told him that
“You please teach them how to fight.”

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,360
After one month, when the king
went to take those cocks with him,

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,120
he was surprised that the cocks
were just silent, doing nothing.

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,240
And he told the teacher that
“What have you done to my cocks?

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,040
They are not at all aggressive,
they are not doing anything!

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,280
How are they going to fight it out?

46
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,280
There’s going to be a race,

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,360
there’s going to be an exhibition
of their strength,

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
and what are we going to do about it?”

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,360
He said, “You just take them.”

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,360
He took those two cocks with him
and put them in the arena

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,160
where there were other cocks
who had come to fight.

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,760
These two cocks
were very nicely standing.

53
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,520
All the other cocks
started coaxing and torturing.

54
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,440
They were just standing
and looking at them.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,800
All the other cocks were surprised
at their behaviour

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
and thought that they were very powerful.

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
And they all fled away.

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,400
The love that I’m talking about,
the divine love,

59
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,760
makes you not only strong but dynamic.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It is the greatest luminous power
that we can think of.

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,680
Only when love is surrounded by gross
and is lost in the gross,

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,720
it looks as if it is weak
and “under chains”.

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,920
The time it is released,
the dynamic power of love

64
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,120
can transcend
all the evil powers of the world.

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,480
When people get their Realization,

66
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,680
automatically the ego drops out —
to a great extent, I should say.

67
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,160
Because you say
that the vibrations are passing;

68
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,800
you don’t say that you are giving them.

69
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Because the dropping of the ego

70
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,600
sometimes it happens that you feel

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,600
that whatever you wanted to have
you have got it

72
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,080
and you better not talk about it.

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
When there is any opposition
from anywhere,

74
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,240
you shun it and sit away from it.

75
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
You don’t want to face the opposition —
of any negative opposition,

76
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,440
whether it is by speech
or by… even by evil methods.

77
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,040
We run away from that, thinking,
“Oh God! How are we going to face it?”

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,560
On the contrary, a person
who is negative, who has got hatred,

79
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,760
becomes… [Marathi word?] they call it,
means a person who talks big.

80
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,960
Such a person talks… starts talking big.

81
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,800
He thinks he is above everybody else,
he can befool all the world.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,720
He takes a responsibility on himself.

83
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,920
He starts a big ashram or some big place
where he sits down with all his ignorance

84
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,880
and starts spreading his knowledge —
the so-called — to people.

85
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,200
By his methods people get impressed,
and they all go and fall at his feet.

86
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,600
While the realized sits at home quietly,

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,520
wondering what are these fools doing.

88
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,680
But it is not now
for the realized to sit down

89
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,760
and to wonder and laugh
at the foolishness of the people

90
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,480
who are not yet realized.

91
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,840
Not even to take pity on them
but to come out,

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
come out with the sword of love
to win the whole world.

93
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,120
It is very, very essential.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,360
If the creation has to be saved,

95
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,840
then you are not to keep mum about it.

96
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,760
All the wrong ideas about love,

97
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,800
all the falsehood about love
has to be given up.

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,880
One must know
that it is the dynamic power.

99
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,600
And it won’t allow you
to sit comfortably with yourself,

100
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
enjoying the peace and the bliss,

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,040
when the rest of the world
is not enjoying that

102
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,200
and is playing into the hands
of the evil geniuses

103
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,560
who have come in this world to destroy

104
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:40,240
and to bring the satanic realm

105
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,200
on this earth.

106
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Now the days are gone
when the people had to suffer.

107
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
Christ suffered for us.

108
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,760
Of course, Christ never suffered,
because He never suffered.

109
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
He never wept.

110
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,440
He was like those cocks,
a very powerful personality.

111
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,800
But today is the day

112
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,360
to brighten up your understanding

113
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,920
about your own strength
that is within you.

114
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Those who are gross
should worry about their insecurities,

115
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,760
and their problems,
and their organizations —

116
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,040
but not for the people who are realized.

117
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,320
I have told you many a times —
and today he also remarked —

118
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,080
that you should know you are never alone
when you are realized.

119
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,920
There have been many people
who have been realized,

120
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,640
before even you were born,

121
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,800
who exist,

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,200
who are anxious to help you
at every moment.

123
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,400
In our shastras [scriptures] we call them
chiranjivas [eternal beings], you know them.

124
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,640
They are people who are niranjanas
[pure, free from falsehood].

125
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,840
As he said about Bhairava and Hanumana,
all these people exist,

126
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,280
and they are waiting
just for a call from you.

127
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,880
Once we went to the market,

128
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,280
and there was a problem

129
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
about something.

130
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,360
And I had somebody with Me, a disciple…
who was also with Me.

131
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,680
I just wanted to see
what will be his reaction.

132
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,960
He tried to argue out with a person
to tell him about something.

133
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,080
So he told Me, “Mataji, let us go now.”

134
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,360
When we came out the shop, I said,
“What are you going to do about it?”

135
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,520
He said, “I have already told Hanuman
to look after that part.”

136
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
And the work was done.

137
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,520
It is gross, but it happens.

138
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,240
When they fail
[Shri Mataji could mean “you fail”],

139
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,080
you can leave it to anyone of them,
and they will have to jolly well do it.

140
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,000
Because it is you who are on the stage
and not they.

141
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,360
They are the background people.

142
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,600
They are the playbacks.

143
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,760
But you must open your mouth;
otherwise, if they start thinking,

144
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
what will people say?

145
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,720
They are going to help you in every way,

146
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,520
but how far are you standing
on your security?

147
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,720
How far you are standing on your property,
on your understanding of yourself?

148
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,000
It’s a great war going on.

149
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,920
You are not aware of it?

150
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Some of you are.

151
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,880
Some of you are definitely aware of it

152
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,200
because they have had the experience
of fighting it out.

153
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,640
It’s a big war on.

154
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Now specially, when ten rakshasas [demons]
have taken their avataras [incarnations].

155
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,920
And for you to be so feeble…

156
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,840
You are still small children, no doubt,

157
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,360
because you got your Realization
only a few days back.

158
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,800
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

159
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,560
You can grow into big, big giants.

160
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,320
All of you can grow.

161
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,280
Only thing, you have to decide
that you have to grow within.

162
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,200
There are so many things

163
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,000
that you only have discovered,
by which a person grows.

164
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I can give you food,

165
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,520
but you have to grow yourself.

166
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Wherever you see the negativity,
you have to stand up and say,

167
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,760
“This is negativity and nothing else,
whether you like it or not.”

168
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,880
In that, you love that person,
you don’t hate.

169
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,600
Only talking sweetly
is not the idea of love.

170
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,640
No, a mother sometimes
even scolds the child.

171
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,160
Doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love him.

172
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,240
If it is necessary, you have to tell
the person that it is negativity.

173
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Of course, if there’s a realized person,
he won’t mind any correction,

174
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,120
because he wants the correction,
he knows that it has to be corrected.

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
The instrument has to be corrected.

176
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,600
But a person who doesn’t understand,

177
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,760
you have to force your love
on that person.

178
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,160
You can force that love,
you know that — sitting down here.

179
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,200
Many people have tried putting love
around certain people

180
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
who were trying to be mischievous —

181
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,560
and they have been able to achieve
great results.

182
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,080
Those people have turned back
and come back.

183
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,920
Only by putting your hand
and putting your attention on that person

184
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,760
and moving this hand like this,

185
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,400
the love encircles,
and the person comes back.

186
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,520
There is no doubt
that there is negativity and positivity,

187
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,560
nothing in between these,
you must remember.

188
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,920
There is no compromise between the two.

189
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,920
Either it is light and darkness,

190
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,280
or it is positive and negative —

191
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,480
definitely there are two things
that are fighting.

192
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,840
Only thing, your will —
that’s the trouble with the whole joke.

193
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,320
That your will is respected,
your will is throughout respected.

194
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,680
If you have the will
to be a giant that loves, you can be.

195
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,760
The other day I met a psychiatrist,

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
and he was catching
his superego very much.

197
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,640
I said, “What’s wrong with you?”

198
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,200
He said, “My childhood.
My childhood, I couldn’t get much love.”

199
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,040
I said, “Now I am there.
You come in My lap. Take the love.”

200
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,840
He said, “I want to flow my love, Mother.

201
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,160
I want to open out myself,
completely, without any fear.”

202
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,320
I said, “You just start it.

203
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
Don’t worry what people
are going to misunderstand,

204
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,320
what people are going to say.

205
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,920
It’s nothing important
what people are going to say or anything.

206
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,760
For love, the satisfaction is only love,
that you love another person.”

207
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
“You just flow your love,” I said,
“and you will feel it will work out.

208
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,280
Just decide that ‘I am going
to love people.’

209
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And once you decide that,
the whole heaven,

210
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,400
the whole power of the heaven
will fall at your feet.

211
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
You believe Me in this.”

212
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,920
If you see otherwise,
I am an ordinary housewife.

213
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Some people always say,
“Mataji, how can be like this?”

214
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,520
Why not? I am just like you.

215
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,960
I have the same problems as you have.

216
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,960
But only thing I know,

217
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,440
that I am nothing but embodiment
of that love that is divine,

218
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,840
and I can’t exist without it.

219
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Every moment of My life
let the love flow, let the love flow.

220
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,720
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

221
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,120
And that makes you completely powerful.

222
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,160
If you read…
I was reading Devi Mahatmyam that…

223
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,560
they talk about a rakshasa

224
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,760
who faced Primordial Mother,
the Divine Mother,

225
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,200
and he laughed at Her: “You woman!
What can you do to me, you are a woman!

226
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,840
What can you do to me?”

227
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,040
And She smiled at him and said,
“All right, come along, let us see.”

228
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,440
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

229
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,080
Very clearly that shows

230
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,640
that positivity can cut
the throat of negativity.

231
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
There is no himsa [violence] in that.

232
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,160
You must remember the difference
between the two.

233
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,600
If negativity is cut
and positive brought out,

234
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,600
that is the greatest ahimsa [non-violence]
you can do to someone.

235
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,560
You have seen what negativity does to people;
you have now known what is negativity.

236
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,240
You have seen how people suffer
with spirits on them.

237
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,040
And here, they are also anxious
to be loved your way,

238
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,480
you’ll be surprised to know that —
if you really love them.

239
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,680
They themselves come to Me
and say, “Give me salvation, Mother.”

240
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,480
They come to Me only for that —
sometimes with you —

241
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,600
that I should give them salvation.

242
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,320
And if I promise that,
they take the birth again.

243
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,240
But there are rakshasas,
there are rakshasas.

244
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,960
As I told you the other day,
the Kali Yuga has laid a beautiful stage,

245
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,280
and a very wonderful drama
is to be played —

246
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,680
in which the Ravana
has to love Sita as a mother,

247
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,240
the Kansa has to fall
at the feet of Radha.

248
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Perhaps, you do not know
that Krishna wanted to kill Kansa.

249
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,800
At that time, he was His uncle.

250
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,320
So, you see, the feeling came in Him,
of His mother,

251
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,560
that “After all, he is my brother.”
[Shri Mataji could mean “her brother”]

252
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,960
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him —

253
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,840
the Radha, who loved
the whole world at that time.

254
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,760
She is the embodiment of love,
and She killed Kansa —

255
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,080
because it was to be.

256
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,400
When you are playing
in the hands of God,

257
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,600
then, if He wants to kill some body,
it has to be slain.

258
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,840
But first of all you have to be
in the hands of God completely.

259
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,040
It is His love only
which kills this body.

260
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:48,680
And when the songs
of their strength and victory is sung —

261
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,800
you have seen it, all My chakras,
how they start working and vibrating.

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,440
Because the strength
of those victorious days

263
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,800
is still lingering on,
and it is going to work through you. 

264
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,720
But what about your poor instrument,

265
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,920
which is moving little slowly?

266
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,760
The time when love has to rule,
the Satya Yuga,

267
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:38,320
if it has to come, it is going to be
through your efforts, now.

268
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts.
But now, all your efforts are divine.

269
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,560
Whatever you do,
whatever sympathetic you activate,

270
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,080
you are getting it through parasympathetic —
you don’t do anything at all.

271
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,680
But you can see yourself
what stakes are involved.

272
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,200
You are the chosen ones,
otherwise why is it

273
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,280
that you are the only people
who got this Realization

274
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,920
and so much you have come forward?

275
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,480
Some of you got it only few days back
and have gone very far. Why?

276
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,160
You are the chosen ones,
and you have to take it upon yourself

277
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,680
to be the channels of that divine love,
that dynamic power,

278
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,280
which is going to transform
the whole conception of hatred

279
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,080
on which all these nations
and all these differences are created.

280
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,120
It looks sometimes: how? how can it be?

281
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,200
But now the days are gone, of Gokul
[city of Shri Krishna’s childhood].

282
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
I was thinking of it.

283
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,800
Of the time when Krishna
used to play His flute

284
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,400
and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the gopis
and the gopas [cowherd girls and boys].

285
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
Oh, we tried and tried and tried,
in different lives!

286
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,120
Nothing worked.

287
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,320
And now it is going to click
like a spark.

288
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,880
The chain reaction will start.

289
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,480
But we have to have
strong machines to carry that.

290
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,240
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

291
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Only the strength that is in you
is to be felt by your attention.

292
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,200
That’s the only thing you have to do —
is to feel your attention

293
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
and give up all that is falsehood.

294
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,720
All that is falsehood
you see within yourself,

295
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,080
and you will know what is falsehood
and just drop it.

296
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,360
Accept only the truth,
and the truth will give you that power

297
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,760
to be the real instrument,

298
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
to carry this channel,

299
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,280
that force of love.

300
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,800
It should not mean
that you have to be egoistic —

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,520
you cannot be even if you try to.

302
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,400
You cannot harm anyone
even if you want to trouble.

303
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
So many of you have expressed

304
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,600
that “Mataji, You are giving it
to every Dick, Tom and Harry.”

305
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,280
I can’t give it to Dick, Tom and Harry —

306
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,880
it has to be a man
who has been searching,

307
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,960
it has to be a woman who has been searching
in their previous lives.

308
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,560
You should know that whatever you have got it,
you have got it in your own right.

309
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,200
So, a person may look
like a Dick, Tom, Harry,

310
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
but he is not, he’s a great saint.

311
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,040
They are all saints sitting here.

312
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
It’s a centre and nucleus of saintliness

313
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,480
where the complete Divine is flowing.

314
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,720
Only thing is, let it flow out from you.

315
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,120
This power is that of God,

316
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,800
and it is not your responsibility

317
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,320
to worry as to whether it will do
good or bad.

318
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,920
Even if you think
that it may do some bad things

319
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,160
according to the moral sciences
of this world,

320
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,280
ultimately it is going to be all right.

321
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,560
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed?
Why that Kansa was to be killed?

322
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,000
Why Ravana was to be killed?

323
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,040
Of course, killing doesn’t help much —
that I have realized.

324
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,160
Because all those who were killed
are back again in their saddles.

325
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,400
But still, you don’t fight

326
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,240
those horrible people.

327
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,240
You just fight yourself out.

328
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,680
You just watch yourself.

329
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,440
Where are you? What are you doing?

330
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,720
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

331
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,840
Just think about it every moment,

332
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,720
every moment you are in meditation.

333
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,280
Just think of the moment
and the dynamism of that moment.

334
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,080
The complete power that is filling
every moment just to go inside you.

335
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,120
It will flow through your Sahastrara
inside your being,

336
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,760
and completely revolve
around your whole being,

337
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,440
and transform the inside
into a complete Chaitanya Shakti,

338
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,800
a complete Divine Power.

339
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,280
Allow it to come in, accept it.

340
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,640
Accept it without any fear.

341
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Let it get in.

342
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,520
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

343
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,480
It’s a very precarious time
that we are up to.

344
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,880
I have only two hands,
you can see that very clearly.

345
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,680
And though Mr. ___ says
that I can do everything,

346
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,880
I can do everything
but not to make you do something.

347
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,880
Your will will be respected throughout.

348
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,360
Every other thing can be looked after

349
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,560
except for one —
that you should be a perfect machine,

350
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,160
a perfect channel, a perfect flute

351
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,720
for My Lord to play that tune of love.

352
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,920
It is for you to clear out
all your seven holes.

353
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,080
It is for you to clear out
your hollowness

354
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,960
and to be complete within yourself —
and He knows His job.

355
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,160
He is the artist.

356
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,080
But you are the instruments.

357
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,160
And the harmonious music
from so many souls

358
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,440
can fill the ears of these evil people

359
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,440
and can penetrate into their heart
and put love into them,

360
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,520
and may be that they themselves
will give up their evil ways

361
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,680
and fall at the feet of love.

362
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Krishna is to be born within you today.

363
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,040
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kaliya
[monstrous serpent who lived in river Yamuna].

364
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,480
That Krishna is to be born within you.

365
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,280
Went and sat on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara

366
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,360
and was pressing with His feet,

367
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,560
and all the people were seeing
this great drama

368
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,520
of Krishna’s dancing
on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara.

369
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,600
Krishna is to be born within your being.

370
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,520
When you are Krishna,
you are not going to see Him.

371
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,080
Let us now go to the state

372
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,160
which is beyond words,

373
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
beyond thoughts,

374
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,880
into the realm of thoughtless awareness,

375
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,440
where the Divine
is pouring its blessings.

376
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,920
These people have decided today
to have a puja,

377
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,680
and you know what happens to Me
when you do My puja.

378
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,560
So, with all those problems
that we’ll be facing later,

379
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,520
I would like all of you
to be attentive about the puja

380
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,080
and to take full advantage of that.

381
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,240
With this puja you get
the Mother’s protection,to begin with.

382
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,520
And My chakras, when they start moving,

383
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,280
they give you special powers of love,

384
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,400
and bless all your chakras,
and fill them up completely.

385
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
So I would like you —

386
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,720
though some two people
are coming to do this —

387
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,880
all of you to feel
that you all are doing it —

388
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,640
and you can feel it that way
with oneness.

389
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,040
And the blessings of My being
will flow to you automatically.
