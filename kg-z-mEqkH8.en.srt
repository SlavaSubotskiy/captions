1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:27,600
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,080
that is your Mother.

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,260
And as I told you, it’s a very unique happening

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,700
that Mother, Herself, has to become your Guru.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,000
And also you know that it is a very difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Because her love is so overflowing

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,720
that it is difficult for Her to give any discipline to Her children.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,520
She can not discipline Her own Love.

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,340
How can She discipline Her children?

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Being that, the responsibility on the disciples is much more.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,000
If the Guru is the person who can discipline you

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,720
without feeling anything

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,180
hurting to him,

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,540
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

15
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:51,720
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very difficult,

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:04,380
I would say, a very difficult job to be the guru.

17
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,860
She does not know how to balance,

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,740
And She is extremely forgiving because She is the Mother.

19
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,560
While the guru, from the very beginning, does not forgive.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,500
But mother, till the end, she’ll go to the last end.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,740
Even if the child has forsaken her,

22
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,740
even if he has beaten her up,

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,260
even if he is willing to kill Her,

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,360
still She will be saying that, "My child are you hurt?"

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,780
Then the responsibility of the disciples is much more, to see

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,420
that they do not hurt Her,

27
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,200
and they do not hurt Her, and they do not take My love for granted.

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,460
For they must know that they have to prove themselves

29
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,360
and they have to improve themselves.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,240
That is why this day it is a very unique combination

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,620
of tremendous Love

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
overflowing you,

33
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,120
and also the thought,

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,160
I would say, the divine inspiration,

35
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,840
that tells me that you have to be disciplined.

36
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,780
You have to be disciplined sahaja,

37
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,400
not by another person.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,620
But has to be,

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,960
because if the ship is not properly tied up

40
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
and it is not seaworthy

41
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,420
it cannot go very far.

42
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,680
If you want to enjoy

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:59,560
the ride in the ocean of His grace and compassion,

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,800
His bliss and kindness,

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,980
then you must build up yourself fully.

46
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,000
Now we have seen we have chakras,

47
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:20,740
and we can excite them, we can awaken them by awakening the Deities.

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,420
But is it not a mechanical process.

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,920
Every Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

50
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,980
which is a very subtle being within you.

51
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,800
You know them, one by one.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,260
And you know why these chakras are catching — because you lack that part.

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,760
There is nothing to feel bad about it.

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,160
As I told you this is like your motor car outside.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,320
This is your instrument. But the instrument has to be properly harmonised and cleaned.

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,780
Today I want certain promises by you to be reached.

57
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,540
And the foremost of all,

58
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,520
as Christ has said,

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,220
"Love thy neighbour as thyself".

60
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,380
I would say, one step ahead of that:

61
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,300
"Love thy neighbour, a sahaja yogi, more that yourself."

62
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,480
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do for the whole universe: among yourselves.

63
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,460
First of all decide: what have you done for others?

64
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:47,160
Second: A promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other sahaj yogi,

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,080
even if he beats you hollow!

66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,400
You can tell for that:

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,540
that is the greatest sin you will be committing from sins.

68
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,180
Don't try to correct others!

69
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,160
If he asks you to check things then tell that sweetly.

70
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,700
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for saying something sweet.

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,060
I am telling you again and again and again.

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,380
Otherwise I will put some sort of a restriction on you.

73
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,100
Try to control your tongue.

74
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,400
It’s very essential to put sweetly something, you can,

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
you are sahaja yogis,

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,820
it’s very easy to put it sweetly [something].

77
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,340
It’s such an attractive thing.

78
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,880
Why do you say harsh things?

79
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,280
For what? To create enemy?

80
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,780
If you want to have enemies, you can have so many:

81
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,920
for that you need not say harsh things.

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Very easy to gather enemies. It is difficult to get friends.

83
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,800
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

84
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,120
The Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,980
And that hurts Me the most.

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,300
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

87
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,780
will take out my heart into many parts.

88
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,860
And this body, it becomes divided into many parts.

89
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
So don't do that to Me.

90
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,060
This is the greatest suffering I can have from you.

91
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,420
I request you not to do that because I have taken you into My Being,

92
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,420
and you are part and parcel of Me.

93
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,960
You are one of the thousand petals of My Sahasrar,

94
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,500
and I don’t want these petals to be broken by you

95
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,580
and to be trampled by others.

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
You have your own dignity, and respect the dignity of others.

97
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,980
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,

98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,780
you must know.

99
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,940
You are not ordinary people.

100
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,360
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect others.

101
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,520
This is one thing I have to tell you:

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,640
that among yourselves you should be very humble

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,980
and very friendly and extremely sweet.

104
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,500
Also when you will start doing that gradually you will learn a method

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,640
by which you’ll be very sweet.

106
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,480
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

107
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,900
It is better to be beaten up than to be beating others.

108
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:33,200
It is better to be simple and deceived than to be deceiving others.

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,640
We are like the shield and the shield has to fight the sword.

110
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,020
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, the shield does.

111
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,240
This is, you must understand, that for anything

112
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,640
no harsh words needs to be said. Keep quiet.

113
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,500
Just try to control your tongue.

114
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,700
That is one thing:

115
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,020
that there should not be disunity because you are collectively conscious among yourselves.

116
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
If there is disunity among you,

117
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,880
you cannot be one: then how can we think of the whole world being one? Just think of it!

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:33,060
And your responsibility is much greater because you are the first people who have got it in the whole of Europe and the whole of England.

119
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,540
Respect each other.

120
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,940
Think of the good points everyone has.

121
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,280
Try to love.

122
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,600
If I were like you:

123
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,640
you know I am complete I have no problem -

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,440
why am I bothering?

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,940
Because I love you.

126
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,240
If you love each other you will see the good points of another,

127
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,060
and you will imbibe them.

128
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,360
Try to love each other

129
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,860
But do not confuse this love with a carnal love.

130
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,700
his is Divine love:

131
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:26,160
absolutely pure, elevating, helping you to ascend.

132
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,320
Tonight you promise Me that

133
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,680
you will look at every sahaja yogi

134
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
as a person in bondage in love

135
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,860
and not in hatred.

136
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,600
And if somebody you think is not doing right or going bad,

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,420
then you cure that person sitting in the house.

138
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,400
You know how to cure.

139
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:58,020
But do not be harsh. By talking ill you are not going to do anything to him.

140
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,920
You use your methods which you know very well.

141
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,000
This is one point. And that will give Me the greatest pleasure, the greatest of all:

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,760
when I will see all my children loving each other,

143
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
being kind to each other,

144
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,640
running to do for others, trying to help each other

145
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,140
and extremely humbled down.

146
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,980
Some of you are better off, some of you are more intelligent,

147
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,180
some of you have got more heart qualities.

148
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,740
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence,

149
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:33,760
or somebody who has little less of love
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence

150
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,300
or somebody who has little less of love.

151
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,740
May be that person just he wants more love.

152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,400
But try to give than to expect others to give.

153
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,420
Then the second one: I want you, all of you,

154
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,560
today, to know that you are the people

155
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,100
who have to build up sahaja yoga in your country

156
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,500
and also in other countries wherever you go.

157
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
So you have to give it like seeds

158
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,080
and the seeds which has to grow the Whole Tree!

159
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,100
You have to bear all other trees - so how important you are!

160
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
So today you have to resolve

161
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,960
that in your personal life you are going to be honest.

162
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,940
You are going to watch yourself, you are going to introspect yourself,

163
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
you are not going to tell lies.

164
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,920
And you are going to look after your chastity, look after your life

165
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,660
as a very precious thing!

166
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,120
And you are not going to cheat yourself.

167
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,400
And you are not going to debase yourself.

168
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,740
And you are not going to denigrate yourself,

169
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,140
in your own eyes!

170
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,400
But develop those eyes which criticise all these things and can see Yourself.

171
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,160
Today you must promise Me that you will meditate, you’ll introspect

172
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,280
than getting into your ego.

173
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,980
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog

174
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,300
— that is God’s own methods —  at any cost!

175
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,060
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don’t criticise!

176
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,320
This is you must promise Me.

177
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,980
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

178
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,440
It’s finished. It’s forgiven. But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

179
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,320
because now you are put into a higher position. You are put into a higher position, today.

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,300
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any cost, I think!

181
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,740
Because then you criticise God.

182
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,100
If you don't understand - ask Me.

183
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,660
And now you know

184
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,520
you are the people, God has sent only those who really know

185
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,220
that Sahaja Yoga is the ONLY way.

186
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,380
It is revealed to you only, very few people, that this is the Truth.

187
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,980
And this is going to save the whole humanity and all the people.

188
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,040
And God can be ONLY understood through Sahaja Yoga.

189
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,140
Nobody is going to decry Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,960
Nor anyone is going to say that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga".

191
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:23,960
Anybody who can say that has been always, so far, we have seen in our practices in Sahaja yoga for the last now so many years,

192
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,500
that anyone who takes up upon to themselves that "I am the Sahaja Yoga"

193
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,640
has had the worst possible falls of all Sahaj Yogis.

194
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,160
Don't do it.

195
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:40,620
We are a part and parcel of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people, being one with people.

196
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,620
So nobody should criticise Sahaja Yog.

197
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,240
Nobody should take chances with Sahaja Yog.

198
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,200
And forth: you have to be obedient to Me.

199
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,480
I have been telling you, in a different way

200
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,240
and every way that you should understand.

201
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Now good point.

202
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Today you have done this puja,

203
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,760
I want to tell you that on you Own,

204
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,960
on your free will, with your own understanding

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,160
you have to be obedient to Me.

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,780
This is your own decision.

207
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,100
I can not force obedience on you,

208
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,180
but you must understand it is for your own good.

209
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,920
Because every minute I can see your future, I can see your past, I can see your ascent, I can see everything.

210
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,400
If I say anything at that moment, it may appear a little bit unreasonable, but just obey Me, what I tell you!

211
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,300
I am not asking too much, you have seen: not much, as other gurus do.

212
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

213
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,820
They will hang the disciple in the well half way down.

214
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:52,340
He is just there, from his waste, you see, they will be hanging a rope up.

215
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,500
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial, test) like this horrible ones.

216
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,220
They will throw him into some place.

217
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,920
7 like this, they are all together 108 parikshas.

218
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,700
And then they'll say, "come along". Then they will try [to teach you], it starts after all.

219
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
I am not taking your test.

220
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,240
But obedience is very necessary,

221
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,220
because I know everything.

222
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't help it, you can not have another opinion about My [ ] because that is it.

223
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,640
And if I say something, I would not say normally,

224
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,280
I will not hurt you, you know that.

225
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,800
I hate to hurt you, after any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

226
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,360
But I have to do it, because you are my dearest children.

227
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,300
And you are My [will] and you have to do the most important thing on Earth so be careful.

228
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,940
Whatever I have told you, you have to obey. For today for this place

229
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,980
and today's function [ ] these are the three clear restrictions.

230
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,180
I have not asked for much.

231
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,860
But it was very difficult.

232
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,940
They are difficult.

233
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,720
Look after yourself, try to be good sahaja yogis,

234
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,960
be sweet to each other, kind to each other

235
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440
Don't deceive yourself,

236
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,460
look after your vibrations at everything will work out.
