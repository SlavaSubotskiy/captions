1
00:00:15,510 --> 00:01:07,570
as you know our second chakra is very

2
00:00:26,349 --> 00:01:12,070
important so what is the swadhishthana

3
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:16,080
is the general it's very important

4
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:19,680
because in this Kaliyuga

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,680
swadishtana box

6
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:35,470
we have so many agents to make it work

7
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:43,240
and work very hard you know what is the

8
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:48,700
second chakra interstate 8 Kappa what

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:54,670
happens that we have caught up by our

10
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:58,360
ambition and the ambition needs to run

11
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:03,430
up and down and I'll see it marry sir

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:08,370
you breeze also getting lost so it's a

13
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,370
very important a for all of them

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:23,040
so second chakra is important because in

15
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:28,610
modern times it is very very costly as

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:34,129
well exactly we become radiant

17
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:40,909
overactive and we start thinking about

18
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:43,519

19
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,409
bothering our heads

20
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,120

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:56,299
it bothers your head it troubles you a

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,299

74
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:58,430
to become is your surgeries I had no

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,880
swadishtana to bother Australia is

76
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:09,100
really great to have beautiful children

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:11,570

78
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,070
that is first thing you must do is to

79
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:20,930

so you should just think

89
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:17,110

90
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:42,409
