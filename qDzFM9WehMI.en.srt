1
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:21,257
You see, here we are in the seminar and we
are all Sahaja Yogis and we are having a good

2
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:26,817
time, we are cracking jokes, we’re discussing
things, etc., etc.

3
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:32,867
But, this is all very well, I mean, one can
enjoy oneself, in fact one should enjoy oneself

4
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:37,547
because the whole creation has been created
in such a way that we should enjoy ourselves.

5
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:44,187
From the dawn of the creation, the Shri Adi
Shakti of the Universe has played out a drama

6
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:50,057
using Her Deities, using all the powers that
She created, to create a Universe so beautiful

7
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:55,707
that it should be possible for us to live
in it in complete joy and complete enjoyment

8
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:56,707
of our existence.

9
00:16:56,707 --> 00:17:00,217
If one gives you an example…

10
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:04,267
Yesterday we sat and we listened to ragas.

11
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:08,618
These ragas themselves were inspired by the
Shri Adi Shakti in realized souls those who

12
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,727
gave them to the world.

13
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,786
The whole thing has been created by Her in
different aspects.

14
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:22,087
So that we should enjoy ourselves and so that
we should not be miserable.

15
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,757
And why does She want us to be happy?

16
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:29,027
Because it is when you are happy and relaxed
than the power of God can work on you, to

17
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:34,926
raise you to a great height for which you
are destined.

18
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:42,157
You see, this whole drama that has taken place
is not a drama without purpose.

19
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:46,997
Within it lies something that is profoundly
important and that something which is profoundly

20
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:52,277
important is the awareness of God the Absolute
the Almighty.

21
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:57,286
And this is the whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga.

22
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:02,846
All the different techniques we use are a
bridge to this.

23
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:07,687
You see, you have to understand what is Shri
Mataji on this Earth.

24
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,906
She is the Adi Shakti.

25
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:12,646
Now, how many people know what is the Adi
Shakti?

26
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:16,456
The Adi Shakti is the power of God Almighty
Himself.

27
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:22,307
It is the highest manifest thing in the Universe.

28
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:27,676
When this thing takes Avatara in the Universe
for the first time, there must be a profound

29
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:30,377
significance behind this.

30
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:38,137
And this profound significance must be the
awareness of the Lord the Almighty.

31
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:43,706
In your body are placed the various chakras
of the tantra.

32
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,046
The instrument.

33
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,066
Tantra means instrument.

34
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:49,667
What are this chakras for?

35
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:54,607
And people spend a lot of time cleaning them,
taking them out, putting them in salt water,

36
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,206
putting them back again.

37
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:58,706
But for what purpose?

38
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,387
You see, you have to think for what purpose.

39
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,196
Try to think why you are here instead of doing
things routinely.

40
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:10,596
The chakras raise the awareness of the human
individual from step to step, higher and higher

41
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,456
until it can reach the throne of the Almighty
Himself.

42
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,566
That is their purpose.

43
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:20,576
So, those who do not use it for that are like
a man who has a Rolls Royce who takes it apart,

44
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:26,107
puts it in oil, puts it together again, starts
the engine and goes nowhere.

45
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:32,657
You see, the whole tantras have been given
to you to raise your attention to the Absolutely

46
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:34,107
the Almighty.

47
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,506
The whole of Sahaja Yoga has been given to
you to raise your attention to the Absolute

48
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:38,997
the Almighty.

49
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:41,096
Your friends are given to you for this purpose.

50
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,796
And the Shri Adi Shakti Herself has appeared
before you to give you this.

51
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:52,576
Now, there is no doubt that Shri Adi Shakti
is Mahamaya.

52
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:53,887
What does Mahamaya mean?

53
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:56,817
And why is She Mahamaya?

54
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,737
You see, you should question these basic fundamentals.

55
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:03,967
After all, God is the Prime Architect of the
Universe.

56
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,287
There is nothing that He does that is purposeless.

57
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,927
You have to understand this.

58
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:15,407
If we have purpose in what we do in our limitations
how much greater is His purpose?

59
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:24,537
You see, if a long time ago, more than 1,400
years ago, Shri Adi Shankaracharya told human

60
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:30,947
beings, “You are the Absolute, there is
no difference between you and God the Almighty,

61
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:31,947
Adwaita."

62
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:38,647
Now, if you are the Absolute, the Atma unless
you are diluted, there can be no creation,

63
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:39,647
isn’t it?

64
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:45,327
Because if you are always aware that you’re
the Atma Tattwa, how can you be involved in

65
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,327
creation?

66
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:50,127
You’ll always be lost in meditation on your
own existence.

67
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,877
You have to understand this basic fact.

68
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:58,447
So, the Mahamaya was necessary for the creation.

69
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:02,197
She was necessary for the evolution of the
creation.

70
00:21:02,197 --> 00:21:06,467
Because by playing out dramas for you she
evolves you.

71
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:10,107
And it’s only when you reach a certain level
that She can liberate you from herself.

72
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:15,107
So, that you see beyond the Maya, the Absolute.

73
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:21,057
Now, there is a saying in one of the Puranas
that, “The Devi can only be worshiped by

74
00:21:21,057 --> 00:21:23,917
those who are both, intelligent and brave."

75
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:27,317
And She cannot be worshiped by the stupid
and the cowardly.

76
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:32,347
This is very important, you see, we have been
given brains.

77
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:35,877
We haven’t been given brains to sort out
trivialities of life.

78
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:40,277
We have been given brains to chart our course
to the Almighty the Absolute.

79
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:44,107
She is not going to spoon-feed you.

80
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:48,517
Beyond a certain point you have to find the
course for yourself.

81
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:53,197
The reason for this is that unless you do
so you are not worthy to be presented before

82
00:21:53,197 --> 00:21:54,197
the Almighty.

83
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:58,447
Only those who are using their courage and
their intelligence, the strength of their

84
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:04,077
desire can find the course, are worthy really
to come before Him.

85
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:11,877
This is all part of the evolution of mankind.

86
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:16,287
To understand and appreciate the Almighty
you have to have an awareness that is capable

87
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:19,767
of receiving it.

88
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:24,637
About two years ago Shri Mataji came to Riyadh
and I’ve written a Sanskrit poem which I

89
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:25,807
presented to Her.

90
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:29,717
And She began to complete it for me because
it was incomplete.

91
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:34,957
And one of the verses was, “…how can I
pour all this into such small cups?

92
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:35,957
..."

93
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:39,977
You see, because the awareness, the brain
is not yet developed to the point it can take

94
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:44,317
the radiation, the full weight of radiation
of the Almighty into it.

95
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:47,087
So, how are you going to develop the brain?

96
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:50,707
After all, the brain is the Agnya chakra.

97
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:58,797
You develop the brain by focusing it on the
nature of the Almighty the Absolute.

98
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:01,877
Contemplating it every day of one’s existence.

99
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:06,277
In this way the attention goes up to it.

100
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:07,867
And the nerves in the brain get refined.

101
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:13,357
The petals of the Sahastrara get refined to
the point that they can receive the grace

102
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:17,727
of the Absolute and His awareness.

103
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,687
The Shri Adi Shakti is His Shakti.

104
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,907
She is the power by which all things are done.

105
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:26,016
She is the one who refine your brain for you.

106
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:29,317
But you yourself have to put your attention
there.

107
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:36,587
It is very easy in Sahaja Yoga because one
is left alone a lot to put one’s attention

108
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:39,917
on trivialities.

109
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:44,027
A chakra may catch.

110
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:45,477
But what does it matter?

111
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:49,977
The catch may release within five or ten minutes.

112
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:53,707
So, why bother about it?

113
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:56,607
That we know that the catches move from chakra
to chakra.

114
00:23:56,607 --> 00:24:03,097
That the movement of the kundalini moves from
chakra to chakra.

115
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:29,597
So, what is the purpose of concentrating on
things that are trivial?

116
00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:34,526
In the past, you see, many great seekers came
on this Earth to seek God.

117
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:35,677
After what are you seeking?

118
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:36,927
What does seeking mean?

119
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:38,487
It means to seek God.

120
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:42,497
They had no Shri Adi Shakti to help them.

121
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,977
You have it here in front of you.

122
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:49,956
So, you should take advantage of it.

123
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:58,367
And try and become fixed at that point which
is the Absolute.

124
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:05,207
And you may all be here in a collective but
the relationship between you and the Absolute

125
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:08,807
has to be individual between you and Him alone.

126
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,206
And when you see Him, you don’t see anyone
else.

127
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,336
You see.

128
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:19,047
It is very good to be in the collective, it
is very good to be with each other to enjoy

129
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:28,716
each other’s company but your relationship
with each other should be such that it fosters

130
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:32,117
that ascent to the Divine the Absolute.

131
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,896
We have to be very clear.

132
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:37,857
The whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga is this ascent.

133
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:43,437
The great Goddess Herself the Shri Adi Shakti
has a devotion to our Lord which is indescribable

134
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:46,237
in human terms.

135
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:50,936
The whole play between the Almighty and the
Shakti is something which is one of the profoundest

136
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:56,406
mysteries of mankind and of the Creation.

137
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:01,716
And the deepest desire of the Shri Adi Shakti
is the ascent of Her creation and Her children

138
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:05,886
to the throne of the Almighty as an offering
to Her Lord.

139
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:11,896
Just as we, when we present an offering to
Shri Mataji if there are flowers, we take

140
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:15,227
out the worst flowers, we present only the
best, the most perfect.

141
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:20,677
So, when the Shri Adi Shakti offers to Her
Lord Her Creation it is something at a level

142
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:22,737
far removed from this.

143
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:27,947
And only the most perfect that can be presented
before Him.

144
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:28,947
You see.

145
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:31,257
You have to understand this.

146
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,198
As human beings we have no importance.

147
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:41,256
Except, in so far as we play a part in this
play between the Lord and His Shakti.

148
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:48,067
The entire creation can be discarded, if it
does not serve this purpose.

149
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:53,586
Cause there are only two things which are
real in the Universe and that is the Lord

150
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:54,586
and His Shakti.

151
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:59,787
All else is superfluous to this and of no
importance.

152
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:04,257
At the end of creation only those two things
will remain.

153
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:11,016
So, you must not take lightly what is happening.

154
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:14,406
You are the essential parts and pieces of
this drama.

155
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:21,547
This very profound drama which is the basis
and the internal root of the Universe.

156
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:26,557
Have you ever considered why the Mooladhara
chakra has four petals?

157
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,946
What does it mean?

158
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,137
Why four?

159
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:36,227
It is four because if you combine the Lord
and the Shakti in the Sushumna where Their

160
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:38,937
feet rest you will find four feet resting.

161
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:44,607
It is the… that is why it is the ultimate
purity because it represents the combined

162
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:50,436
feet of the Lord and his Shakti and that is
given as a throne to the son, Ganesha, the

163
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,006
Lord, the Omkara to sit on.

164
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,757
These things are very important, very profound.

165
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:06,136
To be the seat of the play of the Lord and
Shakti one needs extreme purity, extreme wisdom

166
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:09,227
and extreme awareness of what is happening.

167
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:13,667
The whole purpose of this creation is that
and that alone.

168
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:17,357
The creation was not made for you to iron
saris.

169
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:19,406
To worry about your dhobi [laundryman].

170
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,706
These are totally irrelevant.

171
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:33,376
They won’t even last a century, leave alone
eternity.

172
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:34,847
Nor is organization there.

173
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:38,186
You can organize till you’re blue in the
face but unless the desire of the Absolute

174
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:41,977
works you will not get another Sahaja Yogi.

175
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:42,977
You have seen this.

176
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:43,977
Many of you have.

177
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:48,896
We had many wonderful experiences in the early
days when we turned up at empty halls in spite

178
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,167
of massive publicity.

179
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:53,706
You see, you do not do anything.

180
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:57,256
Lord Krishna when He came He said, “You
do not do anything.

181
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:58,776
I do it all."

182
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:01,847
So, the human being who deludes himself into
thinking he is doing.

183
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:02,847
He is not doing.

184
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:03,997
He said, “Act!

185
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:05,997
You have to act.

186
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:09,686
But leave the results of your actions to Me."

187
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:16,646
So, act without expectation is what He is
saying.

188
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:20,507
Now, how are you going to awaken?

189
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:24,047
What you are going to do?

190
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:28,316
You see, when one acts, everyone knows what
the left side is what the right side is.

191
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:32,417
One acts by the right using the power of desire
of the left.

192
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,017
This is something that is well known to everybody.

193
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:38,227
Through which chakra does one act?

194
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:39,567
Which is the chakra of activity?

195
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,507
Who will answer it?

196
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:43,507
Of creation?

197
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:48,937
You must all know this, it’s basic stuff.

198
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:49,937
The Swadhisthana.

199
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:50,937
Ok.

200
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:53,136
The Swadhisthana is on the right, is it not?

201
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:54,506
And the Shuddha Ichha is on the left.

202
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:58,516
So, what is the bridge between the desire
of God the Almighty and action?

203
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,066
It is the left Swadhisthana chakra.

204
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,066
Correct?

205
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,956
And that is why all boots go and sit there.

206
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,307
To disconnect your action from your desire.

207
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,366
Very simple, you see.

208
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:17,806
Wherever the boots hit hard you must know
that is an important chakra.

209
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:25,357
Now, you see, although we are human beings,
we are by the grace of God enlightened souls.

210
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:31,357
This means that the entire tantra of the Universe
is present in miniature within us.

211
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:35,377
This Shri Mataji has done and She said, “I’ve
placed you there.

212
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,506
Now, what you do with yourself is your affair."

213
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:45,427
Now, as the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe
… Does everyone know what the Shuddha Ichha

214
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,427
is?

215
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,116
The Shuddha Ichha is the pure desire of the
Universe.

216
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:50,767
Now, what is the pure desire of the Universe?

217
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:55,006
The pure desire of the Universe is God, the
desire of God Almighty Himself.

218
00:30:55,006 --> 00:31:00,456
As this flows through the Ida nadi of the
Universe and is carried by the Goddess Shri

219
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:05,776
Mahakali to be placed, deposited within the
kundalini.

220
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:12,487
So, this flows within your left side or can
flow within your left side if you desire it.

221
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:13,906
To inform your activities.

222
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:19,836
Now, you see, unless you are connected your
activities are without meaning.

223
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:24,056
It is like ants scurrying around not knowing
what they are doing.

224
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:27,867
So, first, one has to establish within oneself
the pure desire.

225
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:30,966
Let it flow within your Ida nadi.

226
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,576
How would you do that?

227
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:34,037
It’s very simple.

228
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:38,247
You pray to Shri Mataji and you say, “You
are the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe and

229
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:42,186
I worship You as such."

230
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:46,737
If you just do that, pray to Her, pray to
Her, is this, She will flow with such force

231
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:52,206
within your Ida nadis that She will break
anything that is in your left Swadhisthana

232
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,316
and flow into the right.

233
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:57,186
To inform your activity.

234
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:03,006
You cannot catch on the right side if your
left side is strong.

235
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,006
You see.

236
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,797
So, that is the first stage.

237
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:11,016
If you do that the Shuddha Ichha, you don’t
need to do more than this, the Shuddha Ichha

238
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:16,057
will flow through all your chakras, it will
eventually break open the barriers that are

239
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:24,446
in your brain and infuse with enlightenment
and nectar every nerve fiber and cell within

240
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,446
your brain.

241
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:31,886
As it does that your whole consciousness and
awareness will be altered.

242
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:37,987
As it is altered your awareness will be filled
with the awareness of the Absolute.

243
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:43,186
As it is filled with the awareness of the
Absolute you will see Shri Mataji clearly

244
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:46,907
for what She is which is the Shakti of God
Almighty Himself.

245
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:50,977
We will not say, “Shri Mataji did this,
Shri Mataji did that,” you know, all the

246
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:52,317
Maya and the play.

247
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:55,037
Some people fill tragic one minute, happy
next…

248
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,577
This is all nonsense.

249
00:32:56,577 --> 00:33:02,586
If you are based in yourself you will remain
absolutely stable in the sight of your parents,

250
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:04,347
in the sight of the Almighty.

251
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:07,437
You do not shift from day to day.

252
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:08,447
You don’t doubt yourself.

253
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:12,767
You cannot become Nirvikalpa until you know
this.

254
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:17,367
Because part of the Nirvikalpa is not just
doubting God or Shri Mataji.

255
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,887
It’s very easy not to do that.

256
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:22,377
It’s not doubting yourself as an extension
of Them.

257
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:27,067
Because as Shri Mataji said, She has made
every single one of us into a part of Her

258
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,067
body.

259
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:32,937
So, to doubt oneself is in a sense to doubt
Her.

260
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:39,707
Now, people try to avoid recognizing what
has been done to them by getting Realization

261
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:42,217
in Sahaja Yoga.

262
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:44,787
You don’t want to see that they have been
made a part of the body of God Almighty Himself

263
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:46,387
in a sense of His Shakti.

264
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:51,897
Because this means that you can’t behave
in the same old ways you used to behave.

265
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:58,647
You can’t be attached to the same old things
which you used to be attached to.

266
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:30,177
You have to change, you see.

267
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:31,177
Ready?

268
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:32,177
Ok.

269
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:37,027
And this is something that people don’t
understand.

270
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:40,537
And this is an avoidance of Sahaja Yoga, this
is running away from it.

271
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,687
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is the fact that
people have been …, human being has been

272
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:50,307
taken, they have been given realization, they
have been made part of the body of the Divine

273
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:54,857
and they have been given the opportunity to
raise their awareness to the highest level

274
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,027
to attain God realization.

275
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,637
That is it.

276
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,247
It’s very simple.

277
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:06,177
Everything else is a waste of time.

278
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:10,027
And one has to recognize that although we
may be Sahaja Yogis we do not run the Universe;

279
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:12,127
the Universe is run by us.

280
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:16,687
I mean, run for us by the Almighty.

281
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:20,887
And run by us for the Almighty.

282
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:24,947
We cannot decide this has to happen, this
has to happen, we have to have twenty people

283
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:25,947
next week.

284
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:27,207
Cannot happen.

285
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:35,407
God decides how many people He wants, He decides
where and when, you just have to be instruments.

286
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:40,537
Not one of us can change the Universe even
so much.

287
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:46,377
Unless we do it in the… on the crest of
a wave which precedes from the Almighty and

288
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,517
work as instruments.

289
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:55,267
The old days of siddhic Yogis who ride on
clouds and transform mountains and hurl thunderbolts

290
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:56,807
are over, you see.

291
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:59,077
That was meant for people who are right sided.

292
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:01,337
Who wanted to do things themselves.

293
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:02,927
That is not us.

294
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,437
We are parts of the body of the Goddess.

295
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:08,527
And each one of us has to be like e nerve
cell.

296
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,377
When the brain tells us what to do, we have
to do it.

297
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:16,077
As such we are all collective.

298
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,147
That is the true collectivity.

299
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:21,397
And if we… each of us recognize that we
are a nerve cell in the brain of the Goddess,

300
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:27,367
permeating Her whole being then the whole
boundaries between nationalities, and this

301
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,847
and that which keeps Sahaja Yogis apart dissolves.

302
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:35,867
We all realize we are one, we are the same,
that each one of us is individual and each

303
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:39,127
one of us has an individual relationship to
the Almighty.

304
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:43,807
And all sorts of misidentifications fall away.

305
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:50,887
Now one speaks a common language, no doubt
about it, it is real.

306
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,357
And this is the common language of vibrations.

307
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:58,097
If you are there you do not know how but you
communicate with people who have a different

308
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,097
language.

309
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:01,647
It’s so simple really.

310
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:07,427
So, I wish really in this lecture to make
you aware of what is been given in Sahaja

311
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,427
Yoga.

312
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:14,277
What has been done by the Great Goddess in
Her absolute nature and for what purpose.

313
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:20,887
So that you do not waste neither time nor
energy on other things.

314
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,297
There is nothing greater than this.

315
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:30,457
And since the Goddess Herself is All Powerful,
beyond time, beyond everything.

316
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:38,557
So, your awareness has to be of a nature that
can comprehend that and be one with that awareness.

317
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:42,157
You can become one with Her in awareness,
no doubt.

318
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,897
And see things as She sees things.

319
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:48,307
But for this your brain has to develop, you
see.

320
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,427
So, this is what one has to do.

321
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:55,017
And really the rest of it is not important.

322
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:58,287
At that level, it doesn’t matter how time
passes.

323
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,687
At that level, it doesn’t matter whether
there are miracles or not because the whole

324
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:04,847
concept of a miracle is non-existent.

325
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:07,207
Everything follows the desire of the Absolute.

326
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:11,677
Who makes the rules that arbitrates between
a miracle and a non-miracle?

327
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:13,047
Humans beings.

328
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:15,087
It’s not God.

329
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,567
For God there is no such things as a miracle.

330
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,787
Everything is possible to Him.

331
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:29,907
So, what I’m saying is hitch your awareness
higher, hook it at the higher level, keep

332
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,907
it there.

333
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:34,637
So that you see really what is happening.

334
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:40,267
And do not, in spite of everything that has
been given, continue to move in the same circles,

335
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:44,507
low circles that one inhabited before one’s
realization.

336
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:46,029
This is very important.

337
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:51,937
This is so important that I don’t know how
to say it.

338
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:59,017
Work to increase the structure and capacity
of one’s brain, so that you can comprehend

339
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:02,837
that which is Absolute.

340
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:10,687
I do not know if there is anything more to
say to this.

341
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:16,917
I remember once a long time back when I first
met Shri Mataji, Gregoire was there, lots

342
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:19,097
of other chappies were there jumping around
with me.

343
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:24,147
I remember one, early one morning after we
slept with Her in a flat in London, I was

344
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:28,347
talking to Her and She says… you see…
we were talking about Maya.

345
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,487
And I said, “Mother, I wish I could go beyond
Maya."

346
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:35,497
And She said to me, this was some seven or
eight years ago, and She said to me, “One

347
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,777
day you will, you will catch me."

348
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:42,937
She said, “You will catch me."

349
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:49,347
And what I’m trying to say, is that this
is what we should all aim for.

350
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,307
Try to go beyond that.

351
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:56,577
And you can only go beyond that when you can
touch the feet of the Absolute.

352
00:39:56,577 --> 00:40:01,437
The Absolute is like a mountain peak which
raises above the clouds.

353
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:05,787
You cannot rise above the clouds until you
rest on that mountain peak.

354
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:11,387
So, you cannot rise above Maya, it is impossible
until your awareness touches the feet of the

355
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,137
Absolute.

356
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:20,047
Because above Maya there is nothing but the
Absolute, The Atma Tattwa.

357
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:30,287
You know, the Atma Tattwa rests in the Heart
of God the Almighty and ascends to dance in

358
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:33,017
the Sahastrara as Sadashiva.

359
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:35,597
So, the heart is a very important organ.

360
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:40,557
Rajabhai said that when Shri Mataji gave him
realization, She said, “You young men have

361
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:45,137
such hard hearts."

362
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,287
And She was true in the sense.

363
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,707
Most people do have hard hearts.

364
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:50,107
Not necessary their fault.

365
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:54,877
It may be the result of their experiences
in this world.

366
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:56,337
But one’s heart should be like a lotus.

367
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,607
I don’t know how many of you have touched
a lotus.

368
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:02,497
But the petals are so soft, like silk.

369
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:08,417
The heart of a man should be as soft as that.

370
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:14,027
You see, we have got our realization regardless
of everything we have done.

371
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:19,927
By the grace of God, the Almighty, by His
compassion, profound compassion, profound

372
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:23,587
love for mankind, for the children of His
Shakti.

373
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:27,837
He has granted – He says forget everything,
forget it, forget it.

374
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:30,077
Forgive, you see, I forgive them.

375
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:31,207
I forgive them.

376
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:35,057
We have to be the same in our hearts to the
rest of the mankind.

377
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:39,887
When the disciples of Christ, Peter I think,
once came to Christ and asked them: “How

378
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:42,067
often should I forgive my brothers, seven
times?”

379
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,937
And He said, “No, seventy times seven."

380
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:51,157
And what He meant was infinitely.

381
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:54,957
You see, one cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi,
this is my belief, unless one is kind, and

382
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:59,097
one is gentle.

383
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:01,367
Kindness and gentle doesn’t mean weakness.

384
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:07,617
It means being soft, trying to further the
other person from one’s heart, caring for

385
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:10,737
what Shri Mataji once called in Her lecture,
caring for his hita [benevolence].

386
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:16,287
Try to see what is… how to do that which
is best for him, how to manipulate him in

387
00:42:16,287 --> 00:42:20,367
such a way that he raises.

388
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:27,597
It means, going beyond oneself, you see, when
someone is harsh with you, is he harsh with

389
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:28,597
you?

390
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:31,197
If you are Atma how he can be harsh with you?

391
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:35,147
If you are the Atma you can bear it all.

392
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:38,257
And in spite of that try and resolve.

393
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:48,787
The only thing we cannot really be expected
to tolerate is any insult to the Goddess Herself.

394
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,707
There we have to be strong and firm.

395
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:56,617
But it doesn’t mean that we take justice
in our own hands.

396
00:42:56,617 --> 00:43:01,027
Justice is …, belongs to the Almighty, not
to us.

397
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:03,377
Christ also said, “Judge not that ye be
not judged."

398
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:07,007
Made it very clear, that we have no right
to judge.

399
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:10,737
We are not going to be sitting there, at the
end writing out who should go to hell and

400
00:43:10,737 --> 00:43:12,157
who should go to heaven.

401
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,957
It is going to be done by someone else.

402
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:17,027
So, we cannot judge.

403
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:24,397
We have to leave it to God to judge and for
us to execute.

404
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:30,487
We cannot abrogate to ourselves any of the
qualities of the Almighty, such as justice,

405
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,947
judgment, decisiveness, planning.

406
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:35,387
These belong to Him.

407
00:43:35,387 --> 00:43:38,847
We merely execute these.

408
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:47,327
But when we are kind to a fellow man, to any
living thing that moves, within the context

409
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,507
of its dharma on this world, we make the Lord
happy.

410
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:57,347
By this I don’t mean that one goes around
like jains, not trying to kill insects because

411
00:43:57,347 --> 00:44:00,437
it is in the dharma of the insects to be crushed
beneath the feet of man.

412
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:04,777
We’ve been both created this way that it
has… it is an inevitable outcome of living

413
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:05,807
a normal life.

414
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:08,777
One doesn’t go crazy, you see.

415
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:09,777
We have to eat.

416
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:15,127
Chicken, I mean it doesn’t mean you don’t
slaughter a chicken to be kind to it.

417
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:17,617
We have to live within the boundaries.

418
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:22,467
But there is no place for unnecessary cruelty
in this world.

419
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:25,887
The Lord is not cruel.

420
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:30,707
And if we are to partake of his essence and
of his nature we have to be like Him.

421
00:44:30,707 --> 00:44:41,497
So, the message I’m trying to give you is
that in spite of all the splendor that surrounds

422
00:44:41,497 --> 00:44:46,567
the Goddess and there must be because She
is, after all, the Shri Adi Shakti, do not

423
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:51,578
forget that the deepest desire in our heart,
the Shuddha Ichha, is to raise you to the

424
00:44:51,578 --> 00:44:58,347
feet of Her Lord as offerings worthy of Him.

425
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:07,887
And in all Her drama She tries constantly
in Her movement to bring you to that point.

426
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:11,227
And I tell you that there is nothing else
in the Universe worth bothering about except

427
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:12,877
this fact.

428
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:20,697
If you love your Mother try to be worthy to
be offered by Her to Her Consort.

429
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:30,577
And if you love your Father try to be worthy
to be offered to Him.

430
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:36,387
And if you love Them both this will work out
inevitably because Their love will work through

431
00:45:36,387 --> 00:45:45,377
your heart, and the two will mingle, and you
cannot help but ascent.

432
00:45:45,377 --> 00:45:48,157
Live by your hearts not by your brains.

433
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:53,157
That is not by your egos and superegos and
question the inner desires of your heart.

434
00:45:53,157 --> 00:45:54,157
Do not question them.

435
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:55,197
You cannot question them.

436
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:58,117
They are beyond logic.

437
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,117
Live by your heart.

438
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:06,477
If you express your heart you will lead to
such a sense of satisfaction with life that

439
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:08,897
you cannot be angry with anyone.

440
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:14,047
You will be so happy all the time that it’ll
be effortless for your Parents to lift you

441
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:18,607
to that level which was your destiny at the
moment of your creation.

442
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:20,817
That is all I have to say.

443
00:46:20,997 --> 00:46:26,077
Jai Shri Mataji.
