1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:15,710
Why I asked him to talk to arrange a meeting 
with you people is this

2
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:25,359
because I’ve discovered that in Kali Yuga, 
especially in the West, the problem will be

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:36,430
coming from the women.

4
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,200
We have had a very bad problem in Australia, 
you must have heard about it.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,730
Have you heard about it?

6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,970
It’s a very serious problem.

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,790
Now this wife has shown her ego so clearly.

8
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:08,180
And She said: “I won’t listen to Mother, 
I know I’m bhootish and I can’t help it

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:17,010
now anymore, and I want to disappear, with 
my parents I’ll live, I’ll take my children

10
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,100
there, and do what you like.

11
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,390
In case you want to have [the] children I 
will fight you”.

12
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:38,010
Because of her, these children had meningitis, 
they were about to die, when I just was there

13
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,890
I saved them.

14
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:53,010
But when in a negative woman, the ego enters, 
then nobody can help.

15
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:06,270
I, being a woman, you see, I can come much 
closer to you people.

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,730
And sometimes people start thinking that the 
ladies have a special relationship with Me.

17
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:23,350
Now new one who has come is another horrible 
woman [In England].

18
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:35,030
And I don’t know what she -, how much she 
is going to destroy us and damage us.

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,790
And she wouldn’t allow anybody to talk to 
her.

20
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,190
She says: “I have a special relationship 
with Mother."

21
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,380
She wouldn’t listen to any leaders, nothing, 
and she did a horrible, horrible, horrible

22
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
thing.

23
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,700
And especially in the west, you see, with 
this woman slave and all these nonsensical

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,540
ideas have gone into the heads of even Sahaja 
Yogis.

25
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:11,630
One of the conditionings they have: women’s 
lib, the liberation of women.

26
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:25,400
Now in Sahaja Yoga nobody can dominate you, 
because you are the Spirit and Spirit cannot

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,849
be dominated.

28
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:36,590
If you think you are dominated then know that 
you are not

29
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
the Spirit.

30
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:46,070
So now we have to understand we are women 
in Sahaja Yoga and we have to understand our

31
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,820
balancing power.

32
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:56,349
As I’ve said many a time, there is a, they 
are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the

33
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,430
left, one on the right.

34
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:08,970
Now the left cannot be fixed on to the right, 
and right cannot be fixed on to the left.

35
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,489
We are made like that, we are made by the 
Divine.

36
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:24,080
But one should be very proud that you are 
women.

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,379
I am very proud that I am a woman.

38
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:36,610
Because women can perform so many things which 
men cannot do.

39
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,540
Woman is like the Mother Earth.

40
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:55,639
So, and we can say the men are like the Sun, 
both have to combine.

41
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,919
But the Sun can be eliminated, but Earth cannot.

42
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,960
The Sun is not there in the night, still we 
exist.

43
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:15,199
But look at the Mother Earth, how much she 
can bear!

44
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,870
How much she can bear.

45
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:37,129
See now, she is so sensible, she creates beautiful 
flowers, beautiful trees, everything for us

46
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:42,270
with out any grudge.

47
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:53,589
And moreover that she nourishes us, despite 
the fact we are doing so many sins against

48
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,589
her.

49
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:00,189
But the Sun doesn’t want to become the Earth 
and Earth doesn’t want to become the Sun.

50
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:10,560
Because they know they are stationed for a 
particular purpose.

51
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,060
Same women in Sahaja Yoga are very important 
for Me.

52
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:27,639
But the first thing they should have is a 
bearing power.

53
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:36,629
And also they should have lots and lots of 
love and compassion.

54
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:44,619
Supposing without Me there was, supposing 
in My place, say there was Christ.

55
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:54,749
He would have seen the condition of Sahaja 
Yogis He would have crucified Himself.

56
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:55,749
Finished.

57
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:11,960
Or if it was Krishna He would have taken a 
Sudarshan in His hand and would have cut every

58
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,319
bodies’ heads.

59
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,499
Finished.

60
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,590
If it was Rama He would have used His arrows 
and finished all of you.

61
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,830
They would not have considered anything that 
you have to have patience, you have to look

62
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,110
after, you have to bear, if you have to bear 
fruits.

63
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:39,360
So the women can only bear fruits.

64
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,729
You can only produce children, which are Realized 
Souls.

65
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:55,870
But if you go on a ego trip, you are neither 
man nor woman, you become something in between,

66
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,939
neither here nor there.

67
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,879
You are good for nothing.

68
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:11,449
So for a woman it doesn’t show, behoove 
that she should be egoistical.

69
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:19,189
It behooves better that she is more emotional.

70
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:26,780
Like she could feel sad sometimes and sometimes 
the tears can come into her eyes,

71
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,979
like you see even I start weeping sometimes.

72
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,830
When I am leaving you I feel so sad.

73
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:48,199
I don’t take out My hand and say sit down 
there, you do this, I don’t talk like that,

74
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,139
do I?

75
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,209
I never even raise My voice.

76
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,430
That’s only men can do.

77
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:05,830
Whatever they can do let them do it, what 
you can do, you can do.

78
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:12,389
Absolute womanhood is the climax for you.

79
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:23,300
The complete womanhood is the climax.

80
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,880
You should be an expert to be a woman.

81
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,890
In cooking, in gardening, in looking after 
people, in loving and just that’s how you

82
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,890
control everyone.

83
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:51,100
Looking after, you see, you can be controlling 
everyone not by all nonsensical things as

84
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,579
the men try to control, you see.

85
00:09:54,579 --> 00:10:01,819
Love is the best way to control any one.

86
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:05,040
But love means sacrifice.

87
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,600
But after sometime you won’t feel any sacrifice.

88
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:24,320
Once you start enjoying giving, then it is 
no more a sacrifice,

89
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,870
and this is what is very important especially 
for French women, because they have been very

90
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,519
dominating before.

91
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:52,060
So you have to now create a new tradition, 
a new age, a new personality, that personality

92
00:10:52,060 --> 00:11:03,839
that will, that will give protection, nourishment, 
everything to children, and companionship

93
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:16,629
and affection to your husband.

94
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:21,880
Women have been given so many qualities, because 
their lifestyle is more difficult than that

95
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,360
of men.

96
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:39,209
So I have to make one request to you that 
you must try to make yourself into a proper

97
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,449
Sahaja Yogini.

98
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:48,910
I will say I’ll give all full credit to 
Indian women, because they have created a

99
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,730
beautiful society.

100
00:11:50,730 --> 00:12:01,029
We had a prime minister as a woman, but we 
had so many great warriors as women as leaders

101
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,449
of the armies.

102
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:16,620
But this was during wartime, not all the time, 
otherwise they were just housewives.

103
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,949
So God has given you special qualities.

104
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:32,079
If you want to improve on it, if you want 
to manifest them then you have to know that

105
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:40,329
you are a woman and you have to be dignified 
like a woman.

106
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:46,360
And that works out very well.

107
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:56,970
Now supposing you are egoistical and you are 
quarrelsome and hot by temperament, then your

108
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,899
children will take after you.

109
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:09,769
They don’t, they don’t take after the 
father.

110
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,850
They take after the mother.

111
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,699
So that is why the Indian society is so good, 
society is excellent.

112
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:25,480
But Indian men are hopeless.

113
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:34,200
They have made a mess of our politics, mess 
of our economics.

114
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:44,040
But at least maybe your [French] men are better, 
I don’t know that.

115
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:52,350
I must say they are at least they are milder 
people than Indian, the men are very dominating,

116
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,449
very dominating.

117
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:57,519
But we just laugh, you know, we know that’s 
their nature is you see, just like a child

118
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:05,410
tries to dominate, the husband also tries 
to dominate.

119
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,829
And if they dominate somebody else they will 
be beaten up, so they want to dominate us.

120
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:28,899
[Shri Mataji laughts] Or else where should 
they take out their temper?

121
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,779
Yes.

122
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:42,550
So it’s nice that they are taking on us, 
otherwise outside they will be beaten up!

123
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:49,319
If you find any man to be very quiet and nice 
then know that his wife must be having a bad

124
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,319
time.

125
00:14:50,319 --> 00:15:03,029
[Shri Mataji laughts] [A Sahaja Yogini Marie 
translates this part because the Sahaja Yogi

126
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:07,600
translator has just become speechless.]

127
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,050
So you should just make a fun out of it and 
shouldn’t take it so seriously and you should

128
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,550
know that you have much more bearing power 
and you know how to handle the situation and

129
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,899
you are much wiser and much collected.

130
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,990
[Shri Mataji to Marie.]

131
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,360
Will you do it Marie?

132
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
You tell them.

133
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:39,180
If he’s a little embarrassed you’d better 
tell.

134
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,649
[Laughter.

135
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:48,070
Marie translates now] 
So life becomes a fun.

136
00:15:48,070 --> 00:16:02,660
And you see men will remain men, women will 
remain women, whatever dress you may wear.

137
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,529
You have to be what you are.

138
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:12,600
But once you know what you are you will enjoy 
yourself.

139
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Men will always see the watches.

140
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,990
Women will be always late.

141
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:32,350
Sahaja Yogi: The flight has been delayed of 
25 minutes Shri Mataji.

142
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,759
[Laughter.

143
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:42,399
Applause] 
Shri Mataji: He was seeing the watch.

144
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,399
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

145
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
Don’t keep it.

146
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:51,209
I do those tricks with My husband also.

147
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,759
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

148
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,790
See the fun.

149
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,970
You see, sometimes he is so particular.

150
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,079
I am going and he is after My life, you see.

151
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,079
“You better go now, better go now."

152
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,260
I say: “I am going, you are not going, why 
are you looking at your watches."

153
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,950
And whenever he goes with Me, he does the 
same.

154
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,270
Then always the plane is 2 hours late.

155
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,270
And he never knows.

156
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,120
Then he goes to the airport.

157
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,870
Then he finds out 2 hours late.

158
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:24,450
Then we are hanging there in the air.

159
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,390
Yes, Yes, about My husband only.

160
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:39,290
And sometimes he is going with Me just to 
leave Me, you see, there.

161
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,420
I tell him, don’t come.

162
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,030
But he”ll come and he will go on after My 
life.

163
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,030
“You’re getting late, you’re getting 
late."

164
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,770
Then the plane will be 3 hours late.

165
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,770
[Laughter.]

166
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,870
It is like that.

167
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,970
So it’s such a fun.

168
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,720
Life is make it a beautiful life.

169
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,640
No use quarrelling, fighting, becoming obstinate.

170
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:18,280
These are not good things.

171
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,820
And also it’s nice if some husband says 
that: “Do this”.

172
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
“All right I will do it” say that.

173
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:33,940
Now you do it yourself, you will like it to 
do something like that, no harm.

174
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:51,290
Or even the leader says: “You should do 
something”.

175
00:18:51,290 --> 00:19:01,220
But if you go on saying no, no to everything, 
then he gets fed up with you.

176
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,690
And there is no grace.

177
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,300
So why to create problems?

178
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:19,340
Now say, supposing somebody puts some paper 
[wallpaper] here, all right.

179
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:27,420
Now supposing I put some paper, but supposing 
My husband doesn’t like it.

180
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,600
So he will say: “All right please remove 
this paper”.

181
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,200
Now wise woman will say: “All right I will 
remove it.

182
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,880
When should I do it?”

183
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,400
“Tomorrow there is a party, so you can’t 
remove.

184
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
All right.

185
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Day after tomorrow we are going away, so you 
can’t remove.

186
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,530
All right we will do it after three days”.

187
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,510
Within three days the people who come to the 
party will definitely say: “What a nice

188
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,510
paper!”

189
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:57,400
All the ladies will say, because it’s a 
ladies’ taste.

190
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,120
You see, men want to make an office, you see.

191
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,190
So they will come, what a nice paper what 
a nice- then husband will say: “You better

192
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:44,890
keep it, it’s very nice I think”.

193
00:20:44,890 --> 00:21:21,490
That’s how they are.

194
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,670
So you understand how, you must know how to 
handle.

195
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:39,400
That’s, that’s a beauty a woman has, she 
knows how to handle the situation.

196
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,710
If she does not know how to handle the situation 
and then she just starts just jumping at husband,

197
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:57,180
jumping at children, that that shows she is 
not capable.

198
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:04,870
And the capacity of a woman is how she handles 
the situation, brings for the peace in the

199
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:17,580
family, how she makes everybody feel comfortable 
and happy.

200
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:46,000
You see how she we can say articulate with 
other people, how she makes them feel comfortable,

201
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,880
her home is her domain.

202
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,710
And in that, you see, some women are experts.

203
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,530
And that’s what you have to make your daughters 
also.

204
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,860
This is how we are going to have Sahaja Yoga 
women.

205
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:15,450
We don’t want Joan of Arcs just now.

206
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:27,180
But they have to be very brave, courageous, 
and compassionate personality.

207
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,650
And you must listen to your leaders.

208
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,940
I have so many complaints sometimes.

209
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:50,550
I cannot attend to you directly.

210
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,210
We have tried leadership with ladies, doesn’t 
work out.

211
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,930
Marie herself [the translator] was a leader, 
she gave up.

212
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:11,160
She said: “I don’t want to be a leader, 
give it to any one."

213
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
She gave up.

214
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,720
Now we have one Christine as a leader.

215
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:22,020
The other day only she telephoned to Me: “Mother 
will You please give it to somebody else."

216
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,570
[Laughter.]

217
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:43,020
Because she realizes, you see, that to handle 
these men is better to have a man, only to

218
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
handle them.

219
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

220
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:54,270
Now, men are more intelligent, no doubt, but 
women have intuition.

221
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,170
But you don’t have to argue.

222
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:11,520
It will happen, the way you have intuition 
will happen and they will learn a lesson.

223
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:21,271
So, that you don’t assert yourself, it will 
all work out the way you like, because you

224
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:32,250
have intuition, you have understood what’s 
going to happen.

225
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,680
And you’ll be amazed how it will work out.

226
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,430
All right, So now any questions.

227
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,430
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible.]

228
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:52,240
Shri Mataji: What is it?

229
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:28,120
Ask Joseph [?] 
Sahaja Yogi: She would like to know what You

230
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
mean by intelligence.

231
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Shri Mataji: Intelligence.

232
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Intelligence is gross.

233
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Say for example, with intelligence they will 
say that we are getting late, we have to go,

234
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,230
with intelligence [rationality], with the 
watch and all this.

235
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:47,330
But by intuition you will know we are not 
going to be late.

236
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,020
So you develop your intuition, not intelligence.

237
00:26:50,020 --> 00:27:01,130
You see the trouble is, you try to compete 
them with intelligence.

238
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,560
By argument you will say: “No there are 
three minutes”.

239
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,400
They will say: “Two minutes”.

240
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,770
You will say: “Three minutes”.

241
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,110
“Two minutes”.

242
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,130
Yes that’s it.

243
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,360
But actually what you should say: “All right 
lets see, three minutes, all right, lets see,

244
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,460
lets see”, like that.

245
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:28,130
And then he finds really what you said is 
true!

246
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,740
You just have to say once.

247
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Finished.

248
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
After that he says: “All right, all right”.

249
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,290
You should say: “All right we will go this 
way”.

250
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:45,730
He’ll go further: “I think we are going 
wrong, I think what you said was right, we

251
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:53,470
had to go this way”.

252
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:11,640
In Sahaja Yoga all these men and women, I 
have managed through My intuition.

253
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:21,230
But the intuition of women in the West is 
very poor I must say, because they are very

254
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,230
argumentative.

255
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:29,570
So, you see, the special quality with this 
intuition must be developed.

256
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,260
All right?

257
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:39,210
Now see the difference, because you are deep, 
you are much deeper.

258
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:47,040
In evolution you are higher, no doubt.

259
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:54,310
But you start competing with them and also 
enslaving them quite a lot.

260
00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:06,270
Like this culture in this, where we see all 
the women exposing their body just to attract

261
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:19,020
men, all the time attract the men is what?

262
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,160
Why should you attract men?

263
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Always trying to have your exposure of your 
body just to please men, why?

264
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,170
Why should we do that?

265
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,360
Why should we expose our body?

266
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,520
There’s a story Ravindranath has written 
where there is a writer, you see, he was writing

267
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
a story, a love story.

268
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,790
So he asked his wife: “Supposing before 
marriage if I had come and asked you that

269
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,880
you elope with me, what you would do?”

270
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,890
She said: “I will, I would have reported 
to police immediately”.

271
00:29:51,890 --> 00:30:10,830
Ravindranath Tagore writing this story about 
a writer.

272
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:19,070
That’s what it is.

273
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:37,140
You see, so you keep your dignity.

274
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,180
You see the way women expose themselves, run 
after men, then how can we complain there

275
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,170
is rape and all that, I mean we want it as 
if it’s the way we want, as if we want all

276
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,350
this attention of men, dirty attention of 
men.

277
00:30:47,350 --> 00:31:05,460
But Sahaja Yoginis are not like that.

278
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,840
They are dignified.

279
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:22,080
They have their own, they have their own poise 
and they have respect for themselves, because

280
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,570
they are Yoginis.

281
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,660
They have light above their head.

282
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,530
They are special people.

283
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,640
So we have to really de-condition ourself 
a little bit.

284
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,470
Especially the ego part, which is very, very 
developed in the West should be brought down

285
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
by women.

286
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:58,890
I’ll tell you one incident how I brought 
down the ego of a saint once.

287
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:13,990
Once, you know, I went to see some saint who 
was living in a very high mountain.

288
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:33,890
He was an evolved soul, but a man, you see, 
so he had some ego I think in him.

289
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:43,220
So it started raining very heavily and it 
would not stop.

290
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,330
And it was said that this saint could control 
the rain.

291
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:57,220
And he got very upset when I went up there, 
he was just going on like this, like that,

292
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,180
feeling very bad about the whole thing that 
he could not control the rain.

293
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:15,810
So he came later on, when I went and sat down 
I was all drenched, you see.

294
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,350
So he came and he touched My feet, of course 
that he did.

295
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:28,030
But then he said: “Mother why did You not 
allow me to control the rain?

296
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:41,220
Is it that You wanted to control my ego?”

297
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,250
I said: “No, not at all.

298
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,190
I didn’t want to control your ego by any 
chance."

299
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,870
“Then why did You not allow me to stop the 
rain?”

300
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:05,060
So I said: “The problem is like this.

301
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,590
You are a saint and a sanyasi you see and 
you bought a saree for Me and I can’t take

302
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,590
a saree from a sanyasi.

303
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:31,840
But if I get drenched then I can easily take 
the saree."

304
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:40,330
Very sweetly I told him.

305
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:46,320
So he said: “You know I have a saree for 
You."

306
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,470
And he didn’t know what to answer.

307
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,170
Then I told him that: “You regard Me as 
Adishakti, isn’t it."

308
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,340
“Yes, yes,” he said.

309
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,190
“Yes I do.

310
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,190
You have greater powers."

311
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,280
I said: “That’s not the point.

312
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,460
But when I was coming I thought if the rain 
flows over My body then the whole thing will

313
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,160
get vibrated and you will have a very lush 
area here.

314
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,250
That’s why I wanted to do that."

315
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:46,180
And he was completely paralyzed down below, 
you see, but he got hold of My feet and started

316
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,390
crying.

317
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:55,840
He said: “My Mother, please forgive me."

318
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:06,370
See this is what intelligence is and this 
is what intuition is.

319
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,100
All right?

320
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:18,300
So try to develop your intuition and always 
say yes to every thing, but whatever you know

321
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:26,520
will happen.

322
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,330
But we, if we decide:” No this should happen 
like this, it must be like this, it must be

323
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,540
like that”, if you go on like that, you 
see then you will make everybody miserable

324
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:48,100
and you will be miserable.

325
00:36:48,100 --> 00:37:18,250
Now if you have kept the cup like this, then 
you will say no like this.

326
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,250
Then husband will come and put like that.

327
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,250
Then you will keep it like that.

328
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,310
Go on like that, you see.

329
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:36,650
But if you are a real woman you said all right 
keep it like that only, all right, keep it.

330
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:43,390
So immediately all the Ganas will come to 
help you.

331
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:55,520
Either he will spill the whole tea on himself 
or he will break the ear of the cup.

332
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,240
That’s how the Ganas will help you.

333
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,260
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

334
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,500
So you are the Devis.

335
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,700
You see they will all look after you.

336
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,990
If you want to be men, half way and there, 
why should the Ganas be bothered about such

337
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,900
half people?

338
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:25,700
I’ve tried that, many a times I’ve tried 
that [Shri Mataji laughs.]

339
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:34,570
And I’ve seen people, you see, try to show 
off too much and they just don’t know how

340
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,450
they get lost ultimately, you see.

341
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,700
So the main thing is, that you develop your 
intuition and leave it to your intuition and

342
00:38:41,700 --> 00:39:05,920
whatever is your intuition will come true, 
because intuition is coming from the Ganas.

343
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:17,530
So the left side is to be developed in a way 
for Ganas to be pleased.

344
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:31,110
And once you develop the Ganas with you, no 
body can touch you.

345
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:39,320
See today we had gone out and the car was 
kept there, it was all locked.

346
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:53,800
And I had a very expensive sweater and an 
extremely expensive shawl inside the car.

347
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:02,620
And suddenly intuition came into My head and 
I asked them: “Have you really locked the

348
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,730
car properly?”

349
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,400
They said: “Yes."

350
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,619
I said: “Better see."

351
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,940
But they said: “Yes, all right."

352
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:30,940
But, when we went into the car they said: 
“Where is the Radio?”

353
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,200
So Patrick started looking in his pocket you 
see.

354
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,950
They started searching here and there.

355
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,290
I said that: The thief is not going to leave 
it in the car.

356
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,710
He must have taken it away”.

357
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,990
But all My things were intact.

358
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:00,190
Ganas must have beaten them: “Don’t touch 
this."

359
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:16,380
Because these are much more expensive than 
that, but still nobody touched it.

360
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:25,360
And they [men] have many deficiencies, which 
are very interesting, like they always forget

361
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
things.

362
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
Always!

363
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
[Laughter.]

364
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:45,280
Forget, this they will leave there, this they 
will leave there, that they will forget.

365
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,080
You see that’s their specialty.

366
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,530
You give them the key: “Oh you never give 
me the key!” they will say.

367
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,400
“All right.

368
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,840
I never gave you the key, all right?”

369
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,250
So then he- now My husband is very tall.

370
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:15,420
So I see everything above six feet and there 
it is.

371
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,470
So it’s very interesting, isn’t it?

372
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:30,080
So you should be calm and quiet and collected.

373
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:38,040
Collected together.

374
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,510
And then you will see how all the Ganas are 
with you.

375
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:58,530
And after sometime, your husband will be walking 
behind you in every way, in money matters,

376
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,250
in everything.

377
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,190
Right, we had lots of profit in our house, 
you see.

378
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,580
So My husband gave Me some money and kept 
his money very nicely, some sort of a God

379
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:31,850
knows, he said: “We’ll get a big interest 
this that”.

380
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,850
I said: “All right.

381
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,120
It’s all right”.

382
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:44,520
And I bought a house a little, small little 
part of the Hounslow house.

383
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,290
And the house has now achieved the price seven 
times.

384
00:43:50,290 --> 00:44:00,970
And his savings now are not even one fourth 
of what I have.

385
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:11,770
So it’s not even one fourth now his savings 
are.

386
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,340
So now he is saying: “Should I buy a house?

387
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,510
If You say I will buy a house."

388
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:26,210
I said: “Not now, because it’s the highest 
price.

389
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:32,100
It is the highest price now."

390
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:40,150
He said: “How do You know economics?”

391
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,450
“Just intuition."

392
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:51,030
He is an honours of economics and he’s got 
gold medals, imagine!

393
00:44:51,030 --> 00:45:02,640
They are so intelligent that they lack common 
sense and practical sense.

394
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,260
See they have one type of a dress they go 
on wearing it.

395
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
You can change so many times, do this.

396
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,110
They have no time.

397
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:21,770
They are gross people.

398
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:31,330
Common sense they don’t have.

399
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:39,230
So you are a complement to them.

400
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:52,420
They are good at laws and regulations and 
things.

401
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,810
There you must accept what they are saying.

402
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:59,500
And if they say: “Do this and do that” 
you must accept, because they know that part.

403
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:09,650
They are conversant with that part and should 
never argue.

404
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:14,360
You cannot achieve anything after with arguments.

405
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,090
All right?

406
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:21,270
Now this is for one question.

407
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,380
Now which is the other one?

408
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,460
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

409
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,460
All right?

410
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
So everybody seems to be happy now.

411
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:37,800
We have to get the Ganas on our side.

412
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,770
All right?

413
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:52,720
May God bless you.
