1
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,500
Today it's a different day,

2
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:45,289
altogether, for all of you

3
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:50,080
because,

4
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,039
this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

5
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:02,455
And Adi Shakti is the Complete Personality.

6
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
It's not only,

7
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,872
the left side that you know.

8
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,205
You all know only the left side,

9
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:16,663
from Shri Ganesha,

10
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,788
through the ascent,

11
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:27,205
of different different Chakras, on the left side.

12
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:31,538
I didn't want to tell you about the right side,

13
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,580
to begin with,

14
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:39,164
because those who have gone through the right side,

15
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,580
got just lost.

16
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:48,830
They got Gayatri Mantra,

17
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:55,621
from the, writings.

18
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,080
But they didn't know what it was about.

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,913
They just used to learn it by heart.

20
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,455
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

21
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,455
and that is how they moved,

22
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,621
on the right side,

23
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:24,621
and - I dont know - they landed up at the Agnya.

24
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,413
And then they were trying

25
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:32,788
for the Self Realisation.

26
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,913
They were promised

27
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,997
that if you do this right side properly,

28
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,913
you will reach,

29
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:46,039
to the ultimate goal of Self Realisation.

30
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,538
But none of them reached yet.

31
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:53,872
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

32
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:56,455
terrible temper,

33
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,538
of cursing others,

34
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,955
of destroying others,

35
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,039
all these things they learnt,

36
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,289
through their right side movement.

37
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:14,080
There was no Kundalini awakening.

38
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,913
And they were made,

39
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,830
to go up to the,

40
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,872
at the most Agnya Chakra.

41
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:27,122
And then they collapsed into different,

42
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:31,122
places of complete ignorance.

43
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,330
All these books were written,

44
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,621
without understanding,

45
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:47,413
that's not easy to go via right side.

46
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,455
But best was,

47
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,371
to awaken your Kundalini.

48
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,580
The Kundalini directly takes you up

49
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:01,872
- in the center of all the Chakras,

50
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:05,997
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya,

51
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,039
and goes beyond Agnya

52
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,788
into the Sahasrara.

53
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,788
And then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

54
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,496
Now what is so important about the Brahmarandra

55
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,955
from where it pierces?

56
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,496
I never told you about it.

57
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,830
But now I think, for most of you the time has come.

58
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:34,872
You see in the childhood,

59
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,455
the child has a Thalu,

60
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,371
is the fontanel bone area,

61
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,747
which is pulsating always.

62
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,122
It is pulsating,

63
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,872
because the Spirit entered

64
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,997
through that area,

65
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:54,997
and, when you close it,

66
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,913
it settles in the Heart.

67
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,580
Now you have to become,

68
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:06,080
the Spirit orientated person.

69
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:12,872
But how to enter, into the Sahastrara, was the problem.

70
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,997
The tantricas who were there

71
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:19,289
they went through the right-left side [ie left side],

72
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,830
and they developed all the practices,

73
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:29,621
of black, we should say, the left side.

74
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,830
So the right sided became extremely hot tempered,

75
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:41,872
extremely hot tempered I should say extremely ambitious,

76
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:44,039
ferocious,

77
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,413
and they started killing people

78
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:54,289
on the basis of cursing.

79
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,080
They are very good at cursing people,

80
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,580
to be always forward,

81
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,289
push back all the people,

82
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:07,955
and override everybody'ss rights.

83
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,455
They were regarded

84
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,039
as the most, ambitious and most, powerful people.

85
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:18,205
Now the brahmins,

86
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,080
and to some extent the shatriyas,

87
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,247
they took the right side.

88
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,747
Because of the right side,

89
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,455
they became very powerful no doubt.

90
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,289
They got all the powers over the world,

91
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,247
and eh[a/e sound],

92
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,496
they were regarded as extremely,

93
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,913
powerful and majestic people - but they were not.

94
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,747
Because they were so hot tempered.

95
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,955
Hot tempered people cannot be spiritual.

96
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,997
So they were told "you'll get your spirituality

97
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,955
don't worry keep moving, "

98
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:02,580
and the seven, Chakras were described,

99
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:05,371
on the right side.

100
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,496
According to them there is Bhuh,

101
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:13,289
Bhuvah.

102
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:18,164
Bhuh is this, butri[? putri/bhutri/phutri], is this world -Bhuh.

103
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:24,496
Bhurvah is the complete, Cosmos or we can call it Antariksha.

104
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,913
Swaha.

105
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:30,830
Swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra.

106
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,955
And Swadha, is the,

107
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,580
Swadha is the consumption,

108
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,289
inside - is to, absorption.

109
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,455
Swaha, Swadha.

110
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,205
Then is the minya [? meyengya]

111
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,830
-heart.

112
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,455
Manah.

113
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:58,164
After Manah

114
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:07,247
came, the Agnya. The Vishuddi.

115
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:10,330
The Vishuddi is Janah

116
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,663
collectivity, people,

117
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,039
go to the people.

118
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:18,496
Janah.

119
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:23,872
Then, at the Agnya it is Tapah.

120
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,080
In Tapah we have,

121
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:31,330
Christ in the center.

122
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,997
Left side,

123
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,455
they had,

124
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:39,705
Jainism,

125
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,330
right side Christianity.

126
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:48,289
They were not actually ascending path.

127
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:54,580
They were, just side, outlets you can say,

128
00:09:55,247 --> 00:10:00,955
for the energy, of people who were trying, to seek the truth.

129
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:11,122
Now this, happened, for ages in India.

130
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:14,122
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

131
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:18,205
all the big tapaswis, all of them did this.

132
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:20,955
But where did they reach?

133
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,621
Tapaswis were the people,

134
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,371
who could give, curses,

135
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:30,580
kshu - sharp, to people.

136
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,580
They could curse somebody.

137
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:39,164
With the, kathakshay [? sanscrit] is with the glance of the eye

138
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,580
they could kill somebody,

139
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,997
they could burn something,

140
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:47,455
all right sided powers they had.

141
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,455
But with these right sided powers

142
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,663
where did they reach?

143
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:56,663
To Hell I should say in a way - if not,

144
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,496
in the limbo as you call it.

145
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:04,663
There nobody got self realisation.

146
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:10,621
You read, the old books from India,

147
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:15,330
but even otherwise, the Greeks..

148
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,621
And then we had Egyptians.

149
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,455
English.

150
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:28,247
And all kinds of, aggressive people.

151
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,371
Germans.

152
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,538
All of them were aggressive.

153
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,205
Catholics.

154
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
And also, you had Romans.

155
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,913
All of them were aggressive, and were taking,

156
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:51,205
the land and property of other countries.

157
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,080
Extremely aggressive,

158
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:58,371
they believed in the, killing of the people.

159
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,788
Extremely, insulting hot tempered people.

160
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,663
So how to bring them to the normal?

161
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,289
To the Central Path?

162
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:22,955
One side wa[,]s, as i told you Bhuh Bhur,

163
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:28,080
Swaha Swadha, is consumption.

164
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,913
This was done by Guru Principle.

165
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:37,330
Then we have, Mana, Jena [?sp] .

166
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,455
That is collective.

167
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,955
They became collective  no doubt, because-

168
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,663
they are so powerful,

169
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:47,538
that they had such a lot of people - with them.

170
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:53,205
To fight for the, oppressive,

171
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,455
with their oppressive temperament they were,

172
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:59,621
fighting on people and were, oppressing them.

173
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:05,580
All this kind of knara-generation came,

174
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,080
in the history as you know, and then it disappeared.

175
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,705
Wars were created..

176
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:19,122
Then so many people were killed..

177
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:25,705
We had hitler as the maximum, of cruelty.

178
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:30,747
They never cared for humanity.

179
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:35,580
Then ultimately it came, to the Agnya.

180
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:41,580
Agnya also they killed, Jesus Christ.

181
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,788
They destroyed Jesus Christ.

182
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,164
They destroyed so many great saints

183
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,830
who were really saints, through the Central Path.

184
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,663
Some were Incarnations, and they destroyed them.

185
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:05,538
All this happened, since the time of Rama.

186
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,663
All that has happened.

187
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:15,830
And one after another, so many rakshasas came,

188
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:20,538
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world.

189
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,496
Extremely arrogant,

190
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:32,747
show offs as we can call them, very aggressive people.

191
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,788
And this aggression came,

192
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,538
came with such a great force,

193
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,580
and followed one after another.

194
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,872
It went up to a point.

195
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,413
When people reacted,

196
00:14:55,872 --> 00:15:00,164
they were killed, and were destroyed.

197
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:09,455
So horrible people were created.

198
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:23,496
All these people, as they, were,,

199
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:32,413
aggressive and destructive.

200
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,705
This nature is still within us,

201
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,830
some people,

202
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,705
because they are right sided.

203
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,039
All right side people had this problem.

204
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:55,080
Temper, aggression, controlling others,

205
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,747
the growth stopped.

206
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,788
And there was no spiritual growth.

207
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:06,955
They wanted to have, spirituality,

208
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:11,496
but with this kind of,

209
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,455
behaviour they had developed,

210
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,955
spirituality ran away.

211
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,164
We had so many Incarnations.

212
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,580
They all were killed, crucified,

213
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,580
or were finished.

214
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,455
There was no, possibility of saving,

215
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,788
human beings in general.

216
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,330
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

217
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:46,663
We had one Hitler,

218
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,164
who really hit all the people,

219
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,413
all the countries all the nations,

220
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,538
and we were all finished.

221
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,621
All this is because,

222
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:02,872
we have taken to, right sided movement,

223
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,705
which they thought was easier for spirituality which was not.

224
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:11,164
So they crossed all the limits,

225
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,872
and they reached a stage,

226
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,247
that they became,

227
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,788
absolutely devils rakshasas.

228
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:27,205
Without realising, that human beings are rakshasas.

229
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,997
That's what they become.

230
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,955
Even their gurus were like that,

231
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:45,455
and nothing, but they taur-t-tortured, even the Incarnations.

232
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:49,080
All the Incarnations were tortured by them.

233
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:54,580
It was really, how they saved themselves- remarkable.

234
00:17:54,997 --> 00:18:00,705
But ultimately, they couldn't produce any results.

235
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,621
So the first thing I tried was to,

236
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:08,705
study about, the Kundalini.

237
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,830
That I should be able, to raise the Kundalini,

238
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,289
and I knew I had come for that.

239
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,289
Not for anything else,

240
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:21,496
but only to raise the Kundalini of people,

241
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:25,705
so that they take, to the Central Path.

242
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,872
Not to the right, or to the left.

243
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:32,747
But I told you the knowledge of the left side,

244
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,747
plus, raising your Kundalini.

245
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,830
By raising your Kundalini, you broke your Sahastrara.

246
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,830
And you entered into the realm,

247
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,747
of real, Joy

248
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,205
- of Reality.

249
00:18:56,205 --> 00:19:01,496
All these bad qualities, started falling out.

250
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,580
In the Central Path first the Mooladhara came.

251
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:11,371
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the Central Path,

252
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:17,122
you became, very pure people.

253
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,039
Your eyes became Pure,

254
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,747
your licentiousness went away.

255
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,413
Your cheapness went away.

256
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,872
And you became very very,,

257
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:35,747
I think we should call them the Holy people.

258
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:38,705
Unless and until that happens,

259
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,538
you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

260
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:44,580
You cannot be a licentious,

261
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,830
you cannot be a flirtish,

262
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,955
you cannot be a man

263
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:52,788
who wants to, grab money from others and all that,

264
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,955
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

265
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,705
So all such people were thrown out.

266
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:03,413
Once they were thrown out they were showing their,

267
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,413
teeth I should say.

268
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,289
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

269
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,830
But, they understand, now some of them,

270
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:13,122
that we have made mistakes.

271
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,621
So first thing is,

272
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:20,663
that you must develop your, sense of Chastity.

273
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,872
Respect it. And enjoy it.

274
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:30,788
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

275
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:34,621
That's the first Chakra on the left side.

276
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,580
Where you have Shri Ganesha.

277
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,330
But on the right side also we have Deities.

278
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,247
On every Chakra, we have Deities, to compensate.

279
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,289
For Shri Ganesha is in the Center.

280
00:20:55,872 --> 00:21:02,371
And that's how we were blessed, by His powerful, purity.

281
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,247
And we started understanding the beauty of purity,

282
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:09,997
the power of purity.

283
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,580
That's how our right side . . , we finished off.

284
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,289
Right side was for fighting, for killing,

285
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
anger.

286
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:30,747
There was no peace for these people,

287
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:34,955
the only thing they knew how to dominate others,

288
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:37,621
and to be intolerable.

289
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,330
So then they rose, to a higher,

290
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:48,247
higher level of, Swadisthan.

291
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:55,830
In Swadisthana, they rose and the aggressiveness,

292
00:21:56,413 --> 00:22:00,247
of the creative people, to create something.

293
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,455
Even now we have many.

294
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:06,205
They create all kinds of nonsense,

295
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:09,039
create all site of gross text ,

296
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:15,872
also very very, I should say, dirty things,

297
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:18,997
to make a name.

298
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:23,122
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

299
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:27,955
people who wanted to have, a name a position,

300
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:32,413
that came from right Swadisthana.

301
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,580
Then the third Chakra that was there,

302
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:39,997
was the Nabhi Chakra.

303
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:42,330
On the Nabhi Chakra,

304
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,289
they went all out to make money,

305
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,371
not Laxmi, but money.

306
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,788
Money by any means.

307
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,289
And they cheated the whole world.

308
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,371
With this money that they got,

309
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,289
they did all kinds of bad things.

310
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:10,247
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

311
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:19,164
Cheating was very much in the left side countries like India,

312
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:25,080
and aggressiveness in the right side countries.

313
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,164
In the center, what quality we have,

314
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:34,580
at the Swadisthana is the creativeness.

315
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Creative of art,

316
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:40,621
which is very beautiful, which is very deep,

317
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:43,955
which is absolutely spiritual.

318
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,580
That vanished.

319
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,580
And people started showing even the Incarnations

320
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,205
full of dirty habits.

321
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:58,205
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

322
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,247
Then as you- I told you there's Nabhi.

323
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:09,039
In Nabhi people,, got after money.

324
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:15,247
Left sided people were making money,

325
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,205
right sided, were aggressive with their money.

326
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,830
If they were earning, they thought they were on top of the world.

327
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:23,663
If they had money,

328
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,830
they thought nobody's better then us.

329
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:30,496
All this, finished them off.

330
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:33,164
It's finishing.

331
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:36,955
It will come to that point where they will realise,

332
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:40,830
that money is, not for destroying,

333
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:42,205
but for construction.

334
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:44,788
Constructing of the country

335
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,455
- constructing of the human beings together,

336
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:50,080
to bring peace and love among them.

337
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,247
For helping,

338
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:57,247
for doing all kinds of good things.

339
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,455
Then the same right sided people,

340
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:04,496
were,,

341
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,496
to the Chakra of the Mother.

342
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,955
Hah...and they were horrible mothers.

343
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,580
Tried to dominate their children,

344
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:19,413
dominate everyone,

345
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:24,330
and, could not sacrifice anything for their children.

346
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:28,289
We have had enough of these women,

347
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:31,455
who are aggressive with their husbands,

348
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,872
are aggressive with their children.

349
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:38,830
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

350
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,830
All that kind of lot,

351
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,371
when I came on this Earth I saw,

352
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:47,080
and I was shocked.

353
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,747
What sort of human beings are those?

354
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,371
What am I going to do with them?

355
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:55,830
How will I awaken their Kundalini?

356
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,496
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost.

357
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,247
But now it is the Mother's Chakra.

358
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:06,538
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood,

359
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:08,913
they drove out their children,

360
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,955
very selfish, self centered, dominating parents.

361
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,247
This was . . the Heart Chakra.

362
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,538
Then came the collective Chakra,

363
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,788
what we call as the Vishuddi.

364
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:32,205
At the Vishuddi Chakra,

365
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:35,580
they wanted to occupy the whole world.

366
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:40,413
They wanted to, occupy,

367
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,997
the whole world as their own,

368
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,580
to become emperors,

369
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,080
and they formed empires,

370
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,080
and misbehaved to such an extent,

371
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,330
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

372
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,788
They really were rakshasas I should say,

373
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,913
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

374
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:02,580
In their behaviour, in everything,

375
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,621
you can see how they behave,

376
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,496
towards people, treating them, like that.

377
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:16,580
Creating, people who are, against spirituality,

378
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:19,955
and those who are aggressive.

379
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,955
Well these became like a, to-two sided,

380
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:31,080
world where there are people who are, aggressive,

381
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,496
and the people who are tortured.

382
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:39,164
This two sided world, existed,

383
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:43,289
even now, but is much less.

384
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,496
Thanks to the collective understanding,

385
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:53,872
there are many good institution that were established,

386
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,872
but they are not working out.

387
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,538
They are not so successful.

388
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,663
Because the men at the head of it, are controlling,

389
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:04,663
but controlling what?

390
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,164
Not themselves.

391
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,080
Controlling others.

392
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,872
And all their behaviour has spoilt,

393
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,663
all the work of this Chakra.

394
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:19,289
Collectively, you have, if you see around now today,

395
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:23,747
everywhere theresss, war going on,

396
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:26,496
fights going on, killing going on,

397
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,164
destruction going on.

398
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:32,330
How is it?

399
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:33,913
There are so many,

400
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,247
spiritual people in now on this world.

401
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:39,455
So the reason is,

402
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:42,455
the spiritual people have become very quiet.

403
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:45,997
Very much enjoying their, spiritual life.

404
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:51,997
Have become very quiet and very, ... , peaceful people.

405
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:55,080
But that doesn't bring peace!

406
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:58,371
You have to be dynamic!

407
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,413
And you have to bring peace in the world,

408
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,413
you have to do something about it.

409
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:06,580
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

410
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,371
but we are not bothered as to see,

411
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,955
what it the progress others have done.

412
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:13,955
How far they have gone.

413
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:15,663
Where can we meet them.

414
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:17,663
What can we change them.

415
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:20,164
At my level I can change many things,

416
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:23,496
but at your level how many people have you changed?

417
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:25,496
What have you done?

418
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:27,247
That has to be seen.

419
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:31,455
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya.

420
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,538
And, you are very happy with your peace,

421
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:38,663
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

422
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:42,830
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today.

423
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,538
That those who are also spiritual,

424
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,997
those who have achieved great heights,

425
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:49,663
are least bothered!

426
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,955
As to what good has to be done.

427
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:56,164
What the are doing is to enjoy their own - spirituality,

428
00:29:56,788 --> 00:30:00,247
come to the Puja have more, and more, of it.

429
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:06,788
But, they have done, no collective work to change people.

430
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:09,705
Some of them are working one or two, bas [hindi: stop],

431
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:12,580
the rest of them are having a good time,

432
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:16,205
enjoying themselves, in such a manner,

433
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:19,997
that people accept them at great souls

434
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:23,164
good people, that's all.

435
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,997
I would like you to now introspect,

436
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:27,247
and find out,

437
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:29,580
how much collective work you have done,

438
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,997
how many people you have got, like that.

439
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:36,496
With whom are you, talking?

440
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,747
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

441
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,496
Only so many are there.

442
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:45,289
Christ had only 12 disciples,

443
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,955
they are much more dynamic then you are!

444
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:50,955
So now you should take to the right side.

445
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,371
And when you take to the right side,

446
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,371
we'll create dynamic people.

447
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,788
Not just, some useless,

448
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:04,830
patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

449
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:07,413
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

450
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:10,955
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change.

451
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,955
Change so many.

452
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,039
And those who are doing that, all my blessings are with them.

453
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:19,830
But those who are just keeping to themselves,

454
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,247
it is not a very good thing.

455
00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:23,538
In your country

456
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,330
how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

457
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,455
Just find out.

458
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:30,247
With how many people you have worked it out?

459
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,872
So yours is not a complete Yoga.

460
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,455
Yours is a partial Yoga, of the left side where,

461
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:39,289
you are very loving very kind very this thing.

462
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,330
I'm not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

463
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:45,621
But even, I have seen people want to be leaders,

464
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,122
they want to be something great,

465
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,413
but how many people have they given realisation?

466
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:55,164
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

467
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,621
I have seven [see even] in the Aeroplane also you go,

468
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,496
you walk in the street anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

469
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,289
But here we are,

470
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:07,289
using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

471
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,205
for our, understanding of ourselves.

472
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:15,913
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

473
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,371
It has been brought to you

474
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,830
for giving realisations to many people.

475
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:26,747
I request all the younger people, younger generation,

476
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:29,247
not to waste their Sahaj energies,

477
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:32,039
on nonsense as the old people have done.

478
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:35,663
You better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yoga,

479
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,663
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

480
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
They are more interested in running schools,

481
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,455
in looking after the destitute, doing this doing that

482
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45,997
that's not your job.

483
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:49,455
Your job is to create more Sahaja Yogis.

484
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:51,080
More Sahaja Yoginis.

485
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,413
But that is not there,

486
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:55,830
what I find is it's not there.

487
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,830
The right side is missing.

488
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:00,039
You should come to the right side.

489
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,538
Go all ahead.

490
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,830
Nothing will happen to you.

491
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,164
Nobody can kill you,

492
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,289
nobody can disturb you,

493
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:10,621
nobody can arrest you, take it from me.

494
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:12,289
You have powers,

495
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,247
but if you don't use them, you are like this.

496
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:20,913
That is why we have come to the stagnated point.

497
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:24,663
That we should know we have to use our right side.

498
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,788
Right side is very important.

499
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:31,122
Next time I'll tell you about right side,

500
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,788
what right sided things you have,

501
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,663
now you cannot become left sided

502
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:35,913
whatever you may try.

503
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,663
So you use your right side in the right direction,

504
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:43,164
with the right understanding.

505
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,747
Not as, some sort,

506
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,371
I should say, very,

507
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:55,080
arbitrary, or very dominating, like Hitlers.

508
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:58,663
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja Yogis.

509
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,705
But now, the time has come for you,

510
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:06,289
to do something more then what the saints have done before.

511
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:08,122
To work it out that way.

512
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,913
Not to keep to yourself,

513
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:12,205
that, you have a family,

514
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:14,205
you have very nice children,

515
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,621
having, enjoying, all that

516
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,621
- that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

517
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:23,747
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

518
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,122
You have to think about it.

519
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,039
What are you doing, where are you?

520
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,705
And what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

521
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:38,872
Then we come to the, Agnya.

522
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,413
In Agnya, what has happened is Sahaja Yogis

523
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:45,580
are become, they have,

524
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:49,080
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything,

525
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,830
that's not we want.

526
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:56,164
What we want to remove the sufferings of others,

527
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:58,788
remove the aggression of others.

528
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:03,538
So we don't, that kind of organisation we don't have.

529
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,788
That kind of understanding we dont have.

530
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,705
And if that works out, you will be different people.

531
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,371
So we have become like,

532
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:18,788
saints you see sitting in their herm-hermit

533
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:20,705
halls something like that.

534
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,538
Not more then that.
So better try, to do something, positive,

535
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,247
without aggression.

536
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:32,705
I know some of you are still very aggressive.

537
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:36,122
Are show offs I know that.

538
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:44,663
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

539
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,538
then you will realise what, mistakes you have.

540
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:54,247
Still what is lacking in your personality.

541
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:56,747
That is very important.

542
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:01,205
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja Yogis falter.

543
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,580
I don't know what happens to them.

544
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,913
At Agnya, I have told that you must forgive.

545
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,872
But that doesn't mean

546
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,747
that you allow people to do wrong things.

547
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,122
Because you want to forgive it's very easy,

548
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,164
not to fight not to say anything,

549
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:21,830
just keep out just forgive, no!

550
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,080
You go and talk to that person

551
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:30,122
and tell him it is wrong.

552
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,705
You have to face it.

553
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:38,289
If you cannot face it then you are useless.

554
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,080
Just like any other people.

555
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:44,538
What's the use of you people getting your realisation?

556
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,788
So now, we have to understand,

557
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:52,788
that's it's not only that we have vibrations,

558
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,496
that we are alright,

559
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:58,997
that you can cure some people,is the last word -no.

560
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:00,955
You have to spread it.

561
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,538
You have to go in the public. You have to be collective,

562
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:07,205
on this point and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

563
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:09,747
With so many Sahaja Yogis all over the world

564
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,788
we have not progressed much.

565
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,289
So now - it is - you have to plan.

566
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,039
What you want to do,

567
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:20,747
how you want to do it,

568
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:22,955
and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

569
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,872
It's very important.

570
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:32,289
Because, you people are, good at,

571
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:35,913
say, talking about Sahaja Yoga, singing about Sahaja Yoga,

572
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:38,080
all these things are useless

573
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,080
unless and until you have concrete proof,

574
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:44,413
of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

575
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,080
In a small country like Turkey,

576
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,955
we have 25,000 Sahaja Yogis what do you say?

577
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,371
They are all Muslims.

578
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,289
Twenty five thousands Muslims,

579
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,621
becoming Sahaja Yogis.

580
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:05,496
Why, you find that number is very small in any other country?

581
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:12,788
They are not very rich, but they care for their self realisation,

582
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,955
and for too are giving self realisations to others.

583
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,830
It's very surprising, how it has worked out,

584
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,830
how it has spread.

585
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:26,164
So instead of thinking of your problems,

586
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,997
of your enemies,

587
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:33,330
of your powers, think of giving power to others.

588
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:37,455
And making them Sahaja Yoga. It's very important.

589
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:42,039
If you are in Sahastrara, then you have all the powers.

590
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,621
In Sahastrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

591
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,039
what's the use of getting realisation?

592
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:52,663
Just for yourself? It's being very selfish.

593
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,080
So I would say that, instead of spreading your own glory,

594
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:01,997
your own grim, your own, ... name

595
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:06,455
please, try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

596
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,788
Go into a very dynamic force.

597
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:12,788
So many people have complained to me

598
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:16,122
that Sahaja Yogis are nothing but dead people.

599
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,205
Is that what you are?

600
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:25,872
Only single person like me has done so much work.

601
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,955
So why not you people?

602
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,496
In your country have you worked it out, all over?

603
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,997
Just think about it.

604
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,164
And that's why, unless and until

605
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:39,913
you don't do it you are not sampoorna, you are not complete,

606
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,621
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood,

607
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,164
in it's full form.

608
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:47,788
That's why I'm telling you today,

609
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:49,788
it's a very important day that

610
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:51,788
you worship me as Adi Shakti.

611
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:52,872
But you should know that

612
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,496
Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

613
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,496
It cannot be only half left sided - no.

614
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:03,788
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

615
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:08,205
It's like any other getting any other, realisation.

616
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:10,872
That's not so important.

617
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,496
Not only that you should spread,

618
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,580
but also you should make them,

619
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,580
and realise it.

620
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:27,872
All my Blessings, all my Love,

621
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,496
all my Powers I give you.

622
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,122
But try to understand.

623
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,455
Alright?

624
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:38,663
Thank you very much.
