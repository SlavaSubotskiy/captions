Diwali Puja Talk. Istanbul (Turkey)
November 5, 1994.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:16,442
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,

3
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:21,795
which means the rows of lights

4
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:26,142
 or, you can say, group of lights.

5
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,830
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;

6
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,595
it's all right.

7
00:00:53,068 --> 00:01:03,907
This Diwali has been a festival of
very ancient times in India.

8
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:26,502
I already told in My previous lectures
 what are these five days are.

9
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:59,668
After killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

10
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:06,804
when it was the darkest night of the year.

11
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:27,880
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times,

12
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:53,314
 because the worst time,  as far as morality’s
concerned

13
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:58,091
 has been in these modern times.

14
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:21,099
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga.

15
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,526
Ghor Kali Yuga

16
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,291
Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst modern times

17
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:51,312
 That means a complete darkness

18
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,758
and, as you see around, you’ll find out

19
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,313
that there is complete darkness

20
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,846
 as far as morality is concerned,

21
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:30,842
but that’s why there are all kinds of crises.

22
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:57,871
Because of that, also,

23
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:02,801
there are many who are seeking the light, the truth.

24
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,857
In the darkness of ignorance,

25
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:29,381
people have no knowledge as to what

26
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:35,172
they should do, why or they are on this Earth.

27
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:58,785
As you know very well, that thousands
and thousands of real seekers

28
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,622
who are born at this time,

29
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:20,871
that is why this job was given to Me

30
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:28,554
is to create Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance.

31
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:55,228
It’s not an easy job because, on one side,

32
00:06:55,368 --> 00:07:01,099
we have all the dark forces acting against the truth.

33
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:30,812
Also, on the other side, we have to fight the false people

34
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:36,547
who are taking advantage of your seeking.

35
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:02,582
Firstly, people don’t know what to seek,

36
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:15,700
so all these false people have been money-oriented

37
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:22,738
and they tried to work out
marketing of their falsehood

38
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,639
and they have the expertise to do it.

39
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,319
Somebody asked Me [UNCLEAR], television ....

40
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:11,269
what about the cults that are killing people and doing

41
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:16,645
all sorts of things that they did in Switzerland.

42
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:43,362
So I said it’s true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals

43
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,896
who call themselves as spiritual,

44
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:52,530
but the mistake lies with the people who follow.

45
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:23,468
So a person who is absolutely immoral,

46
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:27,446
absolutely dishonest,

47
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:31,805
who launders money to Swiss banks,

48
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:35,219
cannot be a guru.

49
00:10:53,346 --> 00:11:00,118
He used to buy these drugs and sell them.

50
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,774
He used to buy weapons and sell them.

51
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,600
He was worse than his disciples,
much worse.

52
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:50,561
They have used a kind of a suggestion

53
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:54,240
from the books of so-called Guru Gita or something

54
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:59,269
where it is said you should surrender
 everything to your guru.

55
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:31,707
That means it was to suggest
 that a disciple should be willing

56
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:35,664
 to surrender everything to the guru.

57
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:58,919
So, it was for the disciple,

58
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:02,227
but for the guru,
he should not grab anything,

59
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:06,195
he shouldn’t ask for anything,
 he should not be greedy.

60
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:09,541
All these things are already written down.

61
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,375
But nobody reads what is required of a guru

62
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,655
and only they see that

63
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,294
you have to surrender everything to the guru.

64
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,114
Why I’m telling you all this,

65
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:23,903
because how the darkness is
so deep and so dangerous.

66
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,145
Moreover, the other day I read an article

67
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,792
who said that in Milan

68
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:58,471
there is a very, very organisation,

69
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:02,657
a global organisation of Satanism.

70
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:28,869
Many politicians and many people in the government,

71
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,951
very highly placed ministers,
prime ministers are involved in it.

72
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:08,439
Many people who are bank managers
or bank owners

73
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,339
and also the people who call
themselves social workers

74
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:41,828
and also those who have got peace
 award and this award, that award.

75
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:10,439
So this is what is the worst times
of Kali Yuga, modern times.

76
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:29,489
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day,

77
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:37,440
is where a brother and sisters
 celebrate together

78
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,890
 for relationship which is
so pure and so protective.

79
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:13,378
That is to show that, after putting the lights,

80
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:21,104
morality must be the first
 priority for the society.

81
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,468
I need not tell you today

82
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:54,187
immoral side of modern times. It’s horrible.

83
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:21,349
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern times

84
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:25,561
where people do not know
how they relate to each other

85
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:57,653
for which, as I told you before,
Christ has suggested

86
00:19:57,678 --> 00:20:00,251
that you take out the eyes of a man

87
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:03,094
who looks at a woman twice

88
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:59,128
because He found, at that time, people were horrid.

89
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:17,292
Who can follow Christ in these modern times?

90
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,795
Both the eyes, both the hands will be cut off.

91
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,966
On the whole, if you see,

92
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:52,564
I haven’t seen any Christian like that, so far.

93
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:27,707
Mohammed-sahib was even more strict.

94
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:30,997
He thought nothing has been done for the women,

95
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,428
so he passed through some regulations about women also.

96
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:17,830
So he said that any woman who looks
 at a man with bad eyes

97
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:23,287
should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning.

98
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:50,293
I don’t know what would have happened
 to the American ladies

99
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,439
 if they have follow this.

100
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,372
So when I came to this Earth

101
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:19,075
I discovered that these two are
 very difficult, specially in Kali Yuga.

102
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,509
These laws are actually meant

103
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,594
for not normal human beings,
 but for angels.

104
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:23,510
So modern man is even worse
than a normal human being

105
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:46,239
because they want something destructive all the time,

106
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:50,348
like the Spanish ask the bull to hit them.

107
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:03,766
Now the description of modern times

108
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:13,478
is there to show you in
what times we are living

109
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:38,220
and I realised this not an easy thing

110
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:42,286
to talk to them about anything

111
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:47,243
that is good without giving them realisation.

112
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:13,677
Unless and until you give them realisation,

113
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:18,052
nothing can penetrate into their minds

114
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,320
on just mental level.

115
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:54,059
And also giving only lectures and sermons,

116
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:57,420
the whole thing will be at a mental level only.

117
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:24,003
And also the religions which are so-called

118
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:30,192
are really very harmful for
the spiritual growth of human beings.

119
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:59,548
I felt that enlightenment is the only way

120
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:02,072
one can save this world.

121
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,888
In this darkness of ignorance,

122
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:29,711
the darkest night of the whole history of this world,

123
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:38,888
we needed light and lights, many lights.

124
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,239
Agni,

125
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,421
You to say sanskrit

126
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,805
Yes, Agni means fire in Sanskrit language.

127
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,090
All right.

128
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:41,205
So the world divided into so many countries,

129
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:48,246
so many races, so many languages

130
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:52,950
and also their own thinking -

131
00:31:55,177 --> 00:32:01,165
think of a global religion

132
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:06,567
was only possible when people got their realisation.

133
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:06,224
So, I had to tell you, human beings,

134
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:10,028
what are their problems.

135
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:28,430
So, in a light, in India,

136
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,596
we have the pot or the container
which is made of clay,

137
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,933
then the oil, and then the wick.

138
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:16,051
Now, this body, this mind,

139
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:22,066
you can call all that is visible

140
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:27,055
and is within, is all the pot

141
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:55,093
and the oil is the compassion, the love

142
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:11,943
and the wick is the Kundalini,
the pure desire,

143
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,114
and the spark is the spirit.

144
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:14,914
So, first of all, the container has to be all right.

145
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,133
It should be all right.

146
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:37,424
It should be able to contain the oil properly

147
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:42,157
and should not allow it to ooze out.

148
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:08,383
Now there are two holes that cause problem.

149
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:13,656
One is your ego.
 Another is your conditionings.

150
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:46,226
So, if a Sahaja Yogi

151
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:50,992
thinks of his conditionings,

152
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:55,520
that “I am a Christian or, you can say,

153
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,190
that I come from this race,
I’m this community,”

154
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:06,300
so all these limitations with
which we have built ourselves

155
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:11,026
are so flimsy that they break out

156
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,354
because there is no reality in them.

157
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:04,123
There’s no substance so they fizzle out.

158
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:36,592
They all act like possessions

159
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:40,326
 and a person becomes absolutely blind.

160
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:13,164
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,
I’ve seen Christians will adhere to Christ,

161
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:18,320
Muslims will adhere to Mohammed-sahib or to Ali

162
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:25,637
and others will adhere to the conditionings
 from which they have come,

163
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:11,195
but they don’t adhere to Me,

164
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:17,110
so they cannot see the integration of
 all these personalities in one person.

165
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:52,748
One has to know, on this point,

166
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:56,933
that you have got the light.

167
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,193
You are enlightened.

168
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:23,053
You are not an egg.
You have become a bird.

169
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:38,815
So you have to give up all that is falsehood.

170
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:06,354
If you are fully enlightened you will give up
automatically, you don’t have to be told.

171
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:32,160
When the light is enlightened,

172
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:36,131
it automatically feel responsible

173
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:39,070
that it has to give light.

174
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:07,555
Nobody has to tell that
“You please give light”

175
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,826
 because it is light.

176
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:34,911
Because it is eternal light,
nothing can kill it.

177
00:44:57,326 --> 00:45:00,035
I will say a Sanskrit Shloka,

178
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,495
Nainam chidanti sashtrani
 Nainam dahanti pavaka

179
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:08,793
Chayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha

180
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:14,446
means it cannot be killed by [UNCLEAR],

181
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,929
not air can blow it away,

182
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,916
 nothing can destroy it.

183
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:31,590
Even if you want to suck it, you cannot.

184
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:36,195
It’s such a powerful light you have got within yourself.

185
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:25,662
You can verify whether it is eternal or not.

186
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:40,178
You should introspect and see for yourself.

187
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:45,745
You’ve got such a unique light within you.

188
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:17,414
Not in the history of this world of spirituality

189
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:24,452
so many have got realisation,
such light within them..

190
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:58,616
So how could these stupid, flimsy,

191
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,500
useless conditionings

192
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:07,483
dominate you now when you are
 the carrier of eternal light?

193
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:42,830
But if you don’t respect this eternal light,

194
00:48:42,862 --> 00:48:45,984
then the conditionings will put it out.

195
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:06,546
This is the only problem,

196
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,937
that you have the freedom.

197
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,077
You want to have the eternal light, you’ll have it,

198
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:18,747
otherwise this light can be damaged completely.

199
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:53,020
So, the another hole is that of ego.

200
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:15,329
One side, conditioning can be resolved
by the sense of responsibility.

201
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:37,854
The same sense of responsibility,

202
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:43,232
when asserted through ego,
could be very dangerous.

203
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,424
This light can become fire

204
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:26,953
and it can burn the house of Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:56,110
A normal life, we know
 that light is for giving us light,

206
00:51:56,337 --> 00:51:58,592
not for burning houses,

207
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:23,441
but when you get to ego in Sahaja Yoga,

208
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:28,105
you can think that you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

209
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,800
but this responsibility

210
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:05,638
should not give you an idea
 that you are in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

211
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:32,354
So, gradually then, you become so right-sided

212
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,874
and people are surprised that how

213
00:53:35,884 --> 00:53:41,323
this man who was normal has become
 like a bull in the china shop.

214
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:45,790
bull in the china shop

215
00:53:47,813 --> 00:53:50,908
bull in the china shop.

216
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,733
English phrase.

217
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,778
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

218
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:03,879
It’s like government servants.

219
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:08,102
They are suppose to be servants,
 but they are the bosses.

220
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:28,889
They become bosses.

221
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:47,543
So, the whole understanding

222
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,476
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yoga.

223
00:56:20,456 --> 00:56:24,963
The second part is the oil,

224
00:56:39,872 --> 00:56:41,839
which is compassion,

225
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:55,764
which is natural, innate and joy-giving.

226
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,577
This oil has to be pure.

227
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,232
The compassion has to be pure.

228
00:57:28,675 --> 00:57:36,000
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis
try to trouble the leaders.

229
00:57:51,932 --> 00:57:57,750
They oppose the leader and try to hinder
the work of Sahaja Yoga.

230
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:18,852
Now, these are suppose to be Sahaja Yogis

231
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:25,294
and they don’t understand if their compassion is pure

232
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:27,981
they will appreciate their leader

233
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:32,229
because the leader is doing such a compassionate work.

234
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:14,348
Of course, pure compassion, one must understand,

235
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:17,422
has nothing to do with greed,

236
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:20,495
with temptations, nothing to do.

237
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:46,477
One has to feel such nearness

238
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,956
with the leader and appreciativeness of the work

239
00:59:50,996 --> 00:59:54,603
 he or she is putting in.

240
01:00:12,562 --> 01:00:15,419
So Compassion cannot be impure.

241
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:18,858
There cannot be lust in it.

242
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:45,147
More over this compassion should be
express in such a descent

243
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:49,587
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

244
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:17,707
Thank God, this one good thing has happened,

245
01:01:17,732 --> 01:01:21,264
people don’t kiss you.

246
01:01:42,108 --> 01:01:47,539
First time when I went to western countries,

247
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:53,910
I was just bombarded with kisses.
 I didn’t know what to say — I mean horrible.

248
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:22,291
There may not be anything wrong in the mind,

249
01:02:22,315 --> 01:02:26,849
but it’s so indecent and stupid.

250
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:58,860
Long time back

251
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:02,356
I was told that it was written on Indian airports,

252
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:05,926
 “Please don’t kiss the custom officers.”

253
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:42,525
In modern times a man can kiss a woman,

254
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:46,149
but he can’t kiss a man.
 I mean, it’s absurd.

255
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:24,593
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

256
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:32,230
now they don’t hug, poor things,
they just touch with hands, each other….

257
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,684
they make a goal

258
01:04:34,957 --> 01:04:38,711
 they don’t even hug each other....

259
01:05:08,788 --> 01:05:13,606
So, and now I’ve seen many people who make a goal

260
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:15,791
and they’re excited, so they run out of the field.

261
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:17,386
They don’t know what to do.

262
01:06:06,515 --> 01:06:09,853
So, for Sahaja Yogis,

263
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:13,670
you should know men can kiss men
 and can hug them

264
01:06:13,695 --> 01:06:14,695
there’s nothing wrong

265
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,054
and same with the ladies.

266
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:55,625
Otherwise, in excitement, they might
 run out of the field of Sahaja Yoga.

267
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,173
Men need not touch women, 
women not touch men. It’s all right.

268
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,319
What is this nonsense?
 You can’t express your love?

269
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:57,602
Say for India we have a rule that 
a lady can touch the younger man

270
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,427
and a man can touch a much older women,

271
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:06,584
who could be a mother, sister-in-law, anyone,

272
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:42,234
which I think is a good rule because it has worked out.

273
01:09:00,884 --> 01:09:03,130
So, for compassion,

274
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:10,007
it has to have decency as fragrance in the oil.

275
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:39,866
So how do we express our compassion?

276
01:09:49,697 --> 01:09:53,292
We have Rakhi sisters, Rakhi brothers,

277
01:10:04,555 --> 01:10:06,862
but I know of a lady

278
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:12,008
who became friendly with 
rich boys as Rakhi brothers.

279
01:10:41,188 --> 01:10:45,060
Or the other way round also, that

280
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,818
many boys became Rakhi sisters of rich women.

281
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:20,106
So one has to understand that
 it is not for money that

282
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:24,441
you should become Rakhi brothers 
and sisters and to exploit,

283
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:27,453
but for compassion.

284
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:05,303
You have to express your Rakhi relationship

285
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:08,608
just for the protection of each other.

286
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,557
The compassion is so joy-giving

287
01:12:33,565 --> 01:12:37,781
that you should have not such conditions of money

288
01:12:37,806 --> 01:12:43,938
or any other stupid conditions which will kill your joy.

289
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:19,318
But another thing also is that

290
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:26,443
you express your love you use 
some things as presents

291
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:30,144
that gives you joy.

292
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,967
That doesn’t mean, by any chance,

293
01:14:04,057 --> 01:14:07,899
that you just give it to your Rakhi sister

294
01:14:07,934 --> 01:14:11,005
and not even to your wife, some present.

295
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:36,247
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion has to rise

296
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:42,556
 in the plant, giving love to different parts,

297
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:45,488
indifferent ways, whatever is required

298
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:49,681
and that then evaporates

299
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:53,391
or goes back resource.

300
01:15:21,703 --> 01:15:29,189
Attachment is the killer 
of pure love and compassion.

301
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:51,007
So try to always find out, introspect.

302
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,178
Are you attached  to your children, to your wife

303
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:59,078
or to your Rakhi sister or to anything? 
Attached?

304
01:15:59,552 --> 01:16:03,212
Then there’s a danger that

305
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:07,492
you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

306
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:55,512
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely detached

307
01:16:55,854 --> 01:17:04,825
and nourishing the different relationships 
that you have in a proper way,

308
01:17:05,325 --> 01:17:07,962
your joy is perfect.

309
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:44,365
Ambition is another killer of joy.

310
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:02,718
So, if you have to be ambitious,

311
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:05,881
you have to be only ambitious only about Sahaja Yoga,

312
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,431
so that you humble down.

313
01:18:44,044 --> 01:18:52,310
One promise in Sahaja Yoga is 
that your life will be full of joy.

314
01:19:16,959 --> 01:19:22,294
There is no need to take out your eyes, 
cut your hands, no punishments.

315
01:19:38,825 --> 01:19:44,099
If you have too many holes, 
need not come to Sahaj Yoga.

316
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:03,774
You have to become real holy person, 
not full of holes.

317
01:20:22,052 --> 01:20:26,409
I must say that you are all “your holinesses.”

318
01:20:42,574 --> 01:20:46,582
I am not because I’ve not become. 
You have become.

319
01:20:55,929 --> 01:21:00,497
Supposing, somebody has to call you 
as a man, will they say,

320
01:21:00,513 --> 01:21:06,191
 “Oh, man, such and such”?
 No, because you are a man.

321
01:21:36,404 --> 01:21:42,072
Whatever you achieve is attached to you,
 whatever you have achieved.

322
01:22:04,179 --> 01:22:07,848
Russian seems to be long translation

323
01:22:11,812 --> 01:22:14,976
and sometimes very small

324
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:20,946
and sometimes Romanian sometimes very short, 
sometimes very long.

325
01:22:32,717 --> 01:22:40,977
All right, so now the another thing 
that is promised is bliss.

326
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:05,739
What is bliss is the experience of joy.

327
01:23:13,808 --> 01:23:16,609
It can come from anything.

328
01:23:33,838 --> 01:23:42,347
Maybe you find you were in an accident 
and you were suddenly saved, protected.

329
01:23:42,507 --> 01:23:45,959
You are amazed and everybody feels the bliss.

330
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,371
You also feel the bliss.

331
01:24:42,726 --> 01:24:45,519
To be very frank, I cannot translate.

332
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:51,849
I know languages, but from one language
 to another, I cannot translate.

333
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:54,664
There’s something wrong with Me.

334
01:24:55,461 --> 01:25:00,280
Yogi: “But you understand very well, 
Shri Mataji, what we say.”

335
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:17,657
That is very easy.

336
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:21,913
See the thoughts, first is an abstract form.

337
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,496
That’s an abstract form,

338
01:25:39,504 --> 01:25:42,101
that’s all I said.

339
01:26:24,377 --> 01:26:28,845
All right, but thank you very much.

340
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:35,296
So, it is — you see, at that point

341
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,244
anybody can know what is the thought is

342
01:26:40,269 --> 01:26:45,616
because later on it becomes a language, takes words.

343
01:27:20,955 --> 01:27:26,058
All right, so if you can jump at that abstract,

344
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:30,841
then you know that, but you have to 
put attention quite a lot.

345
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:11,162
So, you have to pay attention 
"to that abstract point to continuous"

346
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:31,392
All right, so now, to solve this problem,

347
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:35,347
I would request you all, to learn,
 at least, English language.

348
01:28:45,686 --> 01:28:49,638
I’m not saying Sanskrit, but English.

349
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:15,937
Now, it is the Kundalini,

350
01:29:16,001 --> 01:29:18,193
which is a pure desire,

351
01:29:18,202 --> 01:29:22,769
is already existing, 
you don’t have to do anything.

352
01:29:43,454 --> 01:29:47,556
Maybe the cotton is not clean.

353
01:29:47,561 --> 01:29:51,021
It has some problems

354
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:57,709
because it has passed through dirty hands,

355
01:29:57,775 --> 01:30:01,935
but it can be clean.

356
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:06,440
The cotton [UNCLEAR]

357
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,448
may not be clean

358
01:30:08,473 --> 01:30:11,052
but it can be clean

359
01:30:18,273 --> 01:30:20,391
Cotton wool, I mean.

360
01:30:49,191 --> 01:30:53,234
Kabira has said something very beautiful about it.

361
01:31:04,703 --> 01:31:11,053
He says that when the intestine

362
01:31:11,205 --> 01:31:15,949
of a goat are inside the stomach,

363
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:21,620
they say, “May, may, may,” means “I, I, I.”

364
01:31:51,942 --> 01:31:57,355
But when they are pulled out and arevmade into strings

365
01:32:25,818 --> 01:32:34,497
and put on an instrument for 
cleaning the cotton wool —

366
01:32:35,709 --> 01:32:40,348
put on the instrument that cleans the cotton wool.

367
01:32:40,374 --> 01:32:43,913
You know, in India we call it dhunakt ,dhunki.

368
01:33:18,016 --> 01:33:23,295
And when it is being strung, it  says, “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi,”

369
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,315
means  “You, you are, you are, you are.”

370
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:33,578
All right, whatever it is.

371
01:34:33,706 --> 01:34:43,445
So, it means that when your Kundalini 
not working out well

372
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:48,114
because there are problems in your chakras,

373
01:34:48,139 --> 01:34:53,607
what you have to say,
 “You are, you are.” You say that.

374
01:34:53,631 --> 01:34:57,604
 “You are Sakshat this. 
You are Sakshat that.”

375
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:35,683
Sakshat means “in reality.” In reality.

376
01:35:54,046 --> 01:35:57,237
You don’t say, “You are Her Holiness something.”

377
01:35:57,294 --> 01:36:02,014
You say, “You are Ganesha. You are this.”

378
01:36:24,768 --> 01:36:29,924
That is how you cleanse all the dirt

379
01:36:30,012 --> 01:36:36,320
or all the problems of your chakras.

380
01:36:53,786 --> 01:37:00,350
By this, you also correct 
your conditionings and your ego.

381
01:37:16,078 --> 01:37:20,498
Then you do not take the credit for anything.

382
01:37:20,598 --> 01:37:23,700
You do not feel you are doing something

383
01:37:42,871 --> 01:37:48,616
and the whole personality changes

384
01:37:48,641 --> 01:37:55,101
into a complete instrument like the flute

385
01:37:55,126 --> 01:37:59,087
in the hands of Shri Krishna.

386
01:38:24,349 --> 01:38:26,896
Then you see your work,

387
01:38:26,936 --> 01:38:32,091
everything as the work of the Divine.

388
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:58,673
That is how you become enlightened.

389
01:39:05,136 --> 01:39:10,034
That is how you become the light of joy, of peace.

390
01:39:27,463 --> 01:39:31,295
What has been  said about what you are.

391
01:39:35,878 --> 01:39:41,163
That is how, see, is whatever is described about,

392
01:39:41,283 --> 01:39:43,826
you become that.

393
01:40:02,087 --> 01:40:05,023
If there is a light you don’t have to say

394
01:40:05,055 --> 01:40:08,834
that it is a light, it is.

395
01:40:29,734 --> 01:40:33,622
It is not a stamp that you have to use.

396
01:40:52,926 --> 01:41:01,207
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali 
of the lights of Sahaja Yoga.

397
01:41:14,615 --> 01:41:21,569
I don’t know what to say, 
in what state of bliss I am.

398
01:41:40,937 --> 01:41:49,067
All the ripples you have created
 of joy are overwhelming for it.

399
01:42:23,322 --> 01:42:25,583
No words can describe.

400
01:42:25,707 --> 01:42:30,294
I cannot compose poetry.

401
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:47,615
Keep this light burning beautifully through meditation

402
01:43:11,795 --> 01:43:17,241
and you can become very strong 
because of light.

403
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:35,443
May God bless you, Happy Diwali to all of you.

404
01:43:57,987 --> 01:44:01,455
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one

405
01:44:01,487 --> 01:44:07,524
and my lecture have been three times said so

406
01:44:07,592 --> 01:44:13,689
you can imagine the time is been 
more spend than normal.

407
01:44:38,999 --> 01:44:45,930
Lastly there are many invited in India free.

408
01:44:46,482 --> 01:44:51,469
Most of them may not also pay,

409
01:44:51,493 --> 01:44:55,981
those who cannot pay for travel should let us know.

410
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:27,205
No no, we have invited many people to India.

411
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:35,232
They should give their names and 
those who are free for Ganapatipule

412
01:45:35,257 --> 01:45:38,450
but who have paid for the travelling

413
01:45:38,468 --> 01:45:42,925
and those who have not paid for travelling also should give their names.

414
01:46:24,765 --> 01:46:32,389
Also some of the letters who cannot paid are invited.

415
01:46:50,553 --> 01:46:52,354
May God bless you all.
