1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,040
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,
which means the rows of lights or, you can

2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
say, group of lights.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;
it's all right.

4
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:12,329
This Diwali has been a festival of very ancient
times in India. I already told in My previous

5
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,780
lectures what are these five days are. After
killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

6
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,549
when it was the darkest night of the year.
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern

7
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:04,309
times, because the worst time, as far as morality’s
concerned has been in these modern times.

8
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:16,839
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga. And as you
see around you’ll find out that there is

9
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:30,309
complete darkness as far as morality’s concerned,
but that's why there are all kinds of crisies.

10
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:45,219
Because of that, also, there are many who
are seeking the light, the truth.

11
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,530
In the darkness of ignorance - people have
no knowledge as to what they should do, why

12
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:07,349
or they are on this Earth. As you know very
well, that thousands and thousands of real

13
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,550
seekers who are born at this time. That is
why this job was given to Me is to create

14
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:30,159
Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance. It's
not an easy job because, on one side, we have

15
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:49,259
all the dark forces acting against the truth.
Also, on the other side, we have to fight

16
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,080
the false people who are taking advantage
of your seeking. Firstly, people don't know

17
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:18,050
what to seek, so all these false people have
been money-oriented and they tried to work

18
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,749
out marketing of their falsehood, and they
have the expertise to do it.

19
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:28,749
Somebody asked Me in Bogotá, a television
lady: “What about the cults that are killing

20
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,650
people and doing all sorts of things that
they did in Switzerland?”

21
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:47,090
So I said, “It's true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals who

22
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:56,379
call themselves as spiritual, but the mistake
lies with the people who follow them.”

23
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:05,050
So a person who is absolutely immoral, absolutely
dishonest, who launders money to Swiss banks,

24
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,640
cannot be a guru. He used to buy these drugs
and sell them. He used to buy weapons and

25
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,729
sell them. He was worse than his disciple,
much worse. They have used a kind of a suggestion

26
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:34,729
from the books of so-called Guruvita or something
where it is said you should surrender everything

27
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:45,629
to your guru. That means it was to suggest
that a disciple should be willing to surrender

28
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,599
everything to the guru.

29
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,140
So, it was for the disciple; but for the guru,
he should not grab anything, he shouldn't

30
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:05,140
ask for anything, he should not be greedy.
All these things are already written down.

31
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:13,189
But nobody reads what is required of a guru
and only they see that you have to surrender

32
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,219
everything to the guru.

33
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:25,219
Why I'm telling you all this? Because how
the darkness is so deep and so dangerous.

34
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:33,089
Moreover, the other day I read an article
which said that in Milan there is a very,

35
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:40,749
very organization, a global organization of
satanicism. Many politicians and many people

36
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:47,879
in the government, very highly placed ministers
- prime ministers - are involved in it. Many

37
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,319
people who are bank managers or bank owners,
and also the people who call themselves social

38
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,290
workers, and also those who have got peace
award and this award, that award. So this

39
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,410
is what is the worst times of Kali Yuga, modern
times.

40
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:08,410
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day, is
where a brother and sisters celebrate together

41
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,910
for relationship, which is so pure and so
protective. That is to show that, after putting

42
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,669
the lights, morality must be the first priority
for the society. I need not tell you this

43
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,580
today immoral side of modern times. It's horrible.
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern

44
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,040
times where people don’t know how they relate
to each other for which, as I told you before,

45
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Christ has suggested that you take out the
eyes of a man who looks at a woman twice,

46
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:53,200
because He found, at that time, people were
horrid. Who can follow Christ in these modern

47
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,200
times? Both the eyes, both the hands will
be cut off. On the whole, if you see, I haven't

48
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:12,790
seen any Christian like that, so far.

49
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,790
Mohammed Sahib was even more strict. He thought
nothing has been done for the women, so he

50
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,250
passed through some regulations about women
also. So he said that any woman who looks

51
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,250
at a man with bad eyes should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning. I don't know

52
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,280
what would have happened to the American ladies,
if they had followed this.

53
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,630
So when I came to this earth I discovered
that these two are very difficult, especially

54
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,330
in Kali Yuga. These laws are actually meant
for not normal human beings, but for angels.

55
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,380
So, modern man is even worse than a normal
human being, because they want something destructive

56
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,039
all the time, like the Spanish ask the bull
to hit them.

57
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:09,039
Now the description of modern times is there
to show you in what times we are living. And

58
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:20,570
I realized it's not an easy thing to talk
to them about anything that is good without

59
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:27,309
giving them realization. Unless and until
you give them realization, nothing can penetrate

60
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:31,590
into their minds on just mental level. And
also giving only lectures and sermons, the

61
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,630
whole thing will be at a mental level only.
And also the religions, that are so-called,

62
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,869
are really very harmful for the spiritual
growth of human beings. I felt that enlightenment

63
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:46,400
is the only way one can save this world. In
this darkness of ignorance, the darkest night

64
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,250
of the whole history of this world, we needed
light and lights, many lights.

65
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:59,250
[Shri Mataji speaks aside to the interpreter/translator:
“Agni? Did you say in Sanskrit? Yes, Agni

66
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,570
means fire in Sanskrit language.]

67
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:12,570
All right. So the world divided into so many
countries, so many races, so many languages

68
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:20,880
and also their own thinking - to think of
a global religion was only possible when people

69
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,970
got their realization.

70
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,970
So, I had to study human beings, what are
their problems. So, in a light, in India,

71
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:37,130
we have the pot or the container, which is
made of clay, then the oil, and then the wick.

72
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:46,710
Now, this body, this mind, we can call all
that is visible and is within, is all the

73
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:59,220
pot, and the oil is the compassion, the love.
And the wick is the Kundalini, the pure desire,

74
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:08,530
and the spark is the Spirit. So, the - first
of all the container has to be all right.

75
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,590
It should be able to contain the oil properly
and should not allow it to ooze out.

76
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,859
Now there are two holes that cause problem.
One is your ego, another your conditionings.

77
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:24,229
So, if a Sahaja Yogi thinks of his conditionings,
that "I am a Christian,” or, he can say,

78
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:30,789
that, “I come from this race, I'm this community."
So all these limitations with which we have

79
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:37,789
built ourselves are so flimsy that they break
out, because there’s no reality in them.

80
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,330
There's no substance, so they fizzle out.
They all act like possessions and a person

81
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,340
becomes absolutely blind.

82
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,359
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen Christians
will adhere to Christ, Muslims will adhere

83
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:55,720
to Mohammed Sahib or to Ali, and others will
adhere to the conditionings from which they

84
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,720
have come. But they don't adhere to Me, so
they cannot see the integration of all these

85
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,160
personalities in One Person. Now, one has
to know, on this point, that you have got

86
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,059
the light. You are enlightened. You are not
an egg. You have become a bird. So, you have

87
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,849
to give up all that is falsehood.

88
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:28,419
If you are fully enlightened, you will give
up automatically, you don’t have to be told.

89
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,289
When the light is enlightened, it automatically
feels responsible that it has to give light.

90
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:39,289
Nobody has to tell that, "You please give
light" because it is light now. Because it

91
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,789
is eternal light, nothing can kill it. I will
say a Sanskrit shloka , [Shri Mataji speaks

92
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:52,780
in Sanskrit] - means it cannot be killed by
anyone, not air can blow it away, nothing

93
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,549
can destroy it. The - even if you want to
suck it, you cannot. It's such a powerful

94
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:04,549
light you have got within yourself. You can
verify whether it is eternal or not. You should

95
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:13,789
introspect and see for yourself. You've got
such a unique light within you. Not in the

96
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,510
history of this world of spirituality so many
have got realization, such light within them.

97
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:30,510
So how could these stupid, flimsy, useless
conditionings dominate you now when you are

98
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:39,239
the carrier of eternal light? But if you don't
respect this eternal life, then the conditionings

99
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,400
will put it off. This is the only problem,
that you have the freedom. You want to have

100
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,059
the eternal life, you'll have it, otherwise
this light can be damaged completely.

101
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:02,830
So, the another hole is that of ego. One side,
conditioning can be resolved by the sense

102
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,489
of responsibility. The same sense of responsibility,
when asserted through ego, could be very dangerous.

103
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:14,489
This light can become fire and it can burn
the house of Sahaja Yoga. In normal life,

104
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,640
we know that light is for giving us light,
not for burning houses; but when you get to

105
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:31,830
ego in Sahaja Yoga, you can think that you
are responsible for Sahaja Yoga, but this

106
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:39,250
responsibility should not give you an idea
that you are in charge of Sahaja Yoga. So,

107
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:51,119
then gradually you become so right-sided and
people are surprised that how this man who

108
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,090
was normal has become like a bull in the china
shop.

109
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:05,090
So you are not in charge of Sahaja Yoga. It's
like government servants. They are supposed

110
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,919
to be servants, but they are the bosses. They
become bosses. So the whole understanding

111
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,869
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaja Yoga.

112
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:22,049
The second part is the oil, which is compassion,
which is natural, innate and joy-giving. This

113
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:29,049
oil has to be pure. The compassion has to
be pure. I have seen many Sahaja Yogis try

114
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:40,420
to trouble the leaders. They oppose the leader
and try to hinder the work of Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,110
Now, these are supposed to be Sahaja Yogis
and they don't understand that if their compassion

116
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,840
is pure they will appreciate their leader
because the leader is doing such a compassionate

117
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,840
work. Of course, pure compassion, one must
understand, has nothing to do with greed,

118
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:03,910
with temptations, is nothing to do. One has
to feel such nearness with the leader and

119
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,760
appreciativeness of the work he or she is
putting in. So, compassion cannot be impure.

120
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,180
There cannot be lust in it. Moreover, this
compassion should be expressed in such a decent

121
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,690
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

122
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,290
Thank God to AIDS, one good thing has happened,
don’t - people don't kiss you. First time

123
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:31,960
when I went to Western countries, I was just
bombarded with kisses. I didn't know what

124
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,960
to say – I mean, it’s horrible. There
may not be anything wrong in the mind, but

125
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,520
it's so indecent and stupid. Long time back
I was told it was written on Indian airports,

126
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,530
"Please don't kiss the custom officers." [laughter]
In modern times a man can kiss a woman, but

127
00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:00,530
he can't kiss a man. I mean, it's absurd.
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

128
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,960
now they don't even hug, poor things, they
just touch with hands.... So, and now I've

129
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,960
seen many people who make a goal and are excited,
so they run out of the field. They don't know

130
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,620
what to do.... [laughter]

131
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,620
So, for Sahaja Yogis, we should know men can
kiss men and can hug them - there's nothing

132
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,240
wrong - and same with the ladies. Otherwise,
in excitement, they might run out of the field

133
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,840
of Sahaja Yoga. Men need not touch women,
women need not touch men. It's all right.

134
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,840
What is this nonsense? You can't express your
love? Say for India we have a rule that a

135
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:58,130
lady can touch the younger man and a man can
touch a much older woman, who could be a mother,

136
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,650
sister-in-law, anyone, which I think is a
good rule because it has worked out.

137
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:13,650
So, for compassion, it has to have decency
as fragrance in the oil. So how do we express

138
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,100
our compassion? We have rakhi sisters, rakhi
brothers, but I know of a lady who became

139
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:30,310
friendly with rich boys as rakhi brothers.
Or the other way round also, that many boys

140
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,870
became rakhi sisters of rich women - Racki
brothers

141
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:46,870
So, one has to understand that it is not for
money that you should become rakhi brothers

142
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:01,150
and sisters and to exploit, but for compassion.
You have to express your rakhi relationship

143
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:10,390
just for the protection of each other. The
compassion is so joy giving that you should

144
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,320
have not such conditions of money or any other
such stupid conditions which will kill your

145
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,840
joy. But another thing also is that to express
your love, you use some things as presents

146
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:38,500
that gives you joy. That doesn't mean, by
any chance, that you just give it to your

147
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,220
rakhi sister and not even to your wife, some
present.

148
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,780
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion
has to rise in the plant, giving love to different

149
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,630
parts, in different ways, whatever is required,
and that it then evaporates or goes back to

150
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,630
its source. Attachment is the killer of pure
love and compassion. So try to always find

151
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,470
out, introspect. Are you attached to your
children, to your wife or to your rakhi sister

152
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,210
or to anything, attached? Then there's a danger
that you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

153
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,180
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely
detached and nourishing the different relationships

154
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,830
that you have in a proper way, your joy is
perfect. Ambition is another killer of joy.

155
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,740
So, if you have to be ambitious, you have
to be only ambitious about Sahaja Yoga, so

156
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,740
that you humble down. One promise in Sahaja
Yoga, is that your life will be full of joy.

157
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,490
There is no need to take out your eyes, cut
your hands, no punishments. If you have too

158
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,460
many holes, you need not come to Sahaj Yoga.
You have to become a real holy person, not

159
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,960
full of holes. I must say that you are all
"your holinesses." I’m not. I’m not, because

160
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,250
I've not become. You have become. Supposing,
somebody has to call you as a man, will they

161
00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:00,250
say, "Oh, man, such and such"? No, because
you are a man. What you - whatever you achieve

162
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,330
is attached to you, whatever you have achieved.

163
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,870
[Shri Mataji commenting on translators: “This
Russian seems to be long translation, and

164
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,340
sometimes very small, and sometimes Romanian
very short, sometimes very long.”] [Laughter]

165
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,760
All right, so now the another thing that is
promised is bliss. What is bliss is the experience

166
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,190
of joy. It can come from anything. Maybe you
find you were in an accident, and you were

167
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,800
suddenly saved, protected. You are amazed,
and everybody feels the bliss. You also feel

168
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,240
the bliss.

169
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,730
[Laughter. Shri Mataji commenting on translation:
“To be very frank, I cannot translate. I

170
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,580
know languages, but from one language to another,
I cannot translate. That’s something wrong

171
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,540
with Me.”]

172
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,750
[Yogi: "But you understand very well, Shri
Mataji, what we say."]

173
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,750
[Shri Mataji: Well, it is very easy. See the
thought first is in an abstract form …(translation)…It’s

174
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:06,330
an abstract form, that's all I said. [laughs]
]

175
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:13,330
[The Russian yogi gives a very long translation.
"This is the reverse, Shri Mataji."] [Laughter]

176
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,090
All right, but thank you very much.

177
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,090
So, it is - you see, the - at that point anybody
can know what is the thought is because later

178
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,720
on it becomes a language, takes words. So,
if you can jump at that abstract, then you’ll

179
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,780
know that, but you have to put attention quite
a lot. Now, you have to pay attention to that

180
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,520
abstract form, you see, continuously

181
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,520
So now, to solve this problem, I would request
you all, to learn, at least, English language.

182
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,070
[applause] I'm not saying Sanskrit, but English.

183
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:15,070
Now, it’s the Kundalini, which is a pure
desire, is already existing; you don't have

184
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,240
to do anything. Maybe the cotton is not clean.
It has some problems, because it has passed

185
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,540
through dirty hands, but it can be cleaned.
Kabir has said something very beautiful about

186
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:47,450
it. He says that when the intestines of a
goat are inside the stomach, they say, "Mai,

187
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:58,270
mai, mai," means "I, I, I." But when they
are pulled out and are made into strings,

188
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:08,060
and put on a instrument for cleaning the cotton
wool - put on the instrument that cleans the

189
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,760
cotton wool. You know, in India we call it
"Duna." And when it is being strung, it says,

190
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,760
"Tu hi, tu hi, tu hi," means "You, you are,
you are, you are."

191
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,290
[Shri Mataji and the translators discuss these
words.]

192
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:44,360
All right, whatever it is. So, it means that
when your Kundalini is not working out well

193
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,190
because there are problems in your chakras,
what you have to say, "You are, you are."

194
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:56,190
You say that. "You are sakshat this. You are
sakshat that." Sakshat means "in reality."

195
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,200
In reality. You don't say, "You are Her Holiness
something." You said, "You are Ganesha. You

196
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,720
are this." That is how you cleanse all the
dirt or all the problems of your chakras.

197
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,190
By this, you also correct your conditionings
and your ego. Then you do not take the credit

198
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:36,190
for anything. You do not feel you are doing
something, and the whole personality changes

199
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:46,620
into a complete instrument like the flute
in the hands of Shri Krishna. Then you see

200
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:53,690
your work, everything as the work of the Divine.
That is how you become enlightened. That is

201
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:04,260
how you become the light of joy, of peace.
A lot has been said about what you are. That

202
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,940
is how, you see, is whatever is described
about, you become that. If there is a light,

203
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:59,350
you don’t have to say that it is a light.
It is. It is not a stamp that you have to

204
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,980
use.

205
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:37,980
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali of the
lights of Sahaja Yoga. I don't know what to

206
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:56,410
say, in what state of bliss I am. All the
ripples you have created of joy are overwhelming

207
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:12,470
for Me. No words can describe. I cannot compose
poetry. Keep this light burning beautifully

208
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:51,740
through meditation, and you can become very
strong beacons of light.

209
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:12,750
May God bless you, it’s Happy Diwali to
all of you.

210
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,760
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one,
and My lecture has been three times said,

211
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:31,570
so you can imagine the time has been more
spent than normal.

212
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:44,770
Lastly, there are many who are invited in
India free. Most of them may not also pay.

213
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Those who cannot pay for travel should let
us know… No, no - we have invited many people

214
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,420
to India. They should give their names, and
those who are free, I mean free for Ganapatipule,

215
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:56,359
but they are paying for their traveling. And
those who

216
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:41,829
are not paying for traveling also should give

217
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,369
their names. Also some of

218
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:37,579
the leaders who cannot pay are invited.

219
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:07,319
May God bless you all.
