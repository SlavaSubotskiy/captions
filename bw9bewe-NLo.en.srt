1
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,375
The problem was

2
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,834
that we could not

3
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,500
arrange the cooking nearer your stay

4
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,834
when you were here to walk a lot.

5
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,125
But that walking was, I think, quite nice

6
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,041
and must have helped you.

7
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,166
It's good for diarrhea and other problems that you have.

8
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:03,041
Actually, I had seen the place but I hadn't seen the,

9
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,834
all the hostels and residential places.

10
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,750
But for your information now somebody has donated Me

11
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,500
one acre of land free, free of cost,

12
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,834
next to the sea on the other side. It is beautiful.

13
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,625
And you should all send him a letter of thanks for that.

14
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,458
So for next year I'm sure we can organize

15
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,583
something much better,

16
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:55,834
in a much more collective way.

17
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:02,709
Now the next tour is going to be,

18
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,834
as you know,

19
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,250
via Pune, Rahuri, Akluj.

20
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,250
And these places are of more importance to us,

21
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,500
because Rahuri is a place where My forefathers ruled,

22
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,291
so it's a very powerful place,

23
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,166
because they were great Devi bhaktas.

24
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,625
Also all the Naths, like Machindranath, Gorakhnath,

25
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,250
all these great evolved souls called as avadutas

26
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:43,291
who were incarnations of the great Primordial Masters,

27
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,250
worked in that area.

28
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,417
They are the ones who talked of kundalini to begin with,

29
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,542
openly.

30
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,000
Then Pune, as you know, is called as Punyapattanam,

31
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:03,458
is a very holy place since ages.

32
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,125
And then you'll be going to a place called Nira,

33
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:13,709
which is a river named after My name,

34
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,792
and this river has got lot of land around it

35
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,583
which we have purchased,

36
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,709
where we are going to do agricultural work.

37
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,458
And also you will see there the Bhima River

38
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,917
where you'll have your morning baths,

39
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,125
and you'll enjoy the river part of it.

40
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,709
Also they have invited you for a function there.

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,375
They have a very big function for two days.

42
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,000
That is why I am not coming,

43
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,125
because I wouldn't be able to do any programs

44
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,458
during that time, but you enjoy yourselves there.

45
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,834
Then you are going to another interesting place

46
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,000
called Wani, which is a hill station

47
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,917
and a very beautiful place where there's a dam as well,

48
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,583
and then you'll be returning back.

49
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm taking this opportunity to talk to you

50
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,250
because I seldom get time to talk to you.

51
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,417
Now, as far as these outside things are concerned,

52
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,000
they should all nourish you for your ascent.

53
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:25,792
You have to see how much you have achieved within,

54
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,792
what kind of temperament you have developed,

55
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,999
how much detachment,

56
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:34,917
how much collective and how much generosity.

57
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,917
All these things are to be seen.

58
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,417
Judge yourself, don't ask others to judge you.

59
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,583
How much balance, how much wisdom,

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,083
because all these things should settle you down

61
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,792
in a way that gives you the necessary balance.

62
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:58,667
I do not know how many years more we can do this,

63
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,792
but I think it's very good,

64
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,458
because now I see the difference

65
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,250
in the vibrations of people.

66
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,458
Even before we had started in Ganapatipule and today,

67
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,583
there is such a tremendous difference.

68
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:13,667
Actually I am getting cool breeze from your side now!

69
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,083
So the ascent is the main attention

70
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,875
and it's the main concern for all of us.

71
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,875
You have come here for your ascent.

72
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,417
I know there must have been lots of difficulties

73
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,583
and lots of inconveniences;

74
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:37,291
some people also burnt their skin - I am sorry for that.

75
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,917
But in this country overdoing is regarded as something

76
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:48,417
improper, and we should try to avoid overdoing anything.

77
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,875
So by overdoing it

78
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,709
we actually go to the right or the left,

79
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,583
and so please try to avoid everything that is overdoing.

80
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,583
For example, you may like your bath

81
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:03,875
in the Bhima River very much, but that's very nice

82
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,125
at a point where it is shallow;

83
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,667
but where it is deep, you should not go there.

84
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,458
I'm only worried on that point because it's still,

85
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,208
one has to understand to keep yourself

86
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,583
in complete control and not to go to places

87
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,542
which are dangerous.

88
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,959
Apart from that it is dangerous to you,

89
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,750
it is dangerous to the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement

90
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,083
and also to Me, because I get very worried

91
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,625
and upset if you get anything.

92
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,875
So the main thing is

93
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:44,041
that you should keep yourself in the center.

94
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,750
Do not go to extremes in anything.

95
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,083
Everyone respects you if you are in the center,

96
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,375
but if you go to extremes they think

97
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,625
there's something wrong, basically wrong with you.

98
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,667
And also it upsets the whole of the program.

99
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,959
So My advice is that keep to the center,

100
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,375
do not overdo anything,

101
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,041
keep everything in proper shape;

102
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,000
because it is strenuous for you people to travel like this,

103
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,625
to face this sun.

104
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the coldest time in Maharashtra,

105
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,333
so you can imagine that what else we could do?

106
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,166
I mean, we have to achieve the results

107
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,375
with the maximum of combinations.

108
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,500
And I am sorry for the people who got these burns;

109
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,417
and actually because I had to treat them

110
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,750
and all that I was so delayed

111
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,750
that the whole program delayed, delayed, delayed - I mean,

112
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,625
it was too much. But now, no more of this.

113
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,750
Please don't go in the sun at all, there is no need,

114
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,709
you have had enough of sun.

115
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,999
And the sun melts your brain,

116
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,417
and that makes persons mad in this country:

117
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,709
if we go in the sun we end up as mad people.

118
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,625
So must be happening to brains also something,

119
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,375
so it's better not to go in the sun at all

120
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,375
- keep it like that. Just for a while it's all right,

121
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:12,750
but don't sit in the sun.

122
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,625
It's very inviting, I know, because you don't get the sun,

123
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,959
but there is sun's rays inside this room, everywhere.

124
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,625
So you shouldn't go and sit in the sun at all.

125
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,375
That may really give you troubles,

126
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,542
because the sun in Akluj will be quite heavy,

127
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,834
and I'm telling you also this because I may not be with you.

128
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,709
So please look after yourself,

129
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,458
that is the only thing you can do for Me.

130
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,999
For yourself, you must do your meditation,

131
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,917
you must worry about your ascent

132
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,709
and don't leave your things here and there, be careful.

133
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,125
I am very happy the way they appreciated you

134
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,792
in the Temple of Mahalakshmi,

135
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,250
and that they respected you

136
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,750
and gave you something in your oti,

137
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,917
and that is something really very sweet of them

138
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,333
to accept you so readily into their own style

139
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,125
and into their community, you see.

140
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,041
And they said that, "We couldn't make out who is Indian,

141
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,125
who is not Indian", because I think in Ganapatipule

142
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,959
also your skin has become little

143
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,000
less pale and maybe they said,

144
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,041
We couldn't make out who is who.

145
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,834
So it's very good that now things are working out

146
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,458
that we are getting little, little homogeneous temperaments.

147
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:35,458
Regarding pujas, as we had three pujas before

148
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,834
and the fourth one in Ganapatipule,

149
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,125
here also you'll have three pujas.

150
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,999
In these three pujas I'm sure,

151
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,834
this being a quieter group,

152
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,667
you'll achieve much more,

153
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,250
and things will be very much better.

154
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:56,000
If you have any problems you can let Me know,

155
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,709
we can arrange all that.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,583
But one thing, be sure that you do not over-exert yourself,

157
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,792
neither you starve yourself or overeat.

158
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,999
Anything doing too much will not be good for this trip.

159
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,792
Because I think in the second group

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,583
we are going to achieve much more

161
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,125
than what we had achieved before.

162
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,583
So the second group people should try

163
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:24,458
to keep to a normal life, more attention to the spirit,

164
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,999
more attention to their ascent.

165
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,667
The last but not the least is the great news

166
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,750
that so many others want to get engaged.

167
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
I'll be very happy to get them engaged,

168
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,542
either in Pune or in Rahuri.

169
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,500
It will be a very good idea, those who want to get engaged.

170
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,166
And if there are some people who still want to get married,

171
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,875
let Me know. Maybe we might be able to arrange something

172
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,583
in Rahuri.

173
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,999
But the best is that those who want to get engaged,

174
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,417
it's very easy to be done,

175
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,083
and it will be a good idea.

176
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:02,333
So let Me know before we leave Pune,

177
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,542
anyone of such wants to.

178
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,166
Now if you have any questions or anything to be said,

179
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,166
please say it now,

180
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,208
because I won't get such a chance to talk to you,

181
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,083
this being such a small group here

182
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,792
- otherwise always in a puja;

183
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,417
now in Pune you'll find at least

184
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,208
five times more people than you are.

185
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,500
What's she saying?

186
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,291
Hard time with your attention - what?

187
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,083
What is it?

188
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,041
She wants to know how to settle her attention,

189
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,667
and how to go deeper in meditation.

190
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,041
Your attention goes to which places, is the point.

191
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,375
You try to see around more.

192
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,458
You see, first of all in meditation you must discuss this,

193
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,709
and there are many others who can tell you,

194
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,000
they'll work it out.

195
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,750
And secondly the best way, you see,

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,625
is to put your eyes on the Mother Earth.

197
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,500
Concentrate on the Mother Earth is the best way.

198
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,375
When you are walking,

199
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,583
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

200
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,250
If somebody is talking to you,

201
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,458
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

202
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,000
You see, then you'll absorb everything better

203
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,917
and you'll be stationed better, all right?

204
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,500
That's a very good thing to think about, that

205
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,000
our attention should not be frittered away.

206
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,917
Gradually you'll settle down.

207
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,500
I think most of you who have come for the first time

208
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,625
will find it a little difficult in the beginning to adjust,

209
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,333
but gradually you will.

210
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,458
Because first of all our attention goes to small,

211
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,792
small things, like I have to sit on the ground

212
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,458
or You have to go by buses ,

213
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,834
or some sort of a filthy thing you see somewhere.

214
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,333
So the attention always goes to the defects

215
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,458
and the loopholes and to the filth,

216
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,500
because attention has been like that.

217
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,709
But then it starts going to the places of beauty.

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,792
In little, little things you start seeing the beauty,

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,250
in little, little things you start seeing the Divine.

220
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,458
And then that's the time you should know that

221
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,792
your attention will enjoy everything.

222
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,917
But normally you see the attention,

223
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,959
specially the kind of attentions we have,

224
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,375
goes to the wrong things.

225
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,792
What is the loophole? We start judging everyone,

226
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
we start judging every place.

227
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:01,000
Now see this place, if you sit here: to Me it is marvelous,

228
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,500
to you it may be just made out of what - this tin business,

229
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,333
this, that; all that you will start thinking.

230
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,709
To Me it's beautiful,

231
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,458
because I see these beautiful saris spread here

232
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,709
and the beautiful flower arrangements beautifully done,

233
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,041
something so special.

234
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,041
And the background and everything done with such care.

235
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,500
How did they go there,

236
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,792
and how did they have these things tied up?

237
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,041
It is remarkable.

238
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,959
All these things come to My mind,

239
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,834
and I start feeling very overjoyed

240
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,625
that My boys have worked so hard to put all these things up

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,041
and how nicely, how they must have arranged it.

242
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,583
All these ideas come into My head and I feel very elevated.

243
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't see the tins or I don't see anything else.

244
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,625
It is what you see, where your attention goes.

245
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,000
So try to see something beautiful.

246
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,333
There is so many beautiful things that one can see.

247
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,500
Now where, what I see is the heart of My children,

248
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,458
the way they have done it, isn't it?

249
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,250
If you are a deep person you can see

250
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,125
how they have spread the saris sweetly,

251
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,709
how they have spread the flowers, how they've done it.

252
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,375
So it is the attention: where does it go?

253
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,709
When you start seeing for yourself, What is my comfort?

254
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,625
I should have this, I should have that,

255
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,041
then there is no joy.

256
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,333
But the joy lies in seeing the deeper side

257
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,709
of what they have done for us,

258
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,959
how they have worked for us,

259
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,709
how they have brought things for us,

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,375
how they have cooked for us with love.

261
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,709
You are doing no work

262
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,834
compared to what these people are doing, no doubt.

263
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,834
You are moving like royal people really, to be...

264
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,375
And they had to do it.

265
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,250
Specially Ganapatipule was very difficult place.

266
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,375
People had to come all the way from Nagpur,

267
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,125
fifty people came to cook your food.

268
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,625
Money is not everything.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,959
Even if you pay money, you can't do that. It's love,

270
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,750
it's the feeling, it's the attention,

271
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:58,125
it's the generosity of looking after the guests.

272
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,083
And that is how one should enjoy

273
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,542
how much they have done for us, how we are enjoying it.

274
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,333
That's how your heart will become deeper and deeper.

275
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,000
But if you have a convex heart

276
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,583
which always looks at something that's wrong, something bad,

277
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,625
something this, or at things,

278
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,500
What should I buy, what should I purchase?

279
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,583
All that, that can go off, your head.

280
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,625
But if you want to purchase something nice with a good heart,

281
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,125
then you will just find it whatever you want.

282
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,959
And you can do it very fast.

283
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,959
When I did big yesterday shopping for all the centers

284
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,458
and all that - worth, I think,

285
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,834
in one lakh of rupees perhaps - for all the Indian centers,

286
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,583
and I did it in no time.

287
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,709
Because it was for them, I was much better off.

288
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:53,834
If it was for Myself I don't think I would have done so well.

289
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,000
But you'd be surprised, I never buy anything for Myself,

290
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,750
I don't have time.

291
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,875
You people give Me so much, I don't have to buy, either.

292
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,125
So it is how you look at things, how you do things,

293
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,667
how you work it out.

294
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,667
And yesterday the shop I went to was all full of fragrances.

295
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,667
Everything there was fragrance and everybody was feeling it.

296
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,625
It's just because I was enjoying the whole thing,

297
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,166
enjoying it, doing for others.

298
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,041
It's not others - who is the other?

299
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,166
Because Sahaja yogis are not the others for Me.

300
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,250
I am doing for Myself, but My greater being,

301
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,834
My higher being.

302
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,500
That is how you should look at things, all right?

303
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,999
Then you will enjoy.

304
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,959
And now what I have to say to the people of Sangli

305
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,083
is that here we did a puja quite in the past

306
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,875
and also did once again recently,

307
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,667
and also in Sangli a lot has come in the newspaper

308
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,458
and that is why a lot of work has been done.

309
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,458
And here Sahaja Yoga can also establish itself here

310
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:04,250
because the atmosphere is very nice and silent,

311
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,667
and also all the people here are ready to help.

312
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,709
So to the people of Sangli I want to give a small gift,

313
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,458
and please they should accept it, this is My request.

314
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:23,500
There is also one more gift but it is still in the market.

315
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,291
Who will take it? it is still in the market.

316
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,792
I bought lots of things but they're yet not delivered,

317
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,792
so one thing I have to give them.

318
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,083
Bring it, come now.

319
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,291
So this is our Sahaja yogi, Mr. Tawde,

320
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:54,542
who is a very big officer here. He has done this.

321
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,583
This gentleman is Mr. Mali who is the district

322
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,208
- what do we say to district ?

323
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,250
- he is the district agriculture officer here

324
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,834
who looks after the agriculture of the whole district,

325
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,375
and he got his realization in '75.

326
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,208
And now he is posted here, so he came for the puja.

327
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,709
All his family is here.

328
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,917
So Mr. Tawde who has done all the good work for you,

329
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,208
give him a hand.

330
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,625
Also here

331
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,875
there is Mr. Yadav Sahib

332
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,834
who has published everything in the paper,

333
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,375
and who is the newspaper gentleman here.

334
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,542
Mr. Yadav - give him a hand.

335
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,250
They are so highly placed, but so humble - just look at that.

336
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,166
He is the man who is in charge of the whole thing here,

337
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,500
he is the engineer.

338
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,875
And he's the gentleman who is in charge of the,

339
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,709
all the districts agricultural activities,

340
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,125
he is the officer in charge.

341
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,250
And another one is the editor of the newspaper.

342
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,834
You see, when people get egoistical, they just don't relate

343
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,417
themselves to the surroundings.

344
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,500
They don't understand how far they are.

345
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:48,834
It's like a ball which you just give it a push

346
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,417
and it goes up in the air,

347
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:54,166
without knowing that it's just a ball full of air.

348
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,417
That is why you call bumptious, you see?

349
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:02,792
So those who really are solid people,

350
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:07,458
who have some solid training and solid upbringing,

351
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,875
they don't get into ego trips,

352
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,667
they don't get into these trips. They,

353
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,417
they first of all become very humble,

354
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,542
and try to learn and become humbler,

355
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,583
and again learn and become humbler.

356
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,999
Like Newton has said that:

357
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,583
"I am like a little, I am like a little child

358
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,709
collecting pebbles on the shores of Knowledge"

359
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,542
- a person like Newton, he said so.

360
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:42,125
But nowadays, I find

361
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,417
it's difficult to find people of that kind.

362
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,125
But those who are very learned,

363
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,792
in the West also I've seen them being very humble people;

364
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:56,667
in their writings, in their whole behavior

365
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,208
you can see they are very humble people.

366
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:03,542
Humility is a sign of knowledge.

367
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,417
When the tree is loaded it bends down.

368
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:12,000
When it is loaded with fruits, it bends down.

369
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:17,208
In the same way a person who has knowledge will bend,

370
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,750
will be very humble.

371
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,625
Now, today's puja has really a lot of importance as it is

372
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,625
today the Puja of Shri Mahalakshmi, and the importance

373
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:36,125
which we have of Shri Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga is of

374
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,375
no other Shakti. Because Shri Mahalakshmi is the Shakti

375
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,250
which we call as the Sushumna channel,

376
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:45,999
She resides in it, and through Her

377
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,166
the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

378
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,917
To make this Mahalakshmini Shakti strong, in our evolution

379
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,959
there occurred many events, and in this the

380
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,625
important event was the incarnation of Shri Mahalakshmi.

381
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,500
Shri Mahalakshmini took many incarnations,

382
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,583
and She is so courageous that She took

383
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,750
the form of a human body and took birth in this Universe,

384
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,917
and has done a lot of work.

385
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,875
It is surprising that nobody gave us information

386
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,834
about all these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

387
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:22,375
and nobody has the deep and detailed description about this.

388
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,583
Now the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is based

389
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:29,959
on the Principle of Shri Lakshmi. That means the Mother

390
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,208
of Shri Lakshmi is Shri Mahalakshmi,

391
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,375
we should say, the Mother of Shri Lakshmi.

392
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,250
That means when Shri Lakshmi comes to humans,

393
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,250
Shri Lakshmi is the one with balance,

394
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,333
a woman in the form of a Devi.

395
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,709
She is in such a balance that She stands on a lotus.

396
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,375
She has two lotuses in Her hand.

397
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,375
One of the lotuses is pink, and also in that

398
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,166
lotus is also a tenderness. The meaning of the pink lotus

399
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,999
is such that the person who is a lakshmipati, he will have

400
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,667
Shri Lakshmi, that is in the character of that person

401
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,709
will be this pinkness that means will have sweetness in

402
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,500
his character. He should not be dry.

403
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:16,500
The second thing is that if we would see a lotus, then

404
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,792
in that lotus, even if a bee comes into it, this bee gets

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,667
also a place in it, and the bee has so many thorns,

406
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,959
but even then it gets a place in the lotus. That means

407
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:30,208
it is also welcomed. Therefore, the person who has

408
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:34,250
Shri Lakshmi, he will welcome everyone, however the guest is.

409
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,959
He will ask for the comforts of everyone,

410
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,208
even if that person is small or big. He will take care

411
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,999
of everyone according to their social status,

412
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:45,208
he will be hospitable to everyone in a equal way.

413
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Third thing is that the meaning of it is

414
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:53,291
that one should be generous. And if in the hand of a person

415
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,959
there is no generosity, then such a person

416
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,667
is not a lakshmipati. Danat (the quality of generosity)

417
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:03,125
is such a joy-giving quality,

418
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:07,000
and it cannot be compared with acquiring anything.

419
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,125
The person who attains the power of generosity,

420
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:13,000
I think such a person is the greatest of all,

421
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,166
because such a person has reached to the

422
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,875
culmination point in the evolution of mankind.

423
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,959
One should be able to give generously. As Shri Lakshmi

424
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,625
donates with the left hand, in the same way

425
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:29,083
a person who is lakshmiputra (indicating the principle of

426
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:33,000
Lakshmi in a man) should also give generously with his left

427
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,834
hand in such a way that even the right hand does not know it.

428
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,959
Giving with the left hand signifies giving very sahaj

429
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:45,083
(spontaneously) without any effort. And all the desire

430
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:49,417
must be only of generosity. And truly in this world

431
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,041
there are so many material things, and I think for

432
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:56,083
all these things there is only one importance,

433
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,250
and that is these things we can give to others.

434
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,166
By means of generosity we can show the greatness

435
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:07,500
of our heart. We can show our affection and warmth,

436
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:11,083
and that is why all these things have importance,

437
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,166
otherwise there is no importance of all the material things.

438
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,458
There are so many statues of swayambhus. Amongst

439
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,125
them the statue of Shri Mahalakshmi is considered as the

440
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:29,250
By Her grace our Kundalini rises in the channel

441
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,875
of Shri Mahalakshmi. She is above Shri Lakshmi Principle.

442
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,709
Now this (right) hand is like this.

443
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:41,083
This hand is the symbol of shelter.

444
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:45,417
It has two meanings: shelter - give shelter to everyone,

445
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,792
this hand gives protection to everyone. But in reality

446
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:53,000
we see just the opposite. The lakshmipatis put a lot of

447
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,959
pressure and fear on everyone. On the contrary

448
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,333
She (Lakshmi) is just standing quietly on a lotus,

449
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,709
not showing off anything special about Her. Otherwise

450
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:07,417
people need cars and this and that, to show that they are

451
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,709
so wealthy and are superior in comparison to others.

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,500
On the other hand She is not putting any weight or

453
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:18,709
pressure on others. She is standing so lightly, so delicate

454
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,291
that nobody should be troubled because of Her. The real

455
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:25,125
lakshmipati will sit somewhere in the corner, will sit

456
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,875
with complete faith and silence, and will leave quietly.

457
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,000
Even if he wants to give something he will give

458
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,375
and say, Shri Mataji, this is something which is

459
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,458
my donation, but please do not disclose my

460
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,917
name, and You accept it somehow. I have given this

461
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,750
at Your Lotus Feet - finished now, I have nothing

462
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:47,041
to do with it any more. When I tell him that I do not

463
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,792
take money but it is to be given to the trust

464
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,667
(and for which we have to know the name of the donor)

465
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,625
he will say, You can put it in the name of anybody else,

466
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,834
I have no objection. I have given this to You,

467
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,375
I do not want my name to published. Only if You want to

468
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,834
disclose my name to the income tax authorities I do not mind,

469
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:09,333
but otherwise I do not want my name or anything.

470
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:13,709
He will be requesting very humbly not to disclose his name.

471
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:17,166
This person we can call is a real lakshmipati.

472
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,583
The (right) hand of Shri Lakshmi is pointing up in this way.

473
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,208
That means your attention should be above, towards a

474
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,999
higher goal. So when a person becomes a lakshmipati,

475
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,041
then his attention is such that he starts thinking,

476
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,208
Now I have become lakshmipati, but now, how can

477
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,000
I attain God? When this stage comes in a human being,

478
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:40,125
he has wealth and he receives a lot of wealth. Becomes rich,

479
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:44,083
and then when he gets the feeling of not achieving the inner

480
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,959
richness, then one can say that the Principle

481
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,458
of Shri Mahalakshmi has been awakened in him.

482
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,792
And in that Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi the Kundalini

483
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,417
is awakened. When She is awakened that is why we say,

484
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,750
"Udo, Ambe" meaning: "Shri Kundalini, please, get awakened."

485
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We say this in the temple of Shri Mahalakshmi,

486
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,625
because She can get awakened only through

487
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,041
the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi. And thus She is awakened

488
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,041
in the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi and then penetrates

489
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,583
the above chakras, and comes up and completely

490
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,041
penetrates the Chakra of Sahasrara. Now let us see

491
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,834
how many incarnations of Shi Mahalakshmi we've had.

492
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:25,542
Firstly, the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is very close

493
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,875
with a guru, a relation of plenty of love and purity.

494
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,291
Now if we see from the beginning, by all the Adi Gurus,

495
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,583
She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister.

496
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:39,333
Like the daughter of Janaka was Shri Sita - the form

497
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:44,999
of Mahalakshmi. She was the Principle of Mahalakshmi.

498
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,542
and She was the daughter of Janaka.

499
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,166
Then the sister of Shri Nanaka - Nanaki -

500
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,166
She was Mahalakshmi. Her relation was of sister.

501
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,999
In the same way, the daughter of Mohammed Sahib, Fatima,

502
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,709
She was Mahalakshmi. After Her, Radha was the form:

503
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,417
of Mahalakshmi, then comes Mary:

504
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,125
Mary was Shri Mahalakshmi,

505
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,083
and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure

506
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:09,875
that with Her purity She gave birth to Shri Christ.

507
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,542
So She was a form of complete pure Virgin.

508
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:15,417
And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity,

509
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,291
She got a son pure as Christ.

510
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,834
Because of these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

511
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,375
our chakras at the top within are being fixed up.

512
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,625
That means Shri Rama's Chakra is on the right side

513
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,875
of the heart, here She is in the form of Shri Sita,

514
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,458
here She is in the form of Radha,

515
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,333
here in the form of Mary. And at this place these powers of

516
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:38,750
Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahalakshmi and Shri Mahasaraswati

517
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,917
meets in the form of one Power which is Shri Adi Shakti.

518
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,875
She recides in Sahasrara

519
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,041
but it is said that in Sahasrara

520
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,542
She exists in a form of Mahamaya.

521
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,583
Adi Shakti is of a form of Mahamaya.

522
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,250
That is why the result of all these three Powers

523
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,625
was like this, that Adi Shakti comes

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,458
into this world in the form of Mahamaya

525
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,625
and She can penetrate the Sahasrara of everyone.

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,709
As you know, She is in front of you

527
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,041
and you know all about it.

528
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,834
So I don't need to tell anything more.

529
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,709
This is how, out of this Shri Mahalakshmi,

530
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,667
Shri Adi Shakti was incarnated. She has got all

531
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,208
the three Powers of Shri Mahakali, Mahalakshmi

532
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,333
and Shri Mahasaraswati. These Powers are within Her.

533
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,000
Only through this Shri Mahalakshmi Principle,

534
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,959
our pure desire - which is Shri Amba, actually power of

535
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,999
Shri Mahakali - can be awakened. She can do it.

536
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,792
That is why Adi Shakti is so important, because through

537
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:44,792
these three Powers, even if everything is ready, but

538
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:49,000
at the last what work has to be done,She is need.

539
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,667
That means the work is achieved through these Powers.

540
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,208
Even if this thing is very easy for us to achive,

541
00:33:56,583 --> 00:34:00,041
we do get it easily, but still you have to work hard;

542
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,999
otherwise that work cannot be done.

543
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,333
It is quite difficult. If it would have been possible

544
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,500
only by Shri Adi Shakti, then there wouldn't be any need

545
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:14,166
of doing all such confusion.

546
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:17,333
You have to work hard,

547
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,417
and your support is required to accomplish the task.

548
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,125
You are on the stage now, not Me.

549
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,917
You can take My power and use It,

550
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,834
but know that now you are on the stage.

551
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:31,834
And that is why you are worthy of worship. You are special.

552
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,999
What am I? Whatever powers I have,

553
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,083
I have them since eternity; there is nothing special about it.

554
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,166
But you should use them. You must receive it,

555
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,999
you must achieve it, you should have mastery over it.

556
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,208
This is the real desire of Shri Adi Shakti,

557
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,000
this is Her pure desire. And for this pure desire

558
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,500
She is striving very hard every moment. And in this

559
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:58,000
you have all earned it, achieved it, accepted with love,

560
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,333
and going ahead you have progressed in it.

561
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,083
This is a very big satisfaction for Me.

562
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,959
And in this satisfaction I forget everything,

563
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:10,291
like how much I had to suffer in the past.

564
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,917
In the past many years I suffered a lot.

565
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,250
How much Sita had to suffer, how much Radha

566
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,959
had to suffer, how much Mary had to suffer:

567
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,500
I forget all that past. I feel

568
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:24,500
as if nothing has happened in the past, and that

569
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,417
whatever is happening now is something special.

570
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,542
But in this incarnation one thing is to be remembered,

571
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:35,417
that Shri Mahalakshmi has incarnated in human form

572
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,959
- in human form. But the Devi which we call

573
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,792
as Shri Mahakali has not incarnated in human form.

574
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,333
She always existed in the form of a Devi.

575
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:46,583
That is why to come in the form of Devi is easy,

576
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,959
but to come in the form of a human being is very

577
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,208
difficult task. And to fight like a human being and

578
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:56,583
live with the human beings is even more difficult.

579
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:00,333
Also to live, keeping within the limitations of human beings,

580
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,959
is much more difficult. All this work in the form of human

581
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:07,875
beings was done by all the Devas, and today we are experiencing

582
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,917
the auspicious fruits of all the work done in the past.

583
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,750
The great work done in Ganapatipule is worthy to be written

584
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,917
in history; big work has been done, and it will keep

585
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,667
happening every year ahead. My ardent desire is that

586
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,000
it continue at least for the next three, four years.

587
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:26,417
If this happens, then you people will also get the idea, that

588
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,625
what we've started from Ganapati

589
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,875
has reached perfectly Sahasrara.

590
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,709
This is so Aditi (Primordial) that it's difficult to express

591
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
in words. And all this you should receive. You should receive

592
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,875
whatever belongs to Me, this is My only pure disire.

593
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,291
And when this works out, then I don't want anything

594
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,500
Let the ladies do the puja.

595
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:32,542
I will tell you what you have to do and you let them do it.

596
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:37,250
Do not touch it, do not touch with your hands.

597
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,583
Carefully, you should not touch the bowl even,

598
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,959
you do not touch with hand.

599
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,375
Hold at the edges. Only hold at the edge, and now put.

600
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,542
Say Shri Sukta mantra, say of Ganapati Atharva Sheersha.

601
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,125
Put.

602
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,999
It is correct.

603
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,792
Let them do it.

604
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:25,542
No hands. Hold here.

605
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,792
Now is so, all the men here,

606
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,667
first remove this here,

607
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,875
and tell them to wash My feet.

608
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,166
Put water on the feet and wash them.

609
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,709
Say Shri Sukta.

610
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,709
Put! Remove it.

611
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,542
Do not put hand. Remove this, in that dish.

612
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,999
This kumkum is very good because it's been vibrated.

613
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,875
You all should take a little bit

614
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,041
give with a spoon to everyone later on.

615
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,458
Do not touch with your hands.

616
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:59,583
Just bring water, not hot water.

617
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,834
Puja should be done with silence and peace of mind.

618
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:44,834
Nothing will go wrong.

619
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,375
Now you see they did not use the word poverty; alakshmi!

620
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,041
that means what is not Lakshmi Principle -

621
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,166
that they did not say daridrya (poverty) word.

622
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,208
They did not say destroy daridrya, but they said alakshmi.

623
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,750
See how subtle it is.

624
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,834
All that is inauspicious,

625
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,959
that which is not in the Lakshmi Principle,

626
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,166
all that - it covers a vast domain.

627
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:13,750
This all is written after a lot of study

628
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:17,417
- with clear and proper thinking.

629
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:21,834
See the vibrations of it.

630
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,041
Oh, not into that.

631
00:55:57,709 --> 00:56:01,333
Earlier there was water in it, isn't it?

632
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:05,917
Do it now; what can we do, now it has happened.

633
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,166
That is what I was saying.

634
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:15,125
Now pour it, now is no use, there is no difference.

635
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,583
Now do it like this,

636
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,959
listen to Me now.

637
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:25,667
Put water on My feet, and keep it aside

638
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,999
without touching the water.

639
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:16,959
From Kamal it goes to Vishwa, nothing in between!

640
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,041
Did you understand it?

641
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,417
The description of the Mahalakshmi,

642
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,041
that She is very fond of lotus,

643
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,333
and then She is fond of the whole universe.

644
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,458
Nothing in between!

645
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,750
Rub it on your hands.

646
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:58,917
Now start hundred-and-eight names.

647
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,625
Do you still have something on Shri Mahalakshmi?

648
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,291
And this is the thing one should understand,

649
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:47,417
that Mahalakshmi Tattwa becomes the Viratangana,

650
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,166
means the Buddhi, the brain

651
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:56,875
- the awareness, we should say, She becomes that.

652
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,291
Narayani Shakti, or we say Viratangana

653
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,875
is the power of Virata in the brain.

654
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,709
So lastly is the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi -

655
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:11,959
central nervous system is Mahalakshmi Tattwa also, in a way.

656
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,250
I'm just explaining to him,

657
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,458
what happens is this Mahalakshmi Principle

658
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:40,500
starts after the Lakshmi Tattwa has been manifested itself:

659
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,709
means when the Lakshmi has been shown through affluence

660
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,333
and the satisfaction of affluence,

661
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,709
then the Mahalakshmi Principle starts developing in us,

662
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,667
that we think of our ascent.

663
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,083
Then it happens that,

664
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,709
that in our brain we have three Powers

665
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,834
- is Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati

666
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,583
- above the Agnya Chakra.

667
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:03,583
There it so happens that two Powers,

668
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:08,375
is Mahakali and Mahasaraswati, they are blessed by,

669
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:13,000
they are blessed by the Mahalakshmi Principle.

670
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,458
And Mahalakshmi Principle is basically

671
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:19,917
the Principle of Narayana. Narayana is the Vishnu;

672
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,000
and Vishnu becomes Shri Krishna.

673
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,667
And this Shri Krishna Shakti which is here

674
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:28,125
becomes Virata's Shakti there - that is Viratangana.

675
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,917
But when She mixes up with these two,

676
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,999
then the Mahamaya Power starts manifesting,

677
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,542
because She's - you know how Krishna was,

678
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:39,250
He always used to play tricks, this that,

679
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,125
hide this, do this, do

680
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:43,750
- all those things start at this Power.

681
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,709
So that's why it is not so starkingly open.

682
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,999
Like the Mahakali Power is so open;

683
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:53,291
Mahalakshmi Power is a, is a hidden Power, like Mary.

684
01:06:53,999 --> 01:06:56,625
Nobody could have believed that Mary could be Mahalakshmi

685
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:57,959
or Radha or Sita:

686
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,500
simple, hidden away, but very powerful.

687
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,333
But at the time of the Sahasrara it becomes Mahamaya.

688
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:09,583
People don't know how to find out the reality

689
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:14,208
of the Adi Shakti. Do you follow that?

690
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,458
She is the one who sustains the whole Universe

691
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,250
and She becomes the Spirit,

692
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,625
the Spirit of the whole Vishwa,

693
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,000
which Vishwa Gyaneshwara has written.

694
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,667
He has said, Vishwatmake Devi

695
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,458
- the God of the whole Spirit of the Universe.

696
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:40,125
So She becomes the Universe then.

697
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,166
We can have two foreigner men and two foreigner ladies

698
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:28,792
can come up, who are married.

699
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,959
You shouldn't come, Richard, of all the persons.

700
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:40,959
Please be seated.

701
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,792
You'll always have a chance.

702
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,125
Those who cannot get this chance should come.

703
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,834
He's the first one to get up, I told you.

704
01:11:54,834 --> 01:11:56,917
Please sit down.

705
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,875
Not from England, because English people

706
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,542
get a chance always, please.

707
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:06,000
Must be from Australia or some places

708
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,583
where they don't get a chance.

709
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,792
English people should give a chance to others.

710
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:12,250
You meet Me so often, you are there and wash the feet.

711
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:13,583
Come along.

712
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,542
Where is her husband? He's English, is he?

713
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,250
May God bless you. All right.

714
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,125
So get some Australian people.

715
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:24,999
Even if, I mean, you are not married to the same lady,

716
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,417
is not necessary.

717
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,999
But some Australians or Austrians or some people

718
01:12:29,417 --> 01:12:31,083
who do not get a chance.

719
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,792
Spanish is good. All right. May God bless you.

720
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:54,999
English are the most privileged people I should say,

721
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,208
aren't they?

722
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,625
The feet you want to rub? You have never rubbed My feet?

723
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,417
All right, come along.

724
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:50,333
Now, hold it with the right hand, rub it with the left.

725
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:54,291
You have rubbed it - My feet, haven't you?

726
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:57,625
You have rubbed. And you have rubbed My feet?

727
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:00,166
Have you rubbed My feet?

728
01:14:03,542 --> 01:14:05,542
Have you rubbed My feet with water?

729
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:08,625
You have done it, all right, then let him do it.

730
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:37,667
See now the vibrations. You put your hands there.

731
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:44,667
Better now? All right.

732
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,792
May God bless you all.

733
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,333
May God bless you all.

734
01:54:46,834 --> 01:54:49,250
May God bless you all.

735
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:57,417
May God bless you all.
