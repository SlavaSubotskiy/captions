1
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,600
For the last so many lectures

2
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
we have been saying

3
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,840
that you cannot pay for God’s Love.

4
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,720
It makes Me laugh sometimes.

5
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,960
Human beings can never understand Him,

6
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,880
because they live in a very limited sphere.

7
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,760
His Love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited.

8
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,880
Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite”

9
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
we do not understand

10
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
because we have not known anything like that.

11
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,040
And to say that something is genuine

12
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,080
is also like certifying something that is genuine.

13
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
You don’t need a certificate.

14
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,960
Even that human beings don't understand.

15
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,680
We live with artificiality,

16
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,800
we try to find the truth,

17
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,880
again we accept artificiality as truth.

18
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,000
Again we go on fighting.

19
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,960
Then we think this is the truth.

20
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing

21
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,480
or some sort of a mental projection.

22
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,080
All these limited endeavours of human beings

23
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
and the experiences they have

24
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,720
made him

25
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,120
so conditioned,

26
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,600
that it is not easy to understand God.

27
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,640
He made all this universe in His compassion and love.

28
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,720
He created you as human beings, also in His compassion and love.

29
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
He doesn’t need anything.

30
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,720
But He loves.

31
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,960
And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any these things,

32
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,120
without any reward,

33
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,880
just love because for love’s sake.

34
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,080
We can’t think of one human being like that, who can love

35
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
only for love’s sake.

36
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Only after realization,

37
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,040
as you grow more and more, you realize

38
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
that loving is the greatest joy.

39
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,480
And then you cannot think of money in relation to it.

40
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,960
It's something, you'll say but, I think,

41
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
even to say this,

42
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,560
"we don't need money or we don't take money" it's rather

43
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
so low level.

44
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
It's so, so much gross.

45
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,960
Because money and all these concepts are so low.

46
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,760
He didn't make this world to get any fruits out of it.

47
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
Nothing.

48
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,960
He just made it because He loved.

49
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
He wanted to express His Love.

50
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,960
Just to manifest that Love, He made this world.

51
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,480
There’s nothing else expected

52
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
and to put the human mind at that level

53
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,960
is an impossibility, I find, in the beginning.

54
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,720
But gradually they start understanding

55
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,960
how forgiving He is,

56
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,960
how kind He is, how nice He is.

57
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
So the first problem I have to face in the West always

58
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,760
even in Paris this was the problem that I faced

59
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,920
was that human beings feel guilty.

60
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,560
And this guilt is such a big problem in the West,

61
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,560
I just don't understand.

62
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,560
You see, why do you feel guilty so much,

63
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,680
as that is one of the hurdles of Sahaja Yoga, I've seen,

64
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
that people start feeling guilty.

65
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,520
To such an extent

66
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,800
that they don't believe that they can get realization.

67
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,560
They think they are sinners born, outright,

68
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,960
permanently, branded as sinners,

69
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,440
and they can never take their realization.

70
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,600
I mean, just a brand.

71
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,520
It's beyond self pity also,

72
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,520
I would say it's even self-destructive.

73
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
Today I've taken up this subject of left Vishuddhi,

74
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,720
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject,

75
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,640
that this is absolutely,

76
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,520
not inteligible to God that you are

77
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,760
guilty. For what?

78
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Guilty for what are you?

79
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,760
If you ask yourself, you'll say, "Oh, we are guilty,

80
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,560
because we've crucified Christ" at the most.

81
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,480
That is the maximum guilt a human being, let's say, on his head.

82
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,680
"We crucified Christ, we tortured all the

83
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,920
saints". All right.

84
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
But by being guilty what do you get?

85
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,760
Do you get Him back, can you go back and correct that situation?

86
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,480
You cannot.

87
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,960
But harping upon that you do get into your subconscious mind.

88
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,560
You get into a position where you are no more normal to see

89
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,600
the Love of God.

90
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,640
You recede into a corner of your mind,

91
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,560
which is darkness,

92
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,960
which is ignorant, which is blindness,

93
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,960
where you cannot receive that beautiful reign,

94
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
that eternal

95
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,960
flow,

96
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,960
that's coming in.

97
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,440
You hide yourself, at the back,

98
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
and then you say,

99
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
"What about the sun?

100
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I cannot receive it because I don't deserve it."

101
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,960
Behind all this ego orientation in the West....

102
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, I think, I wish they were purely egoistical. They are not.

103
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,480
All this ego recedes back,

104
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,000
into that little pouch, what we call the guilt.

105
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,800
You say something to someone.

106
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
It's not to say that point, that stage,

107
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
that "I've said it. All right, I've said it.

108
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I can take the responsability, it is good." Not.

109
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,960
But you come back coward, "Oh, I should not have said that".

110
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,880
So you wobble between one

111
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,760
kind of action into another kind,

112
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,080
from say, into an aggressive

113
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,960
to another one, for this is the time.

114
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,960
And this wobbling really,

115
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
is very, very troublesome.

116
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,800
It can go on too much.

117
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,480
The oscilation could be so much.

118
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,680
that it can make you absolutely frantic,

119
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
diffident, and sometimes, useless.

120
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,480
On the contrary,

121
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
God wants to find human beings,

122
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,720
who are cheerful people,

123
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,680
who are happy people,

124
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,480
who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

125
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,040
The most unhappy animal in this world,

126
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,720
is the human being, can you believe it?

127
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Animals, don't know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

128
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,880
But the most unhappy human being,

129
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,680
and the most complicated human being,

130
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,040
he has become so over you see, self-destructive,

131
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,920
that the destruction force is built within himself.

132
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
Now think,

133
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,440
of that force that has built you up into a human

134
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,680
how with care and love,

135
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,680
without your knowledge, without troubling.

136
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,720
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain,

137
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,960
of the birth. Your mother [took over it].

138
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,800
He's made you a human being.

139
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
So carefully, delicately He built you up.

140
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
For what?

141
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,880
What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

142
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
Why the flowers start hitting itself?

143
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

144
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,440
This is the worst disease, which

145
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,040
we in the West suffer.

146
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,680
French there's,

147
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
we had at least double the number of people

148
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,880
that we have here today, surprisingly.

149
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,600
But, also they have the same problem,

150
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,920
and I think all their psychologists,

151
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
psychoanalists,

152
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,040
or we can say the, all the books,

153
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
all the writers, their philosophers,

154
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,920
everyone has [unclear] to them.

155
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,960
They have given these ideas,

156
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
and everybody accepts them.

157
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,720
And they curse themselves morning till evening,

158
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,480
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

159
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
When you ask them, they will say,

160
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,520
"Mother we are very unhappy people".

161
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
It's like asking unhappiness

162
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,760
to come and decorate you.

163
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,520
But it has a subtler meaning,

164
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
of which people are not aware.

165
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
These are the times,

166
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,720
when you have to get your realization.

167
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,440
This mass realization has to work out.

168
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
It's all prophesized,

169
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,840
and very modern times are these.

170
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,800
All the stars are acting to help us.

171
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,800
The whole universe is helping us.

172
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,080
All the elements are helping us.

173
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
We are on the stage.

174
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,960
But when the actors arrive on the stage,

175
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,560
they are finished, they can't act.

176
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,560
They can't do anything, they can't play their game.

177
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,600
They are so involved in their different roles.

178
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,880
And that is why one has to understand the subtler of the topic,

179
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,440
then only you will get rid of this guilt.

180
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
You are playing into the hands of negative forces.

181
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,040
They are

182
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,480
not less than any atomic bombs,

183
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,520
built within yourselves.

184
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,080
Now what is the main thing works out,

185
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,400
I think people do not realize.

186
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,720
It's a very subtle method.

187
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,560
Let's see the atomic bomb,

188
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,840
hidrogen bomb, what do we do then?

189
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
They will separate something which should not be separated.

190
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,480
We break

191
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,480
atom, which is not divisible,

192
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
into its divisible parts.

193
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
So we put a pressure

194
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,880
to break them.

195
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
And when that breaking force,

196
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,600
that's aggression I would say,

197
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
is worked out,

198
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,720
that becomes another destructive force.

199
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
So whatever effort we have put into that,

200
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
multiplies, it's not the same force.

201
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,880
And that's we use for our destruction.

202
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,840
I mean it's only human beings can do,

203
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,960
to create things to destroy others.

204
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,760
But this force, which works within our minds,

205
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,840
within ourselves, within our being,

206
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,800
where we actually really hate ourselves sometimes I feel,

207
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,480
the way we are destroying ourselves,

208
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,080
this force

209
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,040
we build within ourselves thanks to  many

210
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,720
nonsensical writers, their conditionings,

211
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,440
and people with wrong conditionings, create conditioning much worse.

212
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,040
We should be singing and chanting like a bird.

213
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,840
We should be loving and enjoying like a flower.

214
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
But I find human beings,

215
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,840
all, looking so very unhappy.

216
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,840
What's the reason?

217
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,560
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

218
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,760
the being that integrates you. You are completely desintegrated.

219
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,876
When you desintegrate the

220
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,880
hidrogen

221
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,960
atom,

222
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,720
you form a very big force built into it.

223
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,760
In the same way you are the seed

224
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,480
integrated in your being.

225
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side

226
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,600
your spiritual being on another side, there's no integrity point to.

227
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,680
And when you cannot

228
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,840
feel that integration,

229
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,800
you feel guilty,

230
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,680
but that guilt is just a symptom of

231
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,920
a very big destructive force built in you.

232
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,800
This, is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

233
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,560
Nor do we,

234
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,440
our destruction is not going to come to us from outside.

235
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,520
That can be controlled.

236
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,560
It's going to come from within,

237
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,960
within ourselves.

238
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,960
Everything we do now, after desintegration,

239
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,600
it's further desintegration,

240
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,480
or further buiding up that negative force within ourselves.

241
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,080
But integrated,

242
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,960
to make you feel complete integration with all your being,

243
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,680
it's only possible

244
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
if you can somehow other

245
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,480
get to that integrating force

246
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,920
which is still there and it's quite deep.

247
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,840
That's the last chance I would say now, that has to work.

248
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
The way the negative forces have set in motion

249
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,760
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

250
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
you don't know what darkness is there.

251
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,520
And to fight it, what one has to do

252
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,720
is to bring that light of the spirit,

253
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,800
which integrates.

254
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,960
The darkness always desintegrates.

255
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
For example there's complete darkness, all right?

256
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
I can't feel you, I don't know who you are, where you are sitting.

257
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
We are all separate.

258
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,000
I can't see you, I don't know who you people are there.

259
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,480
I wouldn't know where is the window, where is the door.

260
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,680
I hold this and say: "This is the truth".

261
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
All desintegrated personalities,

262
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
and desintegrated people,

263
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,880
always see aberrations. They see different things,

264
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,960
different auras, different things.

265
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Now, this is a very vicious circle.

266
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
You should think of it.

267
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,960
There's a very great vicious circle we have.

268
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,120
The vicious circle is

269
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,600
that

270
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,800
we try to think about it,

271
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,760
which is limited.

272
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
Supposing I have a limited vision, there's darkness

273
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,040
what will I feel?

274
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,000
You start thinking about it and thinking about it,

275
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
pondering over you.

276
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,720
The more you think about it the worse it becomes.

277
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,080
Another way, could be people who may try to solve this problem,

278
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,000
who think that we are desintegrated,

279
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,000
is to talk of big things "we are all brothers and sisters",

280
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,560
"Let's form U.N. counseling",

281
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,120
"Let's do world organization".

282
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,400
All blind people doing world organization will end up

283
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,480
at the most at the labour,

284
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,880
what you call, labour department.

285
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,560
That's all.

286
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,040
With all these

287
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,040
institutions working in the big name,

288
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
where are we?

289
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Actually when we become

290
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,960
aware, we don't need them.

291
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
We don't need at all.

292
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,520
So this awareness is nothing but

293
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
it is the light of the spirit within you which is missing.

294
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,680
The spirit is watching you, all right.

295
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,520
It goes up to a point

296
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,480
to see your stupidity and your limitedness.

297
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,520
And it goes up to a very great extent I should say,

298
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,120
It's finished.

299
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,760
It disappears when a person dies,

300
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,800
or he gets into trouble, he becomes creazy, mad,

301
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
whatever you may call him.

302
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,000
He develops other diseases like cancer,

303
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,520
which are caused by another problem here, as you know, Ekadesha.

304
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,120
So these forces are built within us,

305
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
of the negativity,

306
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,800
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

307
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,120
So in the Kundalini Shastra,

308
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,840
we can say that the left and right side

309
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
when used too much,

310
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,800
you build up these forces in the head of eleven Rudras,

311
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the eleven distructive forces.

312
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,680
A cancer patient develops it.

313
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,760
But even before developing cancer people can develop it.

314
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,600
And there are so many things,

315
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,760
that can create this,

316
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,640
that sometimes one could feel, in this vicious circle that

317
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,000
that how are you going to [unclear] the whole society.

318
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,800
And there's only one thing,

319
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,880
that will save the situation, is Self-realization.

320
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,960
All other things are destroying,

321
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,760
are absolutely confusing.

322
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,960
But there's only one thing if you can do,

323
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,960
that saves the whole, like putting on the light, finished.

324
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,480
But people don't understand the importance,

325
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,920
of Self-realization, because some people ask Me

326
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,640
"What's the use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?"

327
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Now, see the big canvas of the whole thing, the whole cosmos,

328
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,920
whereas you are a party.

329
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,760
See what's happening to human beings today,

330
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,760
and if they are to be saved,

331
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
no use being unhappy.

332
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,000
Like in France they said, "You cannot,

333
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,640
Mother, say, you are very happy person".

334
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,880
I said, "Why?"

335
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Because that means you are ignorant,

336
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
of the shocks."

337
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,440
See, I have to say, I am here,

338
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,720
I have to paint some lines here to show you,

339
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,400
that I'm very deeply concerned,

340
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,520
worried about the world.

341
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,960
But what is the solution have you got?

342
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,520
You want Me to be like you only?

343
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,040
Is that the solution?

344
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,600
That if ten people are weeping you also join them weeping?

345
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,480
Is that the solution?

346
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,080
And the...

347
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,080
one and only method that we have

348
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,080
which has been already told, prescribed, and

349
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,960
has been prophesized,

350
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,680
nobody seeks it.

351
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,840
No one seeks the truth.

352
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,560
See now, in the Bible, you have to be born again,

353
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
Christ to be born in your heart.

354
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,120
I mean they do it even before solving the whole drama

355
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,680
they do it by giving you the second birth,

356
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,480
by Christening so called.

357
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,600
Hindus they believe without yoga is there's no sense.

358
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,520
"Yoga kshema vahamyam". Krishna said. "All the time that you seek

359
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,800
yoga, what are you seeking?"

360
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
All these treatise and all these big books

361
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,040
and all the scriptures are aiming at what?

362
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,560
Even, those who talk you must live with Dharma [?]

363
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,520
give you bad ideas. For what?

364
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,920
Why do you do it?

365
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
What is the destination?

366
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,960
And the destination is the spirit.

367
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,760
And today

368
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,440
the background is so black, is so dark,

369
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
that this solution is

370
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,680
the end of everything.

371
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,840
But do we realize it?

372
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,920
On the contrary the vicious circle builts in, within us

373
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,640
all the time.

374
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,960
"Oh, see how the world is miserable.

375
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,880
Then how can I be happy?

376
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,720
I'm so unhappy in life."

377
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm yet to come across a person before realization

378
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,880
saying that, "I am a happy person".

379
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,760
Maybe is ego-oriented.

380
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
People might say, "I'm happy, meaning my ego is

381
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,920
you see, if he goes in a certain car,

382
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,600
or something like that, he's very happy, on top of the world.

383
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,920
After ten minutes, you see him...

384
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,480
and this vicious circle is set in.

385
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,960
This ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

386
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,400
Another vicious circle and another vicious circle

387
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,920
and another vicious circle, we go on

388
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,640
from one to another,

389
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,600
moving on the wheels after wheels

390
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
without realizing that where we are going.

391
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,880
And this vicious circle has to be broken

392
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,840
by one faith,

393
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,000
by one understanding,

394
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,000
that God is forgiveness.

395
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
God is Love.

396
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
When we feel love for anyone,

397
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,000
without any lust and greed,

398
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,560
then that is God’s Love within us.

399
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,640
That He is the embodiment

400
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,560
of that pure Love,

401
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,840
which just loves,

402
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
which has given you this beautiful human life

403
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,560
and wants to make you more beautiful.

404
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,920
He created all this creation for you

405
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,800
and that He wants to enjoy the bounteousness of this creation.

406
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,440
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of His Realm

407
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,440
and the Kingdom of His Grace.

408
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,120
Do we go to see someone

409
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,960
who is highly placed, with a morose face? Do we?

410
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,920
That day we'll specially brush up the hair,

411
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,520
see, make our hair into a beautiful thing,

412
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,120
make our face nice,

413
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,960
dress up well. It looks that we are well, you see.

414
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
That’s outside.

415
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,600
Inside, if you just feel how kind He is,

416
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,480
how He has

417
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,560
worked out meticulously

418
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
in this blissful life of a human being.

419
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,520
But think how much He has done for you.

420
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,760
Instead of that, if you are all good type to say,

421
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,080
“I am very unhappy in life.”

422
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,720
I mean, think of the One who does everything for you

423
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
and you can just come back saying,

424
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,720
“Oh, I am a very unhappy person.”

425
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,480
What is He going to feel about it?

426
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,480
No gratitude.

427
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,960
Count your blessings one by one.

428
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,960
That’s what one has to do,

429
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,640
is to have

430
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,960
complete understanding that He is

431
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,920
God Almighty.

432
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,480
He can do anything that He likes.

433
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,440
and we are

434
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,960
the recipient of His Allmighty.

435
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
He is the Ocean of Love,

436
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,960
and we are the recipient of His Love.

437
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Let us feel that, within ourselves,

438
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,480
and understand logically with wisdom.

439
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,640
If this sets into your mind,

440
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,840
that’s the best conditioning I think human beings can have,

441
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
what you call in Sanskrit as  "Susamskara",

442
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,560
means the auspicious conditionings.

443
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,920
You see, we don't have only conditioning and ego.

444
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,520
We have third thing called also good conditioning.

445
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,960
The conditionings that are ruining your chances of enjoyment,

446
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,920
let it be brought round.

447
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
And see for yourself, logically you can see

448
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,520
how much is done for.

449
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,560
I mean none of the animals were that comfortable and [enjoying].

450
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
They don't know the idea of comfort. I mean they have never had car,

451
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
even chairs to sit.

452
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,760
It's easy to say, "nice to be like animals".

453
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,400
See, but just go and see the way they live poor things, you know.

454
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,680
Even the king of the forest, how he lives, one should go and see.

455
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,480
But he's happy.

456
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,800
He's full of joy.

457
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
How has to kill an animal, he'll kill it,

458
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,600
if it is dignity eat

459
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,600
one or two days, finish. Then,

460
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,760
he lives for ten days without food.

461
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,120
Whenever he feels hungry he goes, he's not bothered.

462
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,400
He doesn't feel guilty for killing anybody,

463
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,880
he is hungry, has to eat, he eats, finished.

464
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
But human beings as they are,

465
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,920
they will eat someone without the need,

466
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,880
and they'll feel guilty.

467
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,680
This is the problem.

468
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,480
He has made you in His own image.

469
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,760
He's done everything beautifully.

470
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,520
After realization you start understanding yourself

471
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
and enjoying yourself as you enjoy others.

472
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,720
The fragrance of others you start enjoying.

473
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,040
Self-realization is the only way,

474
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,760
you can get the light in.

475
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,080
Enlightenment. Everybody talks of enlightenment, enlightenment.

476
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,080
Enlightened means, means for some people is that you start jumping.

477
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,640
Is it enlightenement to be abnormal like that?

478
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,760
Or take out your clothes?

479
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,560
I mean, just think of it, I mean how does it go into your brains,

480
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,720
I can't understand, that doing all these nonsensical things,

481
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,000
how can there be enlightenment?

482
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
Or taking to alcohol, drinking or

483
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,680
drugs or anything. How can that give you enlightenment?

484
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Has it given to anyone so far?

485
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,600
It might be some sort of a funny strnge experience  you might get,

486
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,040
but not enlightenment.

487
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,680
In enlightenment you get integrated,

488
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,400
you see your way through, you know where you are standing

489
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,640
and how you are moving in relationship to others.

490
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,520
So the illogical method,

491
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,440
I would say, unwise method, the way we deal with life,

492
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,640
becomes a kind, of a, possession.

493
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
and we are possessed by this negative force which is eating us up.

494
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
And we want to live in with that idea,

495
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,880
enjoing that idea,

496
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,720
that we are miserable people

497
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,440
we are unhappy,

498
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,440
we are helpless. I mean I've seen people sitting on the streets,

499
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,880
and discussing, "Oh, thank God, there's going to be

500
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,920
eight stars coming in, we'll be all destroyed". I mean just imagine.

501
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
But we have to think about the One who has created us.

502
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,000
Is He waiting for your destruction, will He be happy with that?

503
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,760
How much are you cooperating with Him?

504
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,960
With what?

505
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,560
Care, love He has created us with what hopes for the livings?

506
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,600
What does He want to do for us?

507
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
That you are sitting down and feeling guilty.

508
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,680
And now, I have to tell openly,

509
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,800
that it has come to you also through other vechicles,

510
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,600
apart from the psychologists, psychoanalysts.

511
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,920
Psychoanalysts, the other day we had a girl,

512
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,560
she came to see Me.

513
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
She's French, her English was wonderful,

514
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,440
and she said,

515
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,680
"Horrible psychologists, they make me mad."

516
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,720
"Why?" She said, "I have bad relationship with my mother,

517
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,560
I have bad relationship with my father,

518
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,640
bad relationship with every third person.

519
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,920
I don't have that, absolutely pure relationship.

520
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,920
They try to put that idea into my head

521
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,520
that there's something abnormal, pathological about me

522
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,880
which I am not.

523
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
And they are making my brother's relationship also

524
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,760
funny by telling him that I have bad relations with him.

525
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,960
This is it.

526
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,880
So hit at the point to pure love.

527
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,800
Desintegrate,

528
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,760
You can't have good relationship with your own mother,

529
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,520
with your own father, with your own sister, with your brother,

530
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,680
and nobody, because you cannot love except for, you are sex points.

531
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,120
You have just relationship of sex.

532
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,760
Even animals have better relationship then we have,

533
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,040
if you have to accept the psychologists.

534
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
And they take money

535
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,560
to suggest all these nonsensical ideas into your head.

536
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,800
There are some here sitting. I will face them later on.

537
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,400
This is how they put in ideas into your heads

538
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,560
that you are a person who has no,

539
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960
no purity,

540
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,000
and that you are a sinner,

541
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,760
you are a damned person and any person you look upon,

542
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,760
you have only sex relationships, no feelings.

543
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
I mean are you sex points?

544
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,760
With all this evolution God has made us into

545
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,760
a sex point that's what we have done to ourselves.

546
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,480
Reduced ourselves to that point only.

547
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,840
He has created you in your own glory and in your own dignity.

548
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,840
He's not created you

549
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,480
to be only wasted like this

550
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,440
Then the second thing that desintegrates us very much more,

551
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,720
is the idea,

552
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,960
that we are here, you see,

553
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,800
to live in a gross way,

554
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,440
somehow fighting,

555
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,960
political, economic,

556
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,120
all these nonsensical,

557
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,960
progress that we are making.

558
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,720
And everything is explained,

559
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,560
all destructive forces are explained in the name

560
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,760
of political or economic growth.

561
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,600
I don't know if it is growth or whatever it is,

562
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,680
but definetely it is not love, take it from Me.

563
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
It is not love.

564
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,960
That's why economics of God is to be understood.

565
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,600
Politics of God is to be understood.

566
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,440
And for human beings to understand they must have Self-realization.

567
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,120
Innate economics,

568
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,680
generosity is the key note.

569
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,680
He enjoys His generosity.

570
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,880
Material things are to express your generosity, isn't it?

571
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,640
What are they for?

572
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,760
The most enjoyable thing is to give,

573
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
and when you give,

574
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
you will think your economic

575
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,640
problems will be solved completely.

576
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,680
Because you are here to live, not to take,- no problems.

577
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,560
The problems are because you want to grab.

578
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,440
And once you start giving you get it,

579
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,120
as much as you want, because

580
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,960
if there's no outlet,

581
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,880
there's no joy, there's no happiness, there's no release.

582
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,800
from the material domination on you.

583
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,080
But giving is the way

584
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,080
you can get rid of that material domination on your head.

585
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,960
That you give away.

586
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,760
Give away everything that you have

587
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,840
and you'll be surprised how it works.

588
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,600
Now, when I say, it is fantastic the way it acts.

589
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,720
Fantastic, the way it acts.

590
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,440
The way, I mean it's easy to sort of say that,

591
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,480
"It's Mother saying something,

592
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,760
which is,

593
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,880
something miraculous."

594
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,440
But what do you think of Moses crossing the river, crossing the sea?

595
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,440
You mean, it was miraculous,

596
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,440
or it was a false stoy or what do you think of it?

597
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,000
It was absolutely true,

598
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,920
that he did cross

599
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,960
the sea with the help of God, he could do it.

600
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,800
What about Christ walking on the water?

601
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,560
He did because by His nature He did it.

602
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,680
What about all the miracles that were done by this Incarnation?

603
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,840
It's absolutely true, I'm here to prove all of them.

604
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,560
But you must get your realization.

605
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,640
It's not because that I cannot prove it.

606
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,560
You must enter into that realm of awareness

607
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,560
otherwise I cannot prove it.

608
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,440
It's true, the other day somebody was saying that Rama is a fiction.

609
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,880
I said, "How do you say?"

610
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,600
He said, "Because He looks like a fiction".

611
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,000
I said, "To human mind they cannot understand God,

612
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,760
who has

613
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,480
millions and millions of hands and eyes

614
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,960
to work out His plans."

615
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,680
So naturally Rama is a fiction, Krishna is a fiction,

616
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,720
everybody is a fiction.

617
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,680
Because we ourselves are fictitious I think.

618
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,080
Is not that it is a fiction but we are

619
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,840
incapable of grasping that is miraculous, which is divine.

620
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,600
and that's why we just call it, "Oh".

621
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,760
No, everything is true, believe Me, everything is true.

622
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Now, Rama, say, [simplest of them].

623
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
Simple being, like Rama, all right?

624
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,640
Rama is a fiction.

625
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,760
Many, even Indians are very anglicised now,

626
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,760
very westernized you see,

627
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,840
so they want to say, "We don't believe in all these fictions",

628
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,760
so they become English.

629
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,560
For them to become English is the last epitome, it's the last world.

630
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
So we don't believe in Rama, nothing, we say, "All right,

631
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,440
it's all other, old style everything."

632
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,960
But He exists and He's within us.

633
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,880
Can we prove it?

634
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,920
With your Kundalini awakening.

635
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,600
If a person who has got asthma.

636
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,480
who suffers from asthma,

637
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
catches on the right heart,

638
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,960
you have to take the name of Rama,

639
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,040
to cure him.

640
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,960
Nothing else can cure him.

641
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,960
The simplest thing.

642
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,680
The Kundalini stops here.

643
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,520
Many people don't believe in Christ.

644
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,520
"We don't believe in Christ",[?] you don't believe in Christ

645
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,960
but under what circumstaces? Why, why don't you believe in Christ?

646
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,600
Because you see, we don't think He existed, how can it be possible?

647
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,760
"We don't believe in Moses, we don't believe in Christ,

648
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,800
we don't believe in anybody", all right.

649
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,960
Do you believe in yourself?

650
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,920
Perhaps that is missing.

651
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,800
Because the Self is not there.

652
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,080
If you know your Self you should believe in Him.

653
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,520
Because when Kundalini rises, at this point you'll be amazed,

654
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,560
at this point, whether you believe in Christ or not,

655
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,560
at this point,

656
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,680
at the Agnya chakra, where you see the crossing of it,

657
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,960
you have to say Lord's Prayer.

658
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,880
You have to take the name of Christ

659
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,560
otherwise Kundalini doesn't rise.

660
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,520
Now most of the people who are here, who are realized, know this.

661
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,480
It has been proved to them.

662
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,560
In the Nabhi, in this Void, if it is catching,

663
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,120
you have to take the name of Moses.

664
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,560
Whether you are a Jew or not, or a hater of Jews

665
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,720
or whatever you may be.

666
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,760
You'll have to take the name of a Jew,

667
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,760
of Moses.

668
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,120
The whole movement of the Kundalini

669
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,680
is to intergrate all the truths which are

670
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,640
treated as miraculous, some people think it's falsehood,

671
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,920
it's good for nothing, useless,

672
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,880
all these things are proved by the

673
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,480
movement of the Kundalini in your central path.

674
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,000
And the greatest of greatest thing that is proved,

675
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,680
is that God exists.

676
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Not only exists but He's active,

677
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,760
that He does everything for us,

678
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,000
that it is He who is the truth and is His Power [Almighty],

679
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,600
He's the truth, the rest is all falsehood and nonsense.

680
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,760
It works in all details too, in small details also.

681
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,440
Now Sahaja Yogis have seen the miracles in Sahaja Yoga,

682
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,440
they cannot complain.

683
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,960
You cannot complain also.

684
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,720
When you will come here, [I mean] you are surprised

685
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,680
how you are helped, how you meet people,

686
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,960
how you get to things, how things work out,

687
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,960
and how it works out so smoothly, you just can't imagine.

688
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,880
Even to the smallest detail you can work out,

689
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,960
beautifully,

690
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,720
but you have to establish yourself in the kingdom of God.

691
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
Not with this fanatical ideas, like you go to the Catholic church

692
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,480
and they say, "Now you must confess".

693
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,720
I don't know from where did they get this idea.

694
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,480
I don't think Christ could ever said that

695
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,040
to better go and confess to these priests,

696
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,640
who are not even realized souls.

697
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
What are they going to do by confession?

698
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,440
And then the answer came to Me from a priest.

699
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,760
I've asked him, he's a nice man, he's a realized soul now,

700
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,000
and he is working for Sahaja Yoga.

701
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,080
But he told Me the reason is in the Bible it's written,

702
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,560
that whatever is corrected in this concern,

703
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,560
will be corrected in the heaven

704
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,760
that's why you better correct it by telling to the priest.

705
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,440
Now, by any logical means do you think these priests

706
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,560
can help you by telling them anything?

707
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,880
Whatever is to be granted on this earth is your Kundalini,

708
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,960
and your Chakras.

709
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,600
The language comparable has been,

710
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,920
specially the Old Testament,

711
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,720
has been extremely,

712
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,000
guarded. It was security measure.

713
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,520
Like the tree of life is nothing

714
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,680
but the Kundalini which is enlightened.

715
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,680
Absolutely that it looks like that, like a tree.

716
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,080
The other day we were having program and today only,

717
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,760
my children showed Me, "Look the Kundalini".

718
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,000
When they saw they were describing about Moses something,

719
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,760
perhaps, and this was the tree of life, they said.

720
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,840
And My children, grandchildren said, "See, the Kundalini".

721
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,600
The language they used may be

722
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
for security measures may be,

723
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,840
but not the word meaning,

724
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,960
if it is now changed by human beings, it's false.

725
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,600
Human beings can change words, that's a different point,

726
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,960
but you can see, in Sahaja Yoga you can see what is changed,

727
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,680
what is wrong, which is falsehood. You can see all these things.

728
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,640
So to desintegrate,

729
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,680
these things are again created in the name of religion, so-called.

730
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,760
I mean these people are there for God or for

731
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,760
making you feel guilty?

732
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,520
Like, say Jews think that Christ was not a saviour,

733
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,960
as they are still waiting for two hundred years. It's not true.

734
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,880
He's the One, without Him you cannot raise the Kundalini.

735
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,880
One should understand that He's the Mahavishnu described.

736
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,760
But if I say something,

737
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,120
that doesn't mean that you should believe Me. Not at all.

738
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,720
But you should see for yourself because if you are interested,

739
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,760
in the emancipation of the whole world,

740
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,960
you should not get stuck on one, I tell you,

741
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,720
stuck on to one thing,

742
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,040
and say "this is the truth and this is the truth".

743
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,080
No, seek for yourself what is the truth.

744
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
And you'll be amazed that they are all one.

745
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,640
Like Christ has said, "Those who are not against Me

746
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,600
are the people who are great".

747
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,640
Moses and Christ are one, which can be proved.

748
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,480
Same in other religions.

749
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,680
So religion is another way desintegrated.

750
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,960
You hate each other. Fundamentalists, fighting for what?

751
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,640
Fundamental difference you know.

752
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,920
Can you imagine? What is the fundamental

753
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,680
of these religions? If they are spirit, isn't it?

754
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,880
Is it that different between the spirit of one and another?

755
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,800
Fundamentalists are...

756
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,760
Their God is one, He's created us

757
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,080
and what are you fighting about?

758
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,120
Fundamental difference you know, fundamental difference,

759
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,880
where there exists no difference at all.

760
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,720
So we have psychologists,

761
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,000
we have religious leaders, teaching us how to fight and hate

762
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,960
God and your fellow being, in the name of God.

763
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,960
This is another desintegrated, that sets into us.

764
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,960
So you people who are thinking,

765
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,120
should understand

766
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,440
that anything that creates such limitation within us

767
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,560
any kind of fanaticism,

768
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,920
is dangerous not only to you but to the whole society,

769
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,760
and if you support it, even this much,

770
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,680
you are supporting their destruction.

771
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,040
With Sahaja Yoga we can establish,

772
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,800
this that anybody who is a fanatic,

773
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,920
has problems and sufferes from many diseases

774
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,760
which normal people don't.

775
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,400
Then there are another type of people who

776
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,480
say that, "All right, we don't believe in God".

777
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,720
Because how can God create this fanaticism?

778
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,760
How can you blame God for fanaticism,

779
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,840
I just can't understand, He never created it.

780
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,000
Actually He never created any difference between you people,

781
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,960
just a variety, just to make it beautiful, that's all.

782
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,760
See, He didn't create England separately, this separately,

783
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,960
to that extent the way you think but He created them

784
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,800
because they are different organs in the body of God.

785
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,040
Do we take out an eye, and say "This is an eye

786
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,960
so I do not have any duty to it". Can we?

787
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
It's like that.

788
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,040
It's simple as that, it's so simple.

789
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,960
The truth is so simple and so stark before you

790
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,080
that we are doing all these things,

791
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
fighting, quarelling,

792
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,760
all the time within ourselves and without.

793
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,640
Now, for that Self-realization,

794
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,880
God has placed this wonderful thing, Kundalini within us,

795
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,960
very beautifully, in the best possible position.

796
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,480
It could not be better anywhere.

797
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,800
To create this happening within us, in our awareness,

798
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,960
the Kundalini has to rise and give us realization.

799
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,040
Now, people ask questions to God also, can be.

800
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,720
They can say, "Why did He do it?

801
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,800
Why didn't He make us wise within Him?"

802
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,520
There are many like that.

803
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,720
He should have just make us wise,

804
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,440
just from monkeys, dipped into some wisdom

805
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,480
powder,and lift us out as

806
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,480
wise people living in the kingdom of God.

807
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,720
Why didn't He do it in our evolution, why did He make us

808
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,000
so stupid?

809
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,880
One can say to God, you see, why, why

810
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,760
did He create these problems, talking to God.

811
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,640
But who are we to ask Him questions. You see, He does what He likes.

812
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,960
But,

813
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,960
there's a reason.

814
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,760
If you have to enter into that complete freedom

815
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,960
you must know how to be free.

816
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,760
If you are just abandoned people, you have no sense of freedom,

817
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,640
you don't know how to be choosy about the good and the bad,

818
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,560
and you do not understand the value

819
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,880
of your own wisdom,

820
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,880
and if you are put in charge, imagine,

821
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,600
some mad people put in charge in government, what will happen?

822
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,120
So you have to grow up to that point

823
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,640
to feel your freedom that in your freedom,

824
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,920
you are great, it's in that freedom,

825
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,960
you are kind, in that freedom.

826
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,960
You are,

827
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,560
absolutely balanced.

828
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,760
And when that happens to you,

829
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,520
then only the higher freedom is given to you.

830
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,520
Because that's completely free.

831
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,680
And once that high freedom comes into you,

832
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,960
then you can feel,

833
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,920
the responsibility, the responsibility,

834
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,880
to be,

835
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,480
responsible for your freedom.

836
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,840
To put this beautiful responsability onto you

837
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,720
you have to know how to use your freedom.

838
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,600
This is only transition which has led all of us,

839
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,760
into this feeling, guiltness,

840
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,520
or this agression. Can you imagine?

841
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,880
You could have waited for a burial,

842
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,840
without feeling so sick.

843
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,520
I mean sometimes I feel the people are

844
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,760
going for a funeral.

845
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,760
the way they look miserable.

846
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,480
The rest are busy, creating such things.

847
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,480
So there are only two types of people, if one sees,

848
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,680
some who are being victims and another who are victimizing also.

849
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,440
So to have the balance in the center, to stand in the center,

850
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
God has created

851
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,920
this little tide where you have to just learn,

852
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,840
how to gain your freedom. He gave you freedom, you know,

853
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,800
and this freedom is the only thing that has created,

854
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,680
all the problems you face, not God. God didn't create,

855
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,680
any problems for you. No, He wanted to make a very smooth ascent.

856
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,920
He's made your machines so beautifully.

857
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,560
Despite all these things you do get your realization, no doubt.

858
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,120
But because of habits you may run down again to it.

859
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,040
Again you will have your ascent, again go down.

860
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,120
It happens to some people, doesn't matter.

861
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,960
But if you are steady, it is going to work out.

862
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,640
It has to work out.

863
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,720
God has to save His creation. He has to do it.

864
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,760
Only thing how many are going to cooperate

865
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,760
and take advantage of His compassion is to be seen.

866
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,800
That is the most important thing, how many are going to be wise,

867
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,480
to see to their own advantage,

868
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,960
to their own ascent.

869
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,440
It's the only choice.

870
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,800
May God bless you.

871
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,120
If you have any questions you may ask Me,

872
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,480
and then we are going to give realization.

873
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,840
Mother, how the negative force is created?

874
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,120
What's it?

875
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,120
How this negative force is created, within?

876
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,920
What is he saying?

877
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,760
How the negative force is created, within us?

878
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,600
By the great human beings.

879
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,960
Who has created atom bomb?

880
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,960
Same type.

881
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,960
From the very begining they started creating this negative force.

882
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,480
All right.

883
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,000
In seeking as I told you, in the seeking,

884
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,960
they settle in this vicious circle

885
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,560
which started creating, and think you see, the mistake is small.

886
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,960
What is the mistake in separating a hydrogen

887
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,680
atom, isn't it?

888
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,400
Just they did it, you see, for fun sake maybe.

889
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,960
I don't know why they did it.

890
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,880
But now it has become like a devil,

891
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,640
sitting on everybody's head and everybody...

892
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,960
"Thank God only, whatever they create frightens them, thank God.

893
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,560
So they are not going to use it, but

894
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,960
who has created that? Human beings.

895
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,800
In ignorance they have done it. As a Mother I have to save.

896
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,800
I cannot say that it was deliberated.

897
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,760
It's a dangerous situation then.

898
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,560
It's obvious, in your life, ten people have created atom bombs.

899
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,960
What was the need?

900
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,840
I mean for a stranger like Me, I don't understand what is the need

901
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,960
to create an atom bomb, what is the need?

902
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,920
Who are them to create this kind of a democracy and this kind of

903
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,760
communism, and this kind of all nonsensical institutions,

904
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,960
which just make the people fight?

905
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,760
Any other questions please?

906
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,000
And you can't blame God for that.

907
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,960
At least God didn't tell you to make atom bombs.

908
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,760
Any other question please?

909
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,680
I have got one.

910
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,480
Yes.

911
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,760
Why do you think, are people

912
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,760
all the time so afraid of losing things,

913
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,720
of losing their ego, of losing their, their relatives, or

914
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,960
but not losing, but

915
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,960
losing their, what they have built up in themselves,

916
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,560
their identity that they think they are.

917
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
They are afraid of losing it.

918
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,920
Why they are afraid?

919
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,880
Yes.

920
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,560
They have been crocked up like that, you know.

921
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,480
They are told like that, they are conditioned like that.

922
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,000
What can they do?

923
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,560
You see, they are all the time, if somebody tells you

924
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,760
that you are going to lose, "it's very precious, very precious",

925
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,960
you see, you'll hold on to it.

926
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,960
But one must know in growth, in life,

927
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,800
when a flower becomes a fruit,

928
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,560
it looses power to fruit, [?]

929
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
to go into it.

930
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,760
When an egg breaks,

931
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,480
its shell falls off and the bird comes out.

932
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,440
It's not a moving, it is growth.

933
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,120
You have been fighting, what can you do?

934
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,120
From the very beginning.

935
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,120
What is there to loose if you are not holding on to anything?

936
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,000
All right?

937
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,640
What is there to lose, you just tell Me?

938
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,760
If the whole is all something,

939
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,120
Then, then, if there's no catch on anything,

940
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,640
what are you going to loose?

941
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,760
You are just enjoing on giving.

942
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,480
What do we take from Him?

943
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,440
When we go our hands are like this,

944
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,640
when we come our hands are like this.

945
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,960
Our hands are open, when we go. We can't take anything we confess it.

946
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,760
Even ego we leave here. Everything we leave here.

947
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,600
All myths, so many myths have been created,

948
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,640
and man is living with the mythical ideas.

949
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,680
I tell you, he's living, he's compromizing with the myth.

950
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,840
All the time, he doesn't accept the myths that means

951
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,760
he is not a sane person.

952
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,800
All sorts of, and then many myths set in.

953
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,640
People start copying others blindly.

954
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,120
All it's, to a

955
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,440
ignorant person like Me,

956
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,920
it's something I just don't understand what is the need.

957
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,880
But I am talking of the real world where you have to be.

958
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,920
It is reality.

959
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,920
And you know reality is love.

960
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,880
It's love.

961
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,960
But not the way human beings understand love.

962
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,480
But love which flows,

963
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,080
which thinks, which cooperates,

964
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,840
and generates the feeling of joy.

965
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,080
It's a very different world that we have to adjust to.

966
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,680
But what will you do?

967
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,080
What have you got?

968
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,960
What you have, that is lost?

969
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,720
That's your spirit.

970
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,960
And what you don't have, you are only born with.

971
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,440
There's nothing to lose. That's very true,

972
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,480
they are so fightened, you don't know.

973
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,560
Very frightened.

974
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,520
They are made like that, what can you do?

975
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,600
But they lose everything to a person

976
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,960
who knows how to handle this condition in the real sense.

977
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,000
You can just become like a cabage with some people.

978
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,960
Really they can make you a cabbage.

979
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,760
In the name of God, in the name of enlightenement, they can.

980
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,840
Yes, they can harm you.

981
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,560
Then they are not worried.

982
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,880
I don't know how they get this confidence into that.

983
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Like the other day we had somebody from Charismatic Movement.

984
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,760
You remember that, Norman.

985
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,560
And I hope you have not taken anything.

986
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,440
Photographer was [?].

987
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,640
You were also worried about him.

988
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,960
And he went into such movements of the body,

989
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,680
for at least half an hour

990
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,520
he was so much in a very funny type of epilepsy, you see.

991
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,440
All his body was moving and

992
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,480
terrible he was crying, weeping

993
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,880
he fell down on the ground, you can't imagine.

994
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,720
And he said, "This I've been doing and so many are doing like this,

995
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,680
and they think they are getting into Holy Ghost".

996
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,720
I said, "Holy Ghost?"

997
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,760
What an unholy thing it is to be like that.

998
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,720
Holy Ghost? Can you imagine?

999
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,920
He wanted to get out of it. He could not.

1000
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,520
Now, he's all right, perfectly all right.

1001
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
He's like a small little child.

1002
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,960
I wish you could see that joy.

1003
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,480
You should have seen it, really.

1004
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,960
Shocking, much more than TM I tell you, much worse.

1005
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,920
Because the movement was so fast.

1006
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,920
[Under they make] very fast movements.

1007
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,880
Whole body was gesticulating and this was too much.

1008
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,600
He got cured.

1009
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,960
Any other question?

1010
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,880
Ego is one problem, I must say it's a very big problem.

1011
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,000
And for ego,

1012
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,680
like some people say,  "Mother, why You should do it?"

1013
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,640
I said, "You better do it, it's very good idea".

1014
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,000
I would like to retire...

1015
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,760
But you can't do it, what to do? See.

1016
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,920
All right, now you do so many things, I don´t feel bad.

1017
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,920
Why should you feel bad if I know something.

1018
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,960
You know one thing I know is to awaken, awakening of the Kundalini.

1019
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,960
Now, what can I do about it?

1020
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,040
Are you going to crucify Me for that?

1021
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,880
I mean I don't get any,

1022
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,480
what you call, title from your government for that,

1023
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,560
you won't pay Me, nothing.

1024
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,760
So why, why should you feel bad?

1025
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,640
I mean I will make you the same way.

1026
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,760
You will raise others Kundalini also.

1027
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,760
So what's the harm?

1028
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,960
You will, of course you are going to do it yourself.

1029
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,400
Supposing I have the keys with Me. If I give you the keys

1030
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,720
will you feel your ego will be hurt or not?

1031
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,640
If I am a trustee I have, I have to give you isn't it?

1032
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,560
Do you feel your ego hurt, if I give you, your keys?

1033
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,960
It's so simple as that.

1034
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,720
This is your own, this is your own property, I've got the keys,

1035
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,680
I give you because I hold them, now what to do?

1036
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,760
If you accept that's very good,

1037
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,880
Nevertheless, so I have to give you.

1038
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,680
What is there to feel hurt about that part?

1039
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,480
Actually I have to work very hard.

1040
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,120
You don't have to work hard at all.

1041
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,480
To begin with, then up to you.

1042
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,960
Any other question?

1043
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,120
I would like Sahaja Yogis to ask the question,

1044
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,640
for one reason, because when they are faced with life, and

1045
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,040
other people will ask the questions,

1046
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,680
so any questions which you have not been able to

1047
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,600
ask, you can ask Me and then we have our realization.

1048
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,560
Mother, what's, what is we are perished,

1049
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,880
for the Christian Church?

1050
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,440
What is it?

1051
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,960
What it's our approach for the Christian Church.

1052
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,920
Have pity for them.

1053
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,960
See I took My birth in the Christian religion in India,

1054
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,760
and first the Hindus, you see, they were very upset

1055
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,760
that "how could She take birth

1056
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,960
in a Christian religion", I mean so called Christian.

1057
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,120
And I must tell you I was baptized forcibly by

1058
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,040
a Lutheran Church.

1059
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,680
All right?

1060
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,480
The simple answer is

1061
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,720
that Christians are the most fanatic.

1062
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,640
And the Indian Christians are the worst

1063
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,960
because they think Christ was born in England.

1064
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,560
Really they think so. You see if you have an English name

1065
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,080
then you are a real Christian otherwise you are not.

1066
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,480
You can't imagine how ignorant they are.

1067
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,960
And how the Christans are most fanatic. Looks funny but it is so.

1068
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,480
Because their fanatism is so beautifully managed.

1069
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,960
It is not like Khomeini is, which has start open fanaticism.

1070
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,960
You know, Khomeini is that and he has to accept he is.

1071
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,920
But this way it is very well polished, you know,

1072
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
beautifully done.

1073
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,120
Others can, may say they are troves

1074
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,600
but this is like a diamond artificially made.

1075
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,480
They do social work.

1076
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,640
This Christian way.

1077
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,720
Now for example if you ask somebody, a man in England,

1078
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,000
it's a Christian way to tell the way you see.

1079
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,960
What God has got to do with this, just tell Me?

1080
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,800
They have mixed up God with all these things.

1081
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,960
Such a big mixture they have made,

1082
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,760
that the fanaticism of Christianity is

1083
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,960
very much in delusion.

1084
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,480
For them, begging in the name of God is also Christian.

1085
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,000
It's a very dangerous game,

1086
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,880
because they are the cleverest of all, they think.

1087
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,480
So, the way they have entangled themselves into,

1088
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,600
it's so much dogmatic and so beautifully philosophised.

1089
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,520
It's a philosophy,

1090
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,080
to know if you have to get out of it.

1091
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,480
It is so beautiful, you can't imagine. It's so beautiful.

1092
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,840
And so believe they are the most,

1093
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,560
kindest people, compassion personified,

1094
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,840
great people, Christians.

1095
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,040
And the Christains believe it.

1096
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Christ never asked you to beg.

1097
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,760
He never asked you to collect money for the poor.

1098
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,520
Nothing of the kind. He is from [?],you see.

1099
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,760
He wanted you to get your realization.

1100
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,760
That's what He wanted.

1101
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
You have created the poor.

1102
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,640
And you better look after them. That's not God's job.

1103
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,600
Communists are maybe the greatest Christians there,

1104
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,600
the way they look after their poor.

1105
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,560
God's job is one, is to give you realization for the [living].

1106
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,480
To take you away from this ignorance and mire of life,

1107
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,080
into that beautiful, blissful,

1108
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,440
kingdom of God. That is the work of God.

1109
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,480
And not these things which you describe back.

1110
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,760
But it looks so idealistic, you know.

1111
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,560
The whole thing is such an idealism.

1112
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,600
That's right, very, very dangerous.

1113
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,960
And it's so well organized.

1114
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,040
So well organized, you know.

1115
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,120
So well organized.

1116
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,560
Even the hymn numbers, everything,

1117
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,920
done so well, every book done so well,

1118
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,080
stand up to say, sit down,

1119
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,560
so regimented, beautifully.

1120
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,760
No one can realize even that this is,

1121
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,880
we are going all to madness, you see.

1122
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,960
It's a very wonderful illusion.

1123
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,840
We are not supposed to look this side or that side.

1124
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,640
It's all right. In England I have Christians,

1125
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,040
many [of them] have been Christians you see.

1126
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,120
I have Christians, Jews, or like this [unclear].

1127
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,120
Indian Christians, I don't have to even one, except for

1128
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,880
of course, my family belongs to them

1129
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,040
because they have known My childhood, they know Me.

1130
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,480
But the rest of them, for them I am a healer.

1131
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,960
Oh, yes, believe Me.

1132
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,600
Hindus are My disciples, then Muslims are but not Christians.

1133
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,520
Not one, I knew this.

1134
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,960
and when I went to America,

1135
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,920
they pronounced "a Christian mystic has come".

1136
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,600
That gave Me good marks, you know.

1137
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,640
People came to see Me because of the Christian mystic,

1138
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,960
properly baptized. I must get my certificate also.

1139
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,960
So our attitude should be of simply pity towards them.

1140
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,640
Like Blake has said, "The priest cursed,

1141
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,400
cursed my [unclear] when he baptized me."

1142
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,920
Something like that, he said really.

1143
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,760
We should have really simple pity for all the people,

1144
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,760
who go to churches where there are all the graves.

1145
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,760
They sit on the graves, take all the spirits into themselves.

1146
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,880
God save them.

1147
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,040
I don't know.

1148
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,560
While Christians, everyone is just like that.

1149
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,600
But, among the Christians only I am sure,

1150
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,760
only Sahaja Yoga will come up, very well.

1151
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,960
That's the power of Christ. I hope so.

1152
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,600
I hope so.

1153
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,040
Mislead,

1154
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,600
and mislead people also,

1155
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,000
who are enjoying that misleading

1156
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,920
are most difficult I mean, don't you think so?

1157
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,960
How can you talk to them?

1158
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,960
Who can break it?

1159
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,560
When I go to India, I can speak,

1160
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,760
in a cenacle that means Catholic, sankar cenacle means Catholic,

1161
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,600
temple,

1162
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,760
and thousands of people come to take marriage there.

1163
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,040
And they respect Me as a saint.

1164
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,040
Do you think in any church whatsoever,

1165
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,040
I could be respected like that,

1166
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,600
except for one "Unity Church" we had,

1167
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,680
where all kinds of bhoots are respected.

1168
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,440
So I was also called to give a lecture.

1169
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,120
It was I think a, more of a

1170
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,120
I don't know, money-making proposition whatever it was.

1171
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,720
Whatever it was.

1172
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,640
But in India, that's the, that's the blessing

1173
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,920
of the Hindus that they are not organized.

1174
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,480
For them saint is a saint.

1175
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,920
Even the prime minister, even the I would say, the

1176
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,880
president of India will stand for a saint.

1177
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,920
They won't sit.

1178
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,840
This ideas are not here.

1179
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,760
They are too organized to get out of

1180
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,080
this organized way, to find out

1181
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,840
what is beyond. You see, we just avoid our spirituality.

1182
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,600
Is satisfied by going to Sunday church, finished.

1183
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,920
Or to give some money for the feed.

1184
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,560
That's all. That's not the way it is.

1185
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,840
It's much, much, much more.

1186
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,800
But be careful,

1187
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,680
Christ has said, "You'll be calling Me, Christ, Crist.

1188
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,600
I won't recognize you"

1189
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,840
That's what they are. I'm sorry for them, really sorry.

1190
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,600
Any other question?

1191
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,960
Can everybody within our [unclear] at the most

1192
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
[unclear]  rise enough?

1193
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,640
Yes, everybody can.

1194
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,720
But everybody doesn't mind, want it.

1195
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,960
You see, they don't want it. See how many people are here.

1196
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,080
But if it was some sort of a falsehood,

1197
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,560
if I come with two horns,

1198
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,960
there could have been three halls big like these.

1199
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,680
People don't want reality, my child, they don't want it.

1200
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,960
They never wanted it.

1201
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,600
You always crucified it.

1202
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,760
But now at least there are some who really want it.

1203
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,080
And I am happy you think of others also.

1204
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,960
Very happy to know that.

1205
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,840
It was a difficult task.

1206
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,960
I have to work very hard.

1207
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,560
They don't want reality because in Sahaja Yoga it is a becoming,

1208
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,840
It is not just to come and filling a form,

1209
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,440
"All right, you are the member", or you pay supposing a one pound,

1210
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,520
memebership. It's this o.k.? It's your becoming, what you become.

1211
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,080
It's your thing, that must happen. You must get your properties.

1212
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,600
This is the problem.

1213
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,640
You have to give up [independence].

1214
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,960
It's easy to give up.

1215
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,600
It's very easy but I never talk about it before realization.

1216
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,760
Because after realization you just give up things.

1217
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,520
If I tell you, half of you might go away

1218
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,880
so I'm not going to tell you.

1219
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,920
You better get your realization. It will work it out.

1220
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,760
It will establish a new priority within yourself, natural.

1221
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,880
Because if you have light you see.

1222
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,960
You see snake as snake and rope a rope.

1223
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,640
So I don't have to tell you, you just see, you just feel,

1224
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,920
it happens to you.

1225
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,760
Yes, I know, I know. I wish I could.

1226
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,640
It can be done.

1227
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,800
To all the new people, whatever race you may belong.

1228
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,960
It can. But how many are there?

1229
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,760
It's a very slow movement.

1230
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,960
For four years I had only seven Britains with Me.

1231
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,440
I was struggling with them. Four years, can you imagine? In England.

1232
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,560
Such tremendous task.

1233
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,120
All right, so you get your realization now.

1234
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,880
Let's see how many you bring in.

1235
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,880
Yeah?

1236
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,800
Divine Holy Mother,

1237
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:08,680
after Self-realization, how long in this most difficult times

1238
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,920
is it possible to stop reincarnating

1239
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,920
and seek perfection?

1240
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,720
Is it easy [unclear], what did he say?

1241
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,000
Is it easy to [unclear], what do you say?

1242
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,760
I was saying after realization is it possible

1243
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,760
to stop reincarnating

1244
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,760
and to be perfect in these trouble times?

1245
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,760
You are reincarnated by Self realization itself.

1246
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,480
And to stop having rebirth and birth?

1247
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,880
You don't think of these things afterwards.

1248
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,480
Because you are not futuristic anymore. You live in the present.

1249
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,720
You see these ideas of rebirth and

1250
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,560
this frightening staff we should not have rebirth.

1251
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,960
Why not?

1252
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,120
I mean, you create a beautiful house, everything,

1253
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,880
and then you say that you don't live in it?

1254
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,680
When you become a rich man you want to enjoy your wealth isn't it?

1255
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,760
But we are not Buddha's state

1256
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,760
birth is suffering, death is suffering.

1257
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,480
Yes, that's true, but not realization.

1258
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,040
You see, what he has said is,

1259
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,120
Buddha has asked you to

1260
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,040
limit your desires

1261
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,720
of ascent. Because people talk of God, once

1262
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,880
they talked of in India when somebody talked of the deities.

1263
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,120
That was a problem, because it became a talk again.

1264
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,840
Then they talked of God,

1265
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,080
God was so that abstract,

1266
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,920
like they said Yehova and other things,

1267
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,120
because they wanted people to,

1268
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,560
get over their

1269
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,120
stuck-up points you see. Nothing worked you see.

1270
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,480
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about

1271
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,560
the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God.

1272
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,480
Let's talk of that.

1273
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,600
Let people get to Self realization, then we'll talk about God.

1274
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,880
So He said, "All right. Only Self realization. No God, nothing."

1275
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,600
That was His job. Fix you up with the idea of Self-realization.

1276
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,680
He said, "No question [permitted],

1277
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,920
no worship, get your Self realization.

1278
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:36,080
They are worshipping everything under the sun

1279
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,960
these Buddhists.

1280
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,440
What am I to do?

1281
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,560
So whatever Buddha has said is, everything is re-said

1282
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,960
in Sahaja Yoga.

1283
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,880
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami"

1284
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,040
I surrender myself,

1285
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,760
to the enlightened One.

1286
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,720
The One which is enlightened is your spirit.

1287
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,920
"Sangham Sharanam Gachami"

1288
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,520
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

1289
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,000
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person,

1290
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,680
how can you surrender?

1291
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,560
Buddha or whatever He said, is not understood before realization.

1292
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,560
You cannot. "Dharmam Sharanam Gachami".

1293
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,040
Is the sustanance within us.

1294
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,840
Sharanam means you become that.

1295
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,440
It's not a mental thing, "Oh, I surrender myself".

1296
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,480
But you just become.

1297
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,760
You become the enlightened one.

1298
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,600
You become the collectively conscious, you become [....Dharma]

1299
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,760
the sustanance, the religion. You see, become.

1300
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,760
That's what He wanted.

1301
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,080
But for them "Sharanam Gachami" means take a wheel in the hand

1302
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,120
go on "Buddham Sharanam Gachami".

1303
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,120
What this wheel is going to do I just don't understand, you know.

1304
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,440
They'll go on hours together, they'll go mad.

1305
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,800
They will end up into lunatic asylum, beieve Me.

1306
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,000
Or like mad you have to say something, all the time praying.

1307
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,520
Is that the way you are becoming?

1308
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,960
They don't even know where is Buddha placed into yourself.

1309
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,960
But Sahaja Yogis know where He is placed and how to please Him.

1310
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,400
Whatever He said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

1311
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,440
absolutely hundred percent.

1312
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,120
Actually Buddha was nobody else

1313
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,520
but an Incarnation, who reincarnated Himself

1314
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,840
as Adi Shankaracharya. You can see, clearly in your being,

1315
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,000
and can be proved on Kundalini again.

1316
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,960
You see, how can I prove it?

1317
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,760
To understand them, first you get your realization.

1318
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,480
Again, I am talking like Buddha only.

1319
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,840
He tried something by which

1320
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,760
He thought people will take to realization.

1321
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,880
But human beings as they are...

1322
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,720
He thought they are very much involved in materialism,

1323
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,960
take them out, try this, try that. Nothing works out.

1324
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,880
Nothing.

1325
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,600
Only thing that works out, the real happening, nothing else.

1326
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,920
So you...

1327
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,480
What's it?

1328
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,680
Say it loudly.

1329
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,960
All right?

1330
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,840
Is there somebody else saying something which I didn't hear?

1331
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,880
See, the vibrations are so much that really we were in fact...

1332
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,400
You can't imagine.

1333
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,760
I don't know how I will sleep with what you are talking.

1334
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,560
It's really too much showing out.

1335
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,840
Unbelieving. Why?

1336
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,880
There must be some great seekers who must have come today.
