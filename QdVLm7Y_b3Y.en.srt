1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:06,846
The birthday of Your Mother, and
all such celebrations

2
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:10,625
have a very deep significance,

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:22,368
because on such occasions, special
vibrations flow in the atmosphere.

4
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:30,766
When all the celestial bodies,

5
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:37,019
the Eternal Personalities,

6
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:45,281
Gods and Goddesses sing the praise,

7
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:54,673
and that’s how the whole atmosphere
is filled with mirth and happiness.

8
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:04,920
Human beings also express their gratitude.

9
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:12,573
The expression of gratitude
and love

10
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,623
is done in different, different ways
in different countries,

11
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:28,294
but the substance remains the same
and the forms change.

12
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:40,265
The substance is like the ocean which flows

13
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,641
continuously towards the shores

14
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:53,787
and the ripples which touch the shores

15
00:01:53,988 --> 00:02:01,871
are again repelled back, and a nice
pattern is formed.

16
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:12,073
It is such a spontaneous thing
and is so beautiful,

17
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:16,225
creates such a beautiful pattern
in the atmosphere.

18
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:22,965
All these waves when they weave together
the pattern of love

19
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:28,617
they soothe human beings, they enchant
human beings

20
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,347
and the whole thing is very blissful.

21
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:43,059
On such occasions a special type
of feelings develop,

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,784
which we cannot express in words

23
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:56,650
so the expression could be in any form.

24
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:05,586
But the main thing is the expression.
God has expressed Himself by Creation,

25
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:09,259
by creating this Creation.

26
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,024
While the Creation has to express
its gratitude

27
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:20,786
by glorifying Him, and this play must
go on eternally.

28
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:25,109
It’s the most beautiful play.

29
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:33,313
Those who indulge into this play
lead an eternal life.

30
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:39,323
That life is unending, never breaks

31
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:45,639
and binds the whole universe with
its beautiful music.

32
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:58,359
Today, specially, I have to speak to people

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,582
who feel weak to follow Sahaja Yoga,

34
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:12,852
who are fickle minded, those who
lack strength,

35
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:22,502
those who are afraid of taking Sahaja
Yoga seriously.

36
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:33,178
It is very important that fickle mindedness
must be seen clearly – why we are fickle.

37
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:40,794
Mostly it might be the ego that
is stopping you

38
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:46,808
from doing something that is very,
very important.

39
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:54,772
The ficklemindedness comes to us by various
ways, as I said one of them is ego.

40
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:59,881
A fickle minded person can be frightened
by his own ego

41
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:08,072
and he may stop doing Sahaja Yoga
after going up to a point,

42
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:13,214
because the ego might say now,
“Here forward, if you go,

43
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:18,027
there is a tunnel in which you cannot
enter.

44
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:23,964
You should not go any further.
It’s very dangerous."

45
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:32,130
It could be marred by your Sloth. Sloth
is the curse of this country I feel.

46
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,895
It’s the curse of the Sahaja Yoga also.

47
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:39,538
I do not know if it is the curse
of the Western World

48
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:50,675
but Sloth is something, is like a devil
that can keep you very much glued

49
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:55,299
to your own positions and will
not allow you to move out.

50
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,382
For example in the morning you get up
and you think that, “Oh, it’s all right,

51
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,837
what’s the need to get up early
in the morning?

52
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,192
There is no need to do any meditation.

53
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:15,980
I’ll do it tomorrow”. Otherwise you start
thinking that,

54
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:18,898
“It can be done after a month,
doesn’t matter,

55
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,795
Mataji is here, everything will be
all right."

56
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:28,456
But you must know that there are so many
imperfections within you,

57
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:35,167
and if you do not meditate now, seriously,
take it up as a very serious thing,

58
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:40,094
you may lag behind so much that
you may be dropped out.

59
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:43,852
Meditation is very important
after Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:49,432
You have slept and slept all your life.
Sleeping is not so important.

61
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:53,247
You have to today promise Me that,
from tomorrow,

62
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:59,411
you all are going to get up in the morning
and meditate.

63
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,623
I was suggesting that if you take your
baths in the morning would be better,

64
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:08,197
so that you won’t have your sleepy
condition.

65
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:13,646
Sloth is such a devious thing that you do
not see it.

66
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:17,042
It explains everything. If you say,
“Oh I am sick”

67
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:21,471
it will say, “Oh you are so sick you should
go to the hospital”.

68
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:25,644
If you say, “I’m tired” it will say,
“You are extremely tired”.

69
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:31,439
Why should you be so tired? It is nothing
but your Sloth is telling you that,

70
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,505
“You are extremely tired, you better
not do meditation

71
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,905
now you are extremely tired. You better
take some rest, is important”.

72
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:44,043
Sloth is worse than superego and ego.

73
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:48,591
Is a kind of an inertia which pulls
you down,

74
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:53,722
and that inertia you have to really
throw away and get out of it.

75
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:59,869
Because it explains everything, you like
it, because it gives you little comfort,

76
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,012
and you want to rely on your Sloth.

77
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:08,839
But Krishna has said in Gita, that Sloth
is the worst thing

78
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,502
that can happen to human beings.
If they take to Sloth,

79
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:19,708
if they accept Sloth, they will have
all explanations for being Slothful.

80
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,637
He, “Alasya”, He calls it, is the worst
disease according to Him,

81
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:28,530
for any aspirant of spiritual life.

82
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:35,186
You may think that, “You see, I’m not
well now”

83
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:38,058
or anything, Sloth can give you
any ideas.

84
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,212
Because I don’t have that so I don’t know
what ideas it gives you

85
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:47,561
but it can give you any kind of idea
that would be very, very appealing to you

86
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:50,498
because it knows how to please
your ego.

87
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:57,227
Sloth is a ego-satisfying thing,
ego-pampering stuff,

88
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:00,578
and it makes you feel that, “Oh you are
very tired”. What are you tired about?

89
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,220
You are all young people, why should you
be tired?

90
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,817
You get tired so soon, is nothing but
your Mr. Sloth telling you you are tired.

91
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:15,984
You'll be surprised, after feeling tired
you'll run for two miles, you can run.

92
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:24,820
Now why Sloth works Sahaja Yoga
so adversely?

93
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:29,543
Why Sloth works out against Sahaja Yoga
so much?

94
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:36,805
The reason is, because we are not yet
identified with our wellbeing.

95
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,850
We do not think that “We have to be better,
we have to improve,

96
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:45,212
we have to go further, there’s a big gap,
we have to do it”.

97
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:50,945
We are not identified with our progress.
Supposing if I tell you, in England,

98
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:56,110
that if you run two miles every day in
the morning, you will get a beauty prize,

99
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:03,809
99.9% people, of women of this country,
would be running early in the morning.

100
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,930
Supposing if somebody tells men

101
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:14,112
that, “You will get Mr. Universe if you 
run every day five miles in the morning”,

102
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:20,533
there will be, I don’t know, 99.999%
people may be running like that,

103
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,740
because we are identified with that kind
of a competition

104
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,213
which is very materialistic, which is
of no value.

105
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:36,292
But when you give up even that competition
you fall into another competition

106
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:40,476
is everybody is competing each other
in Sloth.

107
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:44,116
They will get up in the morning,
see around,

108
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:47,607
“Now, Cooly’s still sleeping, all right,
let me sleep”.

109
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:51,181
So Cooly will think, “He’s still sleeping,
let me sleep”.

110
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:59,118
So there is a big competition on as to
who is going to wake up first,

111
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,825
who is going to do this.

112
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:07,259
And if somebody gets up then one starts
finding faults that, “He got up but what?

113
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,105
He was just taking tea” or “He was
talking”.

114
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:12,220
What about you? You were still in bed!

115
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,391
At least he got up, was talking, doesn’t
matter. But he was kicking.

116
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:21,107
What about you who was still slumbering
in the bed?

117
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:25,360
Now it’s such a childlike thing, I mean,
it’s such a childish thing to talk about

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,338
with such intellectuals as you are, such
well read and such well posted people.

119
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,292
That doesn’t behove Me, a Mother
of such great people, to talk like this,

120
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:40,951
but sometimes I find My Sahaja Yogis
are like two year old children,

121
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:46,054
and then I have to tell them that,
“Now you are grown up”.

122
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:50,005
You see, you can explain it

123
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:56,534
but how are you going to explain yourself?

124
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:04,894
Because if you have to grow, if you want
your tree to grow,

125
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:09,707
you must change your priorities
and your identifications.

126
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:16,664
If you have to be a first-class Sahaja
Yogi, you have to put your attention to it.

127
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:23,779
I do not know how to fix it up.
Supposing we fix it up like this,

128
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,145
it’s very childish but I have to tell you
because I have seen this is the problem,

129
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:35,069
that, “The day I don’t get up, I’ll have
to pay 10 pee”, let’s keep it like that.

130
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,975
If you are getting much more pay
then put it at ten pounds.

131
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,836
But something like that. Or you can
say that,

132
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:47,794
“That day I’ll give up one sweater
of mine”. Start it like that.

133
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:51,882
It’s very easy. People will say that,
“No Mother, when I meditate,

134
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,765
you know, something goes wrong with me” –
means you are wrong,

135
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:59,958
there’s something wrong with you.
So you better sit down and meditate.

136
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:07,497
Now, I must say, if you do not meditate,
you are very selfish.

137
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:13,034
That’s the main point is. Because
when you come here,

138
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,735
scorpions come out of you [Mother says “Me”
but obviously means “you”] to bite My feet.

139
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:23,712
There are snakes coming out of you to bite
My feet. Do you want to do that to Me?

140
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:26,398
Or else to others also.

141
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:30,672
The other day somebody came to My house and
Chaya and all these people were there.

142
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:35,386
He was so caught up that they were
reeling with giddiness,

143
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:40,699
and everybody was trying to take it out
and work it out.

144
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:49,140
If you want Sahaja Yoga to work out
in this country and in the West,

145
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:54,375
we have to understand our own value,
and we must work it out.

146
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:59,925
Every time if you are catching, every time
you meet Me you are catching,

147
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:03,678
then how are you going to feel
the Kundalini?

148
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,489
You must know how the Kundalini moves
within yourself.

149
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,082
Say, where it is, how far it has gone.

150
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:17,797
At least there should be at least
ten people like that, minimum,

151
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,991
because I have worked here so hard.

152
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:24,016
You don’t know, I didn’t work
so many years in India

153
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:28,500
and there will be at least 80% people
who can feel the Kundalini moving –

154
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,538
it is here, it is there, it is there.

155
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:36,017
And some people feel over-satisfied
with their progress also.

156
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:41,804
It is like a full group of people going
somewhere, say a tug-of-war.

157
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:48,500
Even one person moves two steps forward
than where he is, the whole thing moves.

158
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:53,754
But we do not see to the people who are
moving it towards them,

159
00:14:53,955 --> 00:15:01,138
what we always see is, “How can we compete
with the person who is not moving?

160
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:07,354
If he is moving back two steps, we can
move back three steps."

161
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:12,619
This kind of attitude will not help us.

162
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,707
You know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way,

163
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:23,782
is the only method that Divine Grace
has given you, by which

164
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:29,682
you are going to transform the whole
world, and lazy lumps:

165
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:36,789
how can they help Sahaja Yoga?
Laziness is the worst thing today.

166
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,239
I know today is not a day to say all these
things, but you all have to promise to Me

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,951
that you are going to give up your
laziness – Swaha.

168
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:53,215
That’s what I have seen that, whenever
I meet you people you are caught up.

169
00:15:53,667 --> 00:16:01,507
The another thing which goes against Sahaja
Yoga is, I have told you hundred times,

170
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:08,508
I don’t know how many times, is to talk ill
about other Sahaja Yogis.

171
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:13,933
We are all part and parcel of one body, say
we are all part and parcel of one hand.

172
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:21,125
Now if this finger starts talking ill about
this one, what is it going to do?

173
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:27,057
Talking ill about each other is a very
wrong thing.

174
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:33,877
So today also decide that, “We will never
talk ill about anybody else

175
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,060
but we’ll look at ourselves – what is
our position."

176
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,283
I’ve seen people passing remarks
about other people

177
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,847
who themselves are very badly caught up,

178
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:51,234
and not worried about themselves. Now,
by this, how are you going to improve?

179
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:55,423
If you do not pay attention to yourself, and
pay attention to others you cannot improve.

180
00:16:55,624 --> 00:17:02,643
So another promise should be that, “We will
not talk ill about other Sahaja Yogis."

181
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:08,062
But no Sahaja Yogi should take anything for
granted.

182
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:12,536
We have to really work very hard.

183
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:22,175
So second habit of talking ill about other
Sahaja Yogis should be Swaha,

184
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,175
and thinking even about it.

185
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,667
You are absolutely cutting the threads
of Sahaja Yoga,

186
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:32,612
which I have very sweetly woven.

187
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:36,868
Now you would be generous to Me, I know.
You can be very generous, you have given Me

188
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:40,940
a very beautiful painting, I am
very thankful to you.

189
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:45,696
But try to do it to others also –
generosity.

190
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:50,429
You should be really bound together and you
can see then what we can produce.

191
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:55,486
You have seen how nicely we did
the exhibition. Everybody was enamored.

192
00:17:55,687 --> 00:18:01,054
Everybody was very happy that you did
so well. It was such a joyous thing

193
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:04,494
and everybody was congratulating,
they telephoned to Me.

194
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:07,163
They said, “How they are together?

195
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:11,096
There was no quarrel, no fighting, nothing.
They did it so well."

196
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:16,189
So tell your mind that, “How dare you
think against any Sahaja Yogi”.

197
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,891
Do you know all of you are saints
of the highest calibre?

198
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:28,147
And this kind of wretched, nonsensical
thing, so low level, how can you do?

199
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,915
I may talk ill about others,

200
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,979
I may say that, “He’s bad”, just
to test you.

201
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,276
So many times I do that to see how
you feel about someone.

202
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:47,369
If I say somebody’s bad, just keep quiet.

203
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,292
It will have two purposes. One will
be that,

204
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:56,408
if you are sympathising with someone,
so I am saying, “Don’t sympathize”

205
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,208
because you are sympathizing with
a wrong person.

206
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,948
Or maybe I am just testing you.

207
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:06,492
So keep it noted in your mind, if I say
that person is no good,

208
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:11,370
then keep it in your mind, “Am I
sympathizing with that person?”

209
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:15,834
This negative sympathy is very common.

210
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:22,539
So third promise should be that we will
not sympathize.

211
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,259
If you sympathize, ‘sym-pathize’ means
‘you share the pathos of others’.

212
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,132
You have to just share the joy of another
person.

213
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:36,693
So we will not sympathize with others,
with anyone,

214
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:42,696
but we will share the joy of another
person.

215
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,036
The part that is joy of another person,
we are going to share

216
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:49,925
and look out for the joy. Try to see
the good points.

217
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:53,701
Some people just cannot see.

218
00:19:55,375 --> 00:20:01,199
That’s how you dominate each other.
That’s a wrong thing.

219
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,003
In a growth of vital importance it is
important to know,

220
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:12,804
what are the vital parts. If you try
to press one vital part,

221
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:19,450
you cannot grow also, because you are
all supported together.

222
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:22,750
So the third thing is – you have to promise

223
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:33,877
that you are not anymore going
to sympathize with anybody else.

224
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:39,970
None of you can love as much as I can love.

225
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:48,073
And then one should know that if you have
sympathies, there is no need at all.

226
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:52,771
But you should have feelings for everyone.

227
00:20:54,995 --> 00:21:00,896
Now every human being has a character
and a temperament.

228
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:06,728
Apart from his Self, is his Spirit which 
is pure, in its own form,

229
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:10,216
it just gives you vibrations, tells you
right, left and all that.

230
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,017
But everybody has a character,
is important,

231
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:18,463
because the light that is burning
in a candle can be different style,

232
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:23,367
another different style. Looks nice,
variety looks nice, it gives you beauty.

233
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:26,130
So your character you must know.

234
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:31,568
Respect your character and enjoy
the character of another person.

235
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,769
I really enjoy your characters

236
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,103
and how sweetly you behave towards
your own characters.

237
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:40,736
But temperament is not your Self.

238
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:45,137
Temperaments you must give up.
Temperaments are horrid things.

239
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:50,576
You give up your temperaments but keep
to your character.

240
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:55,696
A character is something so great,
is something so sweet,

241
00:21:55,897 --> 00:22:01,309
and I see that character in a person,
and I feel like –

242
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,497
how is it they are not identifying with
their character but with temperament?

243
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:10,839
For supposing somebody has a temperament of
saying something silly – is a temperament.

244
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,833
So you just say, “What is this going on?

245
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:17,001
Why am I saying things silly?
I better get rid of it”.

246
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,969
Somebody has a temperament of getting
boiled up very fast –

247
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,559
so you see to it that this temperament
is not your character.

248
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,003
But some people are so low level that even
in their character you can find

249
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:35,346
something going on and on and on,
which is – their temperament has become

250
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:38,592
one with their character.
So try to separate.

251
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:43,801
First of all you separate yourself from
your temperament to your character,

252
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:49,652
and in that character you enlighten
your light.

253
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:54,856
See how beautiful you will be, you’ll enjoy
each other much more.

254
00:22:55,057 --> 00:23:00,375
Now when you are with Me, I know everything
about you, no doubt.

255
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:05,078
Everything. In your mind, what’s going,
I read minds.

256
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,524
I read everything, but what I see
is your light.

257
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:16,839
Then what I see is your character. I do
not bother about your temperament,

258
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,435
but a time comes when this temperament
becomes more dominant thing.

259
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:23,676
You become so much identified with
[dominant], “I am like that!

260
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:27,208
I am like that! What to do? I am like that!
It happens to me.

261
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:32,805
I…I…I…I…I." So the fourth resolution
should be – No more “I”.

262
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:39,093
We are not going to talk about “I”,
“I think”, “I believe”. Who are you?

263
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:44,748
“I believe” – now who are you?
Are you Jesus Christ,

264
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:50,206
that your beliefs and your faiths
are that great?

265
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:56,326
So we should say, “We believe”,
“We are like that”.

266
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,754
Now we have to move in one body,

267
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,129
with all our different characters we have
to say “We”,

268
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,592
“We which are part and parcel
of one personality."

269
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:11,981
So always say “We”, and this is
how we must know

270
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:17,287
that these temperaments are the things
which keeps us out from everyone.

271
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:21,447
Temperaments can be – somebody is
a crying baby.

272
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:23,843
Then that person will remain a crying baby

273
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:27,604
for such a long time till I’ll break
My head.

274
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:30,864
If somebody is a frightened person,
he’ll be always frightened like that.

275
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:35,085
You say anything – frightened.
It’s useless.

276
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:37,965
Why to be like that? You be normal.

277
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:43,766
If you have that kind of a temperament
you be normal. Is not good.

278
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:47,150
Some person is an aggressive person,
or a hot tempered person.

279
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:50,573
He’ll be losing temper all the time.
That’s a temperament again,

280
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:54,928
that’s not his character. Character shows
in small, small things.

281
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:58,640
I’ll show you a character.

282
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:05,161
Now a person has a character that
he’s very generous.

283
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,626
He will say something which will be
very generous.

284
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:15,222
A person who is a loving character,

285
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:19,319
he will do something which will show
that he’s extremely loving.

286
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,721
So you first find out what is your
character.

287
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:26,004
Supposing you are a loving person,
then why not love each other?

288
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:29,806
Why not talk of love? Why not be kind?

289
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:33,629
We suppress that, and we take
our temperament as our own.

290
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,928
And once you take your temperament
as your own,

291
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:40,534
there are problems and problems and
problems. They are just like bubbles.

292
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:45,794
These temperaments have no value,
no substance, useless.

293
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:49,017
And they are the greatest joy killers.

294
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:53,524
If you have one person who is
temperamental – [you’ve] had it.

295
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:58,530
All of you will know that this person has
this temperament – they’ll run away.

296
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:02,414
People have their own ways of doing things,

297
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:08,135
that one has to merge, has to surrender
to The Whole.

298
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:13,348
We must learn to surrender our own
little, little things to The Whole,

299
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:17,682
and then you’ll be surprised that we
will become

300
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:22,187
so congenial, so integrated – despite
our different characters.

301
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:25,897
You have to maintain your different
character, different style of talking,

302
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:29,473
different style of walking, different style
of expression.

303
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:33,926
But the character, if it is not brought
forward,

304
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,568
the whole thing is so ugly so horrid.

305
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:46,283
Like the stinking, rotting leaves
these days.

306
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:53,537
But if you remove the leaves, these
old leaves, these useless leaves,

307
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:57,781
then you find the beautiful grass below.

308
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:02,201
So nobody should identify with your
temperament.

309
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:06,226
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:09,638
You must know that people are going
to come to Sahaja Yoga

311
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:13,926
because of you not because of Me.

312
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,608
They cannot understand Me.
I am beyond them.

313
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,798
I say something of the seventh floor.
They just don’t understand.

314
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,650
They will understand you, not Me.

315
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,418
This is very important, perhaps you people
do not realize.

316
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,905
You are not, supposing, taking Sahaja Yoga
seriously,

317
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:36,726
you are not doing anything about it.
You are still very much attached to things.

318
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,575
You are not willing to do this, you are
not willing to do that,

319
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:41,693
you don’t want to give up this or that.

320
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:46,610
Then people will say, “Oh he’s a Sahaj
Yogi, such a person. How can he be?

321
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,233
What has he achieved?” You may say,
“I’ve got the Bliss,

322
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,348
Mother has given me the Bliss”, they’ll
say, “Not, we cant see that in your face”.

323
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,200
You are still criticizing each other.
Still you think no end of yourself,

324
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,300
still you are catching here and there.

325
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:07,515
So it is you, you are the reflection
of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

326
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:11,120
They will know, they will see, “All right,
She is all right”.

327
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,270
I have seen people who are My relations,
they will say, “Oh You are Beyond.

328
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:17,222
Nobody can reach You and so we are
not going to try."

329
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,911
But if they see there are some people
have reached somewhere,

330
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,783
then they will come. Isn’t it?
So you are like people,

331
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:28,086
say I’m placed on the seventh floor and you
are placed on the first floor, all of you.

332
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,880
Then you come to the third floor then
people start seeing.

333
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,560
The first floor people cannot see
the seventh floor,

334
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:36,340
but if you are there at least
on the third floor they say,

335
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,207
“Oh there are some people on the third
floor, let’s go ahead!”

336
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:46,741
It is like that, because people see

337
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:52,678
what they can see, they cannot see
what they cannot see.

338
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:58,332
So when they see transformation in you,
they see that beauty in you,

339
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:02,423
then they know that there is Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:07,557
So for Sahaja Yoga’s sake we have
to sacrifice certain things

341
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:10,874
and I have told you already that we have
to sacrifice

342
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:15,968
all the funny habits or temperaments
we have got,

343
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,634
that today you have to decide that,
“I’ll give up this”,

344
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:24,623
and it is, today, as I told you, there are
special blessings, it will work out.

345
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:27,773
You have to become really good
Sahaja Yogis.

346
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,834
Now by comparing with each other
you cannot.

347
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:36,281
By talking to each other you cannot.
It is your own,

348
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:40,112
it is you who has to certify
“Am I all right?

349
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,599
Am I a good Sahaja Yogi? Am I really
progressing?”.

350
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,216
You must progress, if you do not progress
then you are not growing.

351
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:50,927
All of you have to grow, and grow and grow.

352
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,083
So the last of all is the day when
we are very happy.

353
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:02,853
Now this is the first time My birthday
is celebrated in London,

354
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:10,913
first time abroad, and all the Indian
Sahaja Yogis must be pining for Me.

355
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:15,366
I am sure, all over, they must be terribly
pining for Me,

356
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:18,629
so we have to think about them also.

357
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,077
Think about other Sahaja Yogis, what they
must be doing.

358
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,916
Think about them – you will feel happy.
You sit down and think about others

359
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:32,539
and you’ll feel very happy thinking
about those people

360
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,856
because they also are your brothers
and sisters.

361
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:41,021
And so nice it is to feel that you have
so many brothers and sisters

362
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:45,775
who speak the same language.
So we have to transcend

363
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:50,594
that limitation that we are in England –
no, we are everywhere,

364
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:55,663
and you can in your meditation, think
of all these people who are there.

365
00:30:55,864 --> 00:31:00,966
Establish your relationships with them.
Establish your understanding with them.

366
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,128
You write to them. As we have got
pen-friends,

367
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,018
you can get some pen-friendship and
you can start writing to people.

368
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:12,821
It will be a very good idea if you start
something like that.

369
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:18,807
But letter writing is another thing
which is Sloth, completely.

370
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:22,242
You see I write much...
(Interruption in the audio)

371
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:26,224
(...) who has limited money, he
sits down makes a budget.

372
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:29,883
In the same way you make the budget
of your timing.

373
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:33,914
You are always busy – doing what?

374
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:38,033
So let us find out that time, that time

375
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:44,325
when you have to allow yourself to grow,
that time which is required

376
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:50,527
for your personal attention, which is
required for your evolution,

377
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:55,813
that you must give. That is the due
you have to pay

378
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:01,602
because you are realized souls now
and the responsibility is your own.

379
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:05,915
In this, best thing is to take to wisdom.

380
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:09,503
Sit down once and take to wisdom
and think it over,

381
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:12,022
“Mataji has given us realization,
all right.

382
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:15,557
The germination has started, all right.
Where are we?

383
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:19,281
How far are we? Have we got even
our roots or not?

384
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:24,094
Have you got the shoots coming out or not?
Where are we?”

385
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,368
Just find out for yourself.

386
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,046
I know that Mataji is pulling all of you

387
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,411
and you are all dragged into it. You have
to be jolly well going, moving somewhere,

388
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:37,477
but if you give your motivating force,
all of you.

389
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:40,742
Not even one person should drag behind,
because his weight

390
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:46,862
is going to pull us back isn’t it?
So that’s why I say it is selfish.

391
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:50,947
If anybody lags behind, that weight we have
to pull again.

392
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:55,266
So what happens, it’s like the story that
a person who walks

393
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:59,615
three steps forward and five steps
backwards. When will he reach?

394
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:03,070
He’ll never reach. When will he reach?

395
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:06,980
Such a question, you see it is, as they 
asked in the mathematics, you see,

396
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:12,074
“When will he reach?” Such people who
move backwards faster than the forwards.

397
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:17,833
So everybody must decide that, “I am moving
backwards, I must move forwards."

398
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:24,931
By that you are helping the whole grow, and
will be the ideal thing for Sahaja Yoga.

399
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:27,315
So your individual growth should be
all right,

400
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:31,289
and your collective growth should
be all right. It takes not much.

401
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:35,275
Meditation you have to do. You have
to sit in Nirvichara.

402
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,520
You have to give up your thinking. Try
to be in Nirvichar, try to be in Nirvichar,

403
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:43,655
and you will be surprised how the thing
will flower out.

404
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:49,295
Next year I want to see many more people
to come.

405
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:53,379
Apart from that I also want to see
everybody progressing.

406
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,168
You see even if you get thousands of people
and of no quality what’s the use?

407
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,687
What are we going to do with them?

408
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:05,172
We have to have people of quality, people
who will work it out, who will get to it.

409
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:12,402
Who are identified but are not working
it out is useless.

410
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:18,914
So everyone must work it out, must
work hard.

411
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,960
Do not criticize others, do not sympathize,

412
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:26,370
and go further and further with
your progress.

413
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,477
The other day I was finding out the meaning
of the word ‘Ashram’,

414
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:34,067
means ‘a place for the ascetics to live’.

415
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:42,370
Ashram is a place, if you have to go there,
don’t carry all your luggage there.

416
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,532
You have to take very few things there.

417
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:47,944
You should be able to live with two, three
clothes in an ashram.

418
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:53,033
You see, Ashram is a place where you are
trained to be temperate,

419
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:58,935
where you are trained how to control your
senses, how to control your attention.

420
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:02,189
But there also what do we do?

421
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,306
Let us find out, what do we do to control
our attention?

422
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:09,121
Best thing is that when you go
to the ashram –

423
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:14,868
take to the rigorous treatment of yourself,
absolutely rigorous treatment,

424
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,950
“All right now we are in ashram,
let’s go all ahead”.

425
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,848
Early in the morning you get up,
you do this, you do that,

426
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,870
and you work it out in such a manner

427
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:25,764
that you see to it that once you get out
of the ashram,

428
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:29,172
you are absolutely perfected.
That should be the ashram.

429
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:34,894
While it seems that in the ashram, if you
go, people get worse. Is most surprising.

430
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:39,285
And even they told My husband.

431
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:42,052
He said, “What, what sort of an ashram 
you have

432
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:46,316
that people go and catch in the ashram?
What sort of an ashram it is?”.

433
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:52,015
The reason is, who are in the ashram
must maintain a certain discipline,

434
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:56,433
and get up in the morning and not indulge
in too much tea taking.

435
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,499
Everything must have a balance,
go on reducing.

436
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,510
Everything you can go on reducing.

437
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,169
See, if you can go on reducing your sugar
it will be nice.

438
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,118
I tell you how to give up tea, very easy.

439
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,419
You first of all stop taking sugar –
half of you will leave taking.

440
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,204
Then you stop taking any milk in it –
then the other half will give up,

441
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:23,125
and then you stop your tea. That’s how
it will work out.

442
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:27,610
But one need not go to that extreme
that you just don’t have any tea.

443
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:32,192
But also the other extreme is that, without
tea you cannot talk to each other,

444
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,534
every time there should be a tea.

445
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:38,120
Now, just now you have had no tea, nothing,
you have been sitting nicely.

446
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,981
Since morning you have got up, you are
looking very fresh and nice,

447
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:45,350
nobody is tired. But then, “I’m tired,
I must have tea”.

448
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,131
All these things all work together.

449
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:55,710
So one has to take a very, very pragmatic
attitude towards Sahaja Yoga,

450
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:59,477
and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.

451
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:03,529
Next year I will be 58 years of age.

452
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,366
I don’t know if I’ll be in London
or wherever it is,

453
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:10,030
or we may celebrate it in India.
All of us may go to India,

454
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:14,704
but it won’t look nice if the Sahaja Yogis
from here come down with Me

455
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:18,828
and there all the Sahaja Yogis there will
be shocked and look at you

456
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:23,158
and say, “What is this? Why are you
like this? We can’t understand”,

457
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,212
it won’t be nice. Now for next time
we are not going to do that.

458
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:31,225
For next time we are going to go over
there, much cleaner, much better.

459
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:35,590
Why not compete in this? Instead of Sloth,
why not compete?

460
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,737
If he’s getting at four o’clock, why
not I get at least quarter to four?

461
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:42,550
If, at least, five minutes to four.

462
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:46,415
Let us try to compete in these things
and it will work out.

463
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:49,760
If you want to do it, it is very easy
to do.

464
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:54,787
But going to India and everybody saying
that, “London Sahaja Yogis, Oh God!

465
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:57,968
What a headache, they are coming now,
we’ll have to clear them,

466
00:37:58,169 --> 00:37:59,990
this thing, that thing, all sorts
of things”.

467
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:03,159
They have had very funny experiences
so far.

468
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,531
For next time I would request you all

469
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:10,144
to prepare yourself assiduously
for one year.

470
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:12,630
Only try for one year, not more than that.

471
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,909
If you have to study, say, medicine,
you have to study for seven years.

472
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,662
Anything you have to do you have to study
for years together, you have done it now!

473
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:25,434
So one year religiously you see to it
that you live in joy, happiness

474
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:31,275
and friendship with others, and with
yourself in complete

475
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:37,310
assiduity and rigorous imprisonment.
Then only it is going to work out.

476
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:42,663
With others lot of love, lot
of friendship, sweetness.

477
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:48,643
With yourself complete rigorous
imprisonment. If you have a temper,

478
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:51,680
stand before the mirror and look
at yourself when you get angry –

479
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:56,982
you’ll get rid of it, you see. Then,
all sorts of things can be cured.

480
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:59,755
If you have any problem you ask Me,
I’ll tell you how to do it,

481
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:03,518
how to puncture your ego, everything
I can tell you individually.

482
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,619
But you come out with these problems,
you say, “Mother, this is my problem,

483
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,244
this is my problem. I don’t know,
I’m doing this, how to solve it?”

484
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:13,630
and it will work out. But by condemning
yourself

485
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:16,252
you are not going to work it out also.
This is another fashion is,

486
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:20,086
“I’m so bad, I’m no good”, is a fashion.

487
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,478
You are perfectly all right, nothing wrong
with you.

488
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,694
Only thing you have to work it out
and you have to come up.

489
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:31,971
So from one year that is finishing
to the next year.

490
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:38,324
We have to promise, we have to promise
on the day of Mataji’s birthday.

491
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:44,419
You have given Me such nice, beautiful
things. I love them, such nice sayings.

492
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:54,468
But I have to tell you that this time I am
giving you the discipline of Sahaja Yoga.

493
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:59,876
Discipline yourself. Discipline is very
important.

494
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:03,178
If you do not discipline yourself, any tree
which is not disciplined

495
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:07,178
cannot grow properly. You have 
to discipline yourself.

496
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,795
If you do not want to discipline, only
thing you’ll be coming to My program

497
00:40:10,996 --> 00:40:15,122
and will be of no use to Me. You have
to develop your depth,

498
00:40:15,323 --> 00:40:20,200
you have to go deeper into it and it has
to be worked out.

499
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,342
This year we are going to have lots
of other programs

500
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:31,440
which I have already talked to other
people. You can find out from them.

501
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,647
We are going to Paris, we are going
to Switzerland.

502
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:40,001
We are going to America and you’ll have
lots of time.

503
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:46,513
But even when you have no work, when
you are alone, you can work it out.

504
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:51,199
Every moment you have to work it out.
This year you really dedicate,

505
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,824
the year of dedication, for improving
yourself fully,

506
00:40:56,025 --> 00:41:03,670
working it out, meeting regularly
and doing it. Not only writing.

507
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,696
For example in the committee meeting,
everybody’s there.

508
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:10,070
Now you all discuss, write it down
in the paper, all right.

509
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:14,339
“We have to do this, we have to do that,
we’ll all get up at four o’clock”

510
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:21,091
and till six o’clock everybody’s snoring,
that sort of a thing is not going to help.

511
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:28,287
So we have to work it out because this is
what is in store for us.

512
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:34,155
It’s such a beautiful thing.
A little effort and what a joy,

513
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:40,539
little effort and what a personality!
Little effort and what a power!

514
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:48,120
Little effort and what a collective
strength!

515
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:54,428
So a little effort, “Have I put in little
more than what I can put in?”

516
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:58,436
And give up this idea of “I’m tired”.
Nobody’s going to get a heart attack,

517
00:41:58,637 --> 00:42:00,982
take it from Me.

518
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,529
Nobody’s heart is going to fail,
take it from Me.

519
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:12,151
You have lots of energy, but put it
in the right channel.

520
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:15,808
That is going to help all of us.

521
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:20,472
Also I would like to have from you
suggestions.

522
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:24,428
You sit down, talk to each other
for arranging other programs.

523
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:28,454
I am going to Brighton also, we have fixed
those dates also for Brighton.

524
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:33,149
But other places, wherever you want Me
to go. Say Edinburgh or any place.

525
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,716
I’m here May, June, July, like that
I’m here.

526
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:39,656
We’ll fix it up, whenever you say
we will do it.

527
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:43,382
But week days I can go, weekends is rather
difficult.

528
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,330
We have already fixed Paris and this thing
for weekends.

529
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,768
But weekends are difficult for Me because
I have another things to attend to.

530
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:55,252
So now I am with you do whatever
you please.

531
00:42:55,453 --> 00:43:00,257
But first and foremost thing is that
you have to be absolutely all right.

532
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:04,349
You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have
to know, you have to be experts.

533
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,172
I have seen people who come only yesterday
became great experts

534
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:12,566
while [those] who are slogging for seven 
years are still [slogging].

535
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:17,556
So we all have to work it that way and must
have faith in ourselves

536
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:23,777
as I have faith in you. I have great faith
in you and I can see

537
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:27,420
the beautiful time that we are going
to have together

538
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:33,744
and really enjoy ourselves thoroughly.
Absolutely we are going to enjoy.

539
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:38,784
You don’t have any frights, don’t take any

540
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:44,073
steps which can spoil other people’s
temperaments.

541
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:49,269
Either you are aggressive or
non-aggressive. But it is never so.

542
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,417
If you are aggressive then you give up
aggression then you become a timid person.

543
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:56,517
Timidness has no value in Sahaja Yoga.

544
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:03,792
What is it am I going to do with timid
people – timid, tired, fagged out?

545
00:44:03,993 --> 00:44:07,574
If you are tired, take some tonic,
get well.

546
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:12,116
All of you should get well, and see
that you really achieve

547
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:16,742
that sparkling radiance within.

548
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:21,478
You won’t believe that your Mother works
very hard.

549
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,674
Very, very hard She has to work
with you people,

550
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:28,972
and I have to really pull you through,
really pull you through.

551
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:32,970
But still you find Me very happy

552
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:41,696
because I see something that is so
beautiful, that is so nice,

553
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:47,577
so sweet, so great in you, and whenever
I see that

554
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:52,652
I just say, “This will all go away after
all, you see these are all dried leaves,

555
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:56,645
they will have to go, autumn will
be over and spring will be coming."

556
00:44:56,846 --> 00:45:00,642
So you see, I forget it, and I just don’t
worry about

557
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:03,247
how much I have worked, how much
I have to work out.

558
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:07,851
But trust each other, love each other
and give more trust

559
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:14,472
and more love and understanding
and no sympathy of any kind.

560
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,890
So I don’t know how to thank you again
and again

561
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:21,202
for making that function so successful.

562
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:24,714
People are very happy about it and we are
going, we are looking forward

563
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:27,398
to tomorrow’s program on the 24th

564
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,389
and that is going to be really a very,
very heavy day for all of us.

565
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,408
So after today’s this thing, you will know
that you are much better now.

566
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,771
Keep it up. Put yourself into bandhan.

567
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:45,921
Girdle up yourself, and “Onward Christian
soldiers”.

568
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:50,059
This is what it is, we have to be
in that way.

569
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,118
We are the people who are loving.
We love.

570
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,300
We distribute love. We emit love,

571
00:45:57,501 --> 00:46:01,973
and we have to be that picture and that
image that when people see they’ll say,

572
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:06,445
“Oh these are the right type of people”.
We need not wear any dresses

573
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:10,782
or anything like that, but only seeing you
people blooming like that

574
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:13,296
people have to believe that you are
all great.

575
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:18,979
You have already shown your great work in
that exhibition and people were enamored

576
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,139
how you are so transformed and you are
so great.

577
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,700
I mean, they were really enamored how
you did the whole job

578
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:28,255
so well and so systematically.

579
00:46:28,456 --> 00:46:34,452
So again I have to remind, on this day that
we have to promise our Mother

580
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:42,405
that, “Mother, this year we really promise
you we’ll work very hard.

581
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:46,351
We’ll be very compassionate,
[full of] kindness."

582
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:50,561
That’s not your right, that’s not the way
to do it, you see you should not laugh,

583
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:55,324
that’s not good manners. Just try to see,
what is the person saying.

584
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:58,392
Even if he’s stupid, no use laughing
at him.

585
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:03,063
Just see what he’s saying,
what is his attitude,

586
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:07,351
and all this will bring forth a very,
very beautiful image

587
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:10,572
of all My children, whom I love very much.

588
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:16,140
I will love and love and love. Whatever
may happen I’ll be your own.

589
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:21,457
But still, in My love I request you that
I cannot feel happy

590
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:25,842
unless and until I make you like Myself.
All right?

591
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,015
Thank you very much.
