00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:25,515
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

2
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:26,746
Thredbo, Australia

3
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:38,403
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

4
00:00:42,756 --> 00:01:04,486
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

5
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:06,366
time.

6
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:22,496
It was important to do it at the right time.

7
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:34,895
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

8
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:49,916
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

9
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:57,985
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

10
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:04,476
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

11
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:20,016
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

12
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:24,756
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

13
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:34,306
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

14
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:52,155
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

15
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:59,355
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

16
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:04,265
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

17
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:11,485
have not tasted the mango.

18
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:17,586
So what has happened now, was the question.

19
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:22,765
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

20
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,156
he took a samadhi.

21
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:34,836
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

22
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:40,536
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

23
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:51,946
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

24
00:03:51,946 --> 00:04:05,027
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

25
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:09,866
In a way they finished their life very early.

26
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:21,426
This was the question.

27
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:56,276
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

28
00:04:56,276 --> 00:05:13,026
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

29
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:27,326
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

30
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:39,005
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

31
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:48,366
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

32
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:55,846
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

33
00:05:55,846 --> 00:06:00,616
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

34
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:06,266
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

35
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:14,016
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

36
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:17,266
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

37
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:29,276
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

38
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:37,766
But you did not get dissolved.

39
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:50,185
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

40
00:06:50,185 --> 00:07:06,806
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

41
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:28,815
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

42
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:39,856
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

43
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:45,556
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

44
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:50,935
the Adi Shakti.

45
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:54,636
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

46
00:07:54,636 --> 00:08:04,556
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

47
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:08,465
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

48
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:17,656
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

49
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:21,095
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

50
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:28,266
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

51
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,586
who are just part and parcel of it.

52
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:42,676
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

53
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:46,916
who is Mahamaya.

54
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:57,016
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

55
00:08:57,016 --> 00:09:05,156
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

56
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:12,896
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

57
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:24,636
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

58
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,586
of the people who were carrying them.

59
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:33,706
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

60
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:42,756
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

61
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,615
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

62
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:56,276
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

63
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:57,606
yogi.

64
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:03,816
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

65
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,036
have to observe.

66
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:08,735
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

67
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:20,855
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

68
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:32,006
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

69
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:36,586
Some people are extremely troublesome.

70
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:46,466
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

71
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:59,276
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

72
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,276
are troublesome.

73
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:07,786
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

74
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:10,656
simple thing but is very important.

75
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:21,636
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

76
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:24,536
case is a bad Hamsa.

77
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:38,396
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

78
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:47,706
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

79
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,746
Actually you must obey Me.

80
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:59,906
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

81
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:16,786
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

82
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:31,006
and they are acting as cells in My body?

83
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:39,846
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

84
00:12:39,846 --> 00:13:00,386
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

85
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:17,086
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

86
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:26,975
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

87
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:36,216
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

88
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:41,175
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

89
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:49,035
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

90
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:59,086
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

91
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:02,785
ultimately when you get your realization.

92
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:11,816
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

93
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:20,066
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

94
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,475
clearcut.

95
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:29,756
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

96
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:39,305
a ordained thing.

97
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:43,146
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

98
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:51,175
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

99
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:56,636
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

100
00:14:56,636 --> 00:15:03,376
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

101
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:10,425
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

102
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:16,946
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

103
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:23,055
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

104
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:27,876
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

105
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:33,526
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

106
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:42,045
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

107
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:48,576
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

108
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:57,316
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

109
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:09,545
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

110
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:14,105
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

111
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:22,026
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

112
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:34,186
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

113
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:44,636
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

114
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:55,386
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

115
00:16:55,386 --> 00:17:01,716
anyone who wants to do it.

116
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:10,726
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

117
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:23,485
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

118
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:28,196
can reside in My heart forever.

119
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:34,486
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

120
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:39,906
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

121
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:49,766
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

122
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:57,836
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

123
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:01,166
people, we are very frightened.

124
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:10,476
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

125
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:20,446
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

126
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,886
shifting, so I had gone out.

127
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:31,315
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

128
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,315
to some lady.

129
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:40,166
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

130
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,075
was a chain on.

131
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:49,796
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

132
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:55,955
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

133
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,426
I was surprised.

134
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:03,726
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

135
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,976
other – horrible!

136
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:13,006
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

137
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:16,186
done with the child, who had come to her door?

138
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:19,936
What was there to be so frightened of?

139
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:27,335
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

140
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:35,016
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

141
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:39,996
that others may do the same thing to you.

142
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:44,256
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

143
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:49,406
your house?

144
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:57,126
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

145
00:19:57,126 --> 00:20:00,866
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

146
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,096
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

147
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:07,536
What has happened?

148
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:11,796
Just like a dead body moving about.

149
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:21,925
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

150
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:28,466
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

151
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:35,506
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

152
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:44,416
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

153
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,596
people.

154
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:49,976
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

155
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:53,656
I can’t bear it within Myself.

156
00:20:53,656 --> 00:21:02,565
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

157
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:03,565
happens?

158
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:07,195
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

159
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:20,506
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

160
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:28,336
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

161
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:32,706
cell which is creating a cancer.

162
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:37,106
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

163
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:47,246
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

164
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:51,716
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

165
00:21:51,716 --> 00:22:00,966
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

166
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:10,126
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

167
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:15,686
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

168
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,506
So then reaction starts.

169
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:21,806
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

170
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:27,236
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

171
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:35,346
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

172
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:41,525
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

173
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:42,955
– it’s finished.

174
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:45,096
Open your hearts.

175
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:51,756
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

176
00:22:51,756 --> 00:23:02,195
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

177
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,526
who has dominated them.

178
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:11,646
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

179
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:12,796
to them.

180
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:20,436
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

181
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:31,776
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

182
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:40,336
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

183
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:46,606
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

184
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:55,476
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

185
00:23:55,476 --> 00:24:04,006
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

186
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:08,416
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

187
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:12,196
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

188
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:20,455
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

189
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:24,226
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

190
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:32,825
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

191
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:41,575
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

192
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:43,486
I help Myself?

193
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:56,976
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

194
00:24:56,976 --> 00:25:00,736
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

195
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:10,006
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

196
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:13,026
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

197
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:17,746
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

198
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:33,726
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:47,236
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

200
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:54,096
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

201
00:25:54,096 --> 00:26:02,636
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

202
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:07,906
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

203
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:12,606
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

204
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,046
they are talking about.

205
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:16,217
Same with the French.

206
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:26,466
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

207
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:34,266
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

208
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:45,536
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

209
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:55,606
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

210
00:26:55,606 --> 00:27:01,697
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

211
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:09,786
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

212
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:20,656
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

213
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:36,286
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

214
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:43,085
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

215
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:46,976
say, and we feel they are fighting.

216
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:55,825
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

217
00:27:55,825 --> 00:28:00,516
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

218
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:04,776
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

219
00:28:04,776 --> 00:28:14,446
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

220
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:21,085
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

221
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:34,856
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

222
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,346
everything for yourself.

223
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:52,455
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

224
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,966
the past or the future, but in the present.

225
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:58,085
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

226
00:28:58,085 --> 00:29:09,266
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

227
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:15,416
and from them to all of us.

228
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:19,886
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

229
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:33,276
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

230
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:45,716
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

231
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:52,185
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

232
00:29:52,185 --> 00:30:02,916
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

233
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,916
you?”

234
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,636
There’s no shame in it.

235
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:18,376
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

236
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:26,506
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

237
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:29,955
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

238
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:35,226
Is not good manners.

239
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:45,846
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

240
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:50,396
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

241
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:52,396
How can you ask?

242
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:56,756
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

243
00:30:56,756 --> 00:31:03,856
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

244
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:05,425
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

245
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:14,016
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

246
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:15,016
matter?

247
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:21,239
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

248
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,239
night.

249
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:27,886
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

250
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,886
precious.

251
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:37,685
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

252
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:38,685
records.

253
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:41,016
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

254
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:44,426
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

255
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:53,006
What’s the use of informing the police?”

256
00:31:53,006 --> 00:32:05,466
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

257
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:10,146
is worse than any disease that is possible.

258
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:18,886
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

259
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:23,786
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

260
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:29,436
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

261
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:32,546
like malaria or something.

262
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:41,526
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

263
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,836
you.

264
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:47,046
For example, it started a fashion.

265
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,846
With this materialism they start fashions.

266
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:54,356
Ladies are more vulnerable.

267
00:32:54,356 --> 00:33:02,236
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

268
00:33:02,236 --> 00:33:09,866
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

269
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,636
I said, “I am not running that race.

270
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:16,805
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

271
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:22,606
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

272
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:27,856
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

273
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:31,156
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

274
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:37,916
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

275
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,666
Now new race has started, run with it.

276
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,506
Then another race has started, run with it.

277
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:48,466
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

278
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:53,335
of fashions.

279
00:33:53,335 --> 00:34:00,386
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

280
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,786
bald, then you buy wigs.

281
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:08,976
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

282
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:20,986
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

283
00:34:20,986 --> 00:34:25,526
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

284
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:28,896
Goes on like mad.

285
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:40,936
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

286
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,956
people want to make some money.

287
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:48,506
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

288
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:53,206
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

289
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:59,706
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

290
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:06,496
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

291
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:11,706
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

292
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:21,086
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

293
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,116
you see.

294
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:27,796
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

295
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:33,616
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

296
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:42,096
I thought she was some priest or someone!

297
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:45,316
So that stupidity has started.

298
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:55,416
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

299
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,376
stupid people are going.

300
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:07,556
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

301
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:14,116
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

302
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:16,166
is changed, giving you such a headache.

303
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,046
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

304
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,276
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

305
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:22,816
What is – this is the fashion now.

306
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,716
All right, wear this dress.”

307
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:30,986
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

308
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:41,776
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

309
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:47,696
It’s nothing important.

310
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:53,586
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

311
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,016
know what else, but white or black.

312
00:36:56,016 --> 00:37:03,836
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

313
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:04,836
completely black.

314
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,836
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

315
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:08,286
I didn’t know what to do.

316
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,436
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

317
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,906
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

318
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:18,646
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

319
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:25,926
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

320
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:33,706
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

321
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:39,566
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

322
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:42,436
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

323
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:48,546
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

324
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:54,386
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

325
00:37:54,386 --> 00:38:01,186
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

326
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:07,816
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

327
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:11,326
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

328
00:38:11,326 --> 00:38:20,136
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

329
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:27,396
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

330
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:35,906
values, to something nonsensical.

331
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:44,676
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

332
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:51,916
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

333
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:58,066
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

334
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:03,296
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

335
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:04,506
own baby.

336
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:12,926
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

337
00:39:12,926 --> 00:39:18,436
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

338
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:24,026
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

339
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:30,266
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

340
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:36,616
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

341
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:40,476
to be yours.

342
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:45,206
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

343
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:53,216
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

344
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:58,346
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

345
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:07,416
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

346
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:13,136
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

347
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:16,646
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

348
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:26,966
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

349
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:32,646
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

350
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:36,376
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

351
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:37,526
in our hand.”

352
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:42,716
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

353
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:48,596
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

354
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:54,516
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

355
00:40:54,516 --> 00:41:00,616
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

356
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:08,996
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

357
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:18,606
So She is Leela Vinodini.

358
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:27,136
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

359
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:33,796
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

360
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:37,526
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

361
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:43,406
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

362
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:47,036
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

363
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:55,356
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

364
00:41:55,356 --> 00:42:00,786
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

365
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:08,206
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

366
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:13,246
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

367
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:22,096
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

368
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:28,916
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

369
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:36,556
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

370
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:40,756
your family, within every one of you.

371
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:45,136
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

372
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:51,396
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

373
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:56,686
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

374
00:42:56,686 --> 00:43:00,066
world – what to do, how to help them?

375
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:06,106
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

376
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:08,576
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

377
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:14,766
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

378
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:18,256
spreading so much horizontally.

379
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:22,946
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

380
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:27,766
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

381
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:34,946
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

382
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,476
be there.

383
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:41,706
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

384
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:47,056
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

385
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:55,896
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

386
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:59,336
who have to receive this great blessing.

387
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:05,836
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

388
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:07,116
did not receive it.

389
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:13,146
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

390
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:21,826
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

391
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:22,826
your own caliber.

392
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:28,086
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

393
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:34,406
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

394
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:42,506
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

395
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,526
We are not reactionaries.

396
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:52,346
And things will disappear which are harmful.

397
00:44:52,346 --> 00:44:57,973
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing

398
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:00,872
in our own perfection, in our own glory.

399
00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:02,435
What do we need?

400
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,599
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

401
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,412
May God bless you all.
