00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:08,667
Adi Shakti Puja

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,709
2004, Cabella Ligure, Ä°talya

3
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:50,875
Today's meeting is very special.

4
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,041
It's a very, very special day also,

5
00:05:55,208 --> 00:06:02,542
extremely special and very blissful.

6
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:12,542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

7
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:25,542
about the born Order

8
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:32,125
born Power,

9
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:40,750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

10
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,041
And this one is responsible

11
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,959
for creating this great universe.

12
00:06:54,834 --> 00:07:02,083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

13
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,667
already you know;

14
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,291
I need not talk about that.

15
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

16
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,667
which is hidden in your hearts,

17
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:24,667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

18
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

19
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,291
everything that is not known so far.

20
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:41,375
That is quite possible;

21
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:48,458
that is quite possible and is being done,

22
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:52,542
but what is difficult is

23
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:59,417
how to make people more adaptable, more

24
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:09,250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

25
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:15,250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

26
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,959
They're all right among themselves,

27
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:23,083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

28
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:30,166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

29
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:36,709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

30
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,625
and it should not be done.

31
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,375
That's not supposed to be;

32
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,458
they're not supposed to be like that,

33
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:50,458
but it has to work out.

34
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,959
Now the problem is,

35
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:01,291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

36
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,959
but they do not become

37
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,583
so one with each other as they should have.

38
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,125
Now, how to solve this problem?

39
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,083
Many people have asked Me,

40
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:20,166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

41
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,834
I just smiled.

42
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:26,792
Because, if you see the original idea

43
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:36,375
why we started this x ray

44
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,500
why we started this new kind of a

45
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:51,083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

46
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:58,875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

47
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,417
in every person.

48
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:07,417
Now you should be very much thankful that

49
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:12,208
you are all one, one inside,

50
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,375
there's nothing second.

51
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:20,333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

52
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:26,250
and when it wants to administer something,

53
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

54
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:36,792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

55
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:42,750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

56
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:51,500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

57
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,875
roving into some sort of a problem,

58
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

59
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:06,083
Now the main problem that we have is that

60
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

61
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,625
We are without any problems.

62
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,667
We think that there are problems and

63
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,583
we should deal with problems,

64
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

65
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

66
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,458
Those who think they have problems,

67
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,875
I've asked them to write it down,

68
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,959
and I'll try to answer them

69
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

70
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:38,166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

71
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

72
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

73
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:55,083
in their hearts of their oneness.

74
00:11:55,291 --> 00:12:02,375
All this comes from within, not from without,

75
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

76
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:13,417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

77
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

78
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:24,333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

79
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,959
any other coding something,

80
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,166
no need; it's all there.

81
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

82
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

83
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:43,166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

84
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,083
to become the same.

85
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,709
But you are, you are; because

86
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:52,041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

87
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

88
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:04,792
One in the sense that your everything,

89
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,583
impulse, every feeling,

90
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:17,583
every understanding is the same.

91
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

92
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

93
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

94
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,375
It is only one, one relationship,

95
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:42,709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

96
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:47,959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

97
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,959
that whatever one may try,

98
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

99
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

100
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,125
you are looked after (by) Her.

101
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,083
Everything seems to be one to Me

102
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,875
while you people think there is a different

103
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

104
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:20,000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

105
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:27,500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

106
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,500
Myself, I am one with you

107
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

108
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:46,166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

109
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:50,917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

110
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

111
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,625
depends on your temperament.

112
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

113
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,500
you will see the oneness among all of you

114
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

115
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:15,500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

116
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

117
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:25,750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

118
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,500
Why? Because I never understood him.

119
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:35,625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

120
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

121
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:43,542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

122
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

123
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:52,500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

124
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:59,959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

125
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,709
So, the truth started long time back,

126
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:11,667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

127
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:19,750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

128
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,834
and then the truth went away.

129
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

130
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:32,500
snake was born out of ignorance

131
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,041
that the other snakes started supporting.

132
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:40,834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

133
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

134
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:52,166
and believing in it and started fighting,

135
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

136
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:02,041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

137
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:05,500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

138
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:11,000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

139
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,834
It's very difficult.

140
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

141
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:24,917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

142
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,583
Why?

143
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

144
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,417
Our own understanding is untruth

145
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

146
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:43,417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

147
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

148
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,792
Should not, but it happens.

149
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,291
So that means there is something wrong

150
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

151
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

152
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

153
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,875
We cannot face ourselves.

154
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,083
We face others, not ourselves.

155
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,166
We never see ourselves.

156
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:20,291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

157
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:25,333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

158
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,709
And that's how the Mother came here

159
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:35,208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

160
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:41,166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

161
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

162
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,959
how much you have already a knowledge

163
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

164
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:56,125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

165
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

166
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:08,583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

167
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,667
but they are not.

168
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:14,333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

169
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

170
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,500
and they don't have to become anything.

171
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,750
Then there's no problem.

172
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,125
But when you have accepted that there is

173
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

174
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,917
and you are different,

175
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

176
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:43,083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

177
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:47,709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

178
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

179
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,417
all the same, very much.

180
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

181
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:03,333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

182
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,125
will be solved without any difficulty.

183
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,500
Today's Puja is a special one

184
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,125
because you are doing the Puja of something

185
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,333
that never went into any transformation,

186
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:22,250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

187
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:27,417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

188
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:31,875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

189
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,166
Why anyone has to say?

190
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

191
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,333
That's the point we come to

192
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

193
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,041
and not to get it lost in the words

194
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:53,917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

195
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

196
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:02,000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

198
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,959
there's no danger;

199
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

200
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:18,291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

201
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

202
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:29,041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

203
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

204
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

205
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

206
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:45,500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

207
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:49,166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

208
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

209
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:59,709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

210
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

211
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,083
But we are not.

212
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

213
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:17,458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
