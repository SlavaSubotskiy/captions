1
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:12,770
Now for puja, one has to understand that without
Realisation, puja has no meaning, because

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,680
you are not ananya.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:26,610
Is, you have to become aware of your whole.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,340
Krishna’s description of Bhakti is ananya.

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:42,780
He says, “I will give you ananya bhakti”,
He wants ananya bhakti, means when there is

6
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,800
not the other, means when we are realised.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,370
Otherwise He says “Pushpam, phalam toyum”
(Bhagavad Gita verse 26) “A flower, a fruit

8
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:04,600
and a water: whatever you give me I accept”
But when it comes to giving, He says, “You

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:13,280
have to come to Me with ananya bhakti,”
means: when you have become 

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,210
one with Me, then you should have the devotion,
not before that.

11
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,640
Before that, you are not connected.

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,439
Now puja is the left hand side projection.

13
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,250
It’s the neutralisation of the right side,
very much.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,020
Specially for people who are very right handed,
atmosphere which is very right handed, puja

15
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,969
is ideal for them.

16
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:51,840
Is the bhakti, is the devotion…that you
project.

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:08,530
Now what happens actually when you project
this puja?

18
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,800
It has been found out, and now as I am telling
you, that first you have to awaken within

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:22,630
you the Deities that are still asleep, by
worshipping them.

20
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:31,640
But as these Deities, Primordial Deities,
are with Me, you worship Me, and every Deity

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,590
in Me is awakened, by which your Deities are
awakened.

22
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,070
So first, your vibrations must improve, to
receive.

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:49,290
If the reception is not good what’s the
use of any puja or projection?

24
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,630
So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument,
or prepare our projecting instrument.

25
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:07,010
That preparation is done by praying to different
Deities, as we call that: a Kundalini puja.

26
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,390
By praying to My Kundalini you improve your
reflection.

27
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:22,230
Because then the vibrations from Me start
flowing into yours and they awaken it.

28
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:31,680
This is the projection as far as you are concerned.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,570
Once the instrument is alright, then you project
outside.

30
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,500
And now how do you project?

31
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:58,490
By worshipping the Goddess as the Protector
of the whole Universe, praising Her different

32
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:08,850
attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything
has a meaning.

33
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,960
Praising Her Powers.

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:22,500
By saying that, by repeating that, you echo
in your projection Her Powers, and then your

35
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,540
projection becomes that powerful.

36
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:33,290
It’s a very subtle happening that takes
place, it’s miraculous.

37
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:40,850
These things look so simple, like just like
washing my Feet.

38
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,100
Simple thing is washing my Feet.

39
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,600
Now see these Feet, I don’t know if you
see, the whole Universe I see there and I

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,530
really get stunned by them.

41
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,140
When you wash My Feet, what do you do?

42
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,490
Actually, My Feet have been working very hard.

43
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:11,630
And then you put a little water to soothe
them, to suggest that you can feel the effort

44
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,870
put in by these Feet.

45
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:20,990
And a kind of a very sweet, melodious love
flows out of these Feet there.

46
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,060
Like today I was coming, and I suddenly saw
Paul (Winter) standing.

47
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,080
Same thing happened to me.

48
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,110
See, what a care it is, what an understanding,
“Mother is coming, She should not be lost!”

49
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,120
Just that, and the thing started melting.

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:49,080
Because this love who understands everything,
doesn’t want anything, but is only excited

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,960
if there is somebody to receive the love.

52
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,620
Now how do you say you are going to receive?

53
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,610
By expressing these small-small things.

54
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:09,460
So when you soothe My Feet, wash Them, clean
Them, you know what They mean: you recognise.

55
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,919
That recognition, how are you to show?

56
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,889
You see, these ceremonies, little ceremonies
are important because they express your recognition.

57
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:25,810
It could be absolutely dull, dead and finished,
and it could be absolutely living, if you

58
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,120
know why you are doing it.

59
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:37,560
Then you apply some oil and things [to] again
soothe My Feet.

60
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,970
Just say, “Mother, You have worked very
hard, Your Feet have worked very hard."

61
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,670
Just saying that itself, I mean makes no difference
otherwise, if you say in a very rational manner,

62
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,840
but to that Love that are these Feet it makes
a very big difference.

63
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,520
There is sweetness: a little thing, a little
baby just puts her hand on her mother’s

64
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,949
cheeks, you see, just to express the gratitude,
and the mother’s heart starts jumping with

65
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:12,949
love.

66
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:23,790
It is a very reciprocal behaviour, it’s
very subtle and that kind of a subtle working

67
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:33,270
is fixed already: it works that way only.

68
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,930
The more you love from your heart, the more
the joy will be there.

69
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:45,220
The more you are rational and more mental,
there won’t be so much joy.

70
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,330
It should be [that] first of all your cleansing
is important but the projection should be

71
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,240
towards your Mother, that is the height.

72
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:10,130
Once you achieve that height, then you become
all-powerful, and then you can give to others.

73
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:21,150
But that giving is nothing but is a very,
very, as I told you is a very mutual and absolutely

74
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,150
reciprocal.

75
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,830
Because the Devi knows about you, everything.

76
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,460
If you are trying anything else, She knows
and She will also tell you frankly that this

77
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,289
should not be done, that should not be done,
should not be done, clearly, so that you do

78
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,579
not be under any misunderstandings about it.

79
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:46,149
But still, to work it out, you must know it
has to be reciprocal, it cannot be one-sided.

80
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:58,699
The sincerity cannot be one-sided, it has
to be both sides, then it works out better.

81
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:10,850
And a kind of a homogeneous feeling with that
Love comes in, sort of a lubricant, a beautiful

82
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,610
feeling of movement within yourself comes
in.

83
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,009
Puja really is the triggering thing, it triggers
you.

84
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:30,160
It triggers you into another realm, it’s
really miraculous.

85
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,430
Once you have done the puja then you can project
out, much more, in your silence only.

86
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,620
Your silence itself becomes so powerful.

87
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:49,199
Now in this special case of our Western lives,
we have to established our innocence, very

88
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:55,220
important, it is the first thing that is attacked,
innocence is attacked by so many things.

89
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,269
So we have to established our innocence.

90
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,740
And innocence is the most powerful thing:
it doesn’t see anything bad, it doesn’t

91
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,069
see anything wrong, it doesn’t see anything…It
loves, just goes on loving, innocence.

92
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,740
A child doesn’t know that the mother hates
the child.

93
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,059
The child doesn’t know if anybody hates.

94
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,819
In innocence they live.

95
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:26,110
And then they suddenly discover sometimes,
they are shocked, how people are!

96
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,920
They don’t love!

97
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,730
They don’t love.

98
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,570
So Ganesha is very important for the Western
countries, very important, because that’s

99
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:46,110
the essence of everything, I think, that’s
the most essential thing.

100
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,790
That’s why we worship Ganesha first.

101
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:59,069
And Ganesha was created first of all, because
He is the eldest son, He’s the first son.

102
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:15,310
He’s the eldest brother you have, and though
Kumara (Kartikeya) is treated as an elder

103
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:24,589
brother always, while Ganesha calls Himself
as a younger brother, though He was the first

104
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,279
created!

105
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
Because He remains young always, never grows.

106
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,420
So in a way, He’s always younger to you
also.

107
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,319
It’s a very, very subtle understanding:
a very young little thing is so much wiser.

108
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,319
He is wisdom.

109
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,470
Can you imagine a little baby is so intelligent.

110
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,350
A little baby so wise?

111
00:11:49,350 --> 00:12:01,410
Much more, He’s like a grown-up little baby,
a very matured, wise, little baby.

112
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:13,639
So by age, you are always older than Him,
but by wisdom, He is the eldest.

113
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,379
Then like this you should understand how we
evoke all the Deities within us by doing these

114
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,279
small things, by saying Their mantras.

115
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,589
Because now you are awakened, every word you
say is awakened now, is siddha mantra.

116
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:37,519
On this Guru puja I’m really going to give
you the way of how to do the siddhartha is

117
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:49,509
the establishment of the siddha.

118
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,709
To master.

119
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:57,079
To master every chakra and every deity bestowed
upon it.

120
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,259
To master it, how to do it, I will tell you
this Guru puja no doubt.

121
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,679
Going to work it out.

122
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:15,189
But this puja is to be done with full understanding,
and with full recognition that it’s a great

123
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:16,199
fortune.

124
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,290
Even the Devas are jealous of you, all the
rishis are jealous of you, so many people

125
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,250
are jealous of you.

126
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,610
The greatest advantage for you, greatest fortune.

127
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,029
Make full use of it.

128
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,439
And they are very simple things that can please,
very simple.

129
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:43,079
You know your Mother can be pleased with very,
very simple things.

130
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,850
It’s like that only.

131
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,610
It’s how much heart you have put into it,
is the point.

132
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,689
I think tomorrow we should have the puja,
today we have understood about it.

133
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:01,279
It is more to be felt and understood and realised
than to be thought about.

134
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,689
Because you’ll go into thoughtless awareness.

135
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,089
It is more source of triggering.

136
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:12,509
For example, I think I’ll ask Hari (Jairam)
to give the miracle we had yesterday, would

137
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,790
be [a] good idea.

138
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:22,179
On our way we were coming, from…he was losing
his way throughout, and Regis (Camille) was

139
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:28,059
navigating him (laughter) so we were all lost!

140
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:34,980
But then we had a miracle while coming back:
there was in M1 (road) a complete jam and

141
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,470
miles together we could see there is no movement.

142
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,550
And suddenly, within two minutes, what happened,
what I told him, and how he worked it out.

143
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,100
Hari has a problem you see, I think Felicity
(Payment) has the same mad problem.

144
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Where is she?

145
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Is she there?

146
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Yes?

147
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,569
You see, like, to get after everything, to
do it…

148
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,579
Now he thought that I have told that you put
your attention inside.

149
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:06,850
Now he has a slope in his left side, as she
has too, and when you do it too much inside,

150
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,529
you go on the slope.

151
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:13,799
So Hari being a wiser person in this respect
because he’s not been a psychologist, he

152
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,079
does not do that much, but Felicity does that,
is to go over do it.

153
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,110
I mean she goes down very very deep into her
subconscious.

154
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,320
While Hari understands there’s something’s
going wrong.

155
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,769
I never said that you get after anything.

156
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,859
Now, “put your attention inside” means:
if you get Realisation by that.

157
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,689
If you don’t get Realisation, there’s
something wrong somewhere, you have lost your

158
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,690
way, that’s the main point is.

159
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,369
So I told Hari that, “You don’t put your
attention inside because you go on the slope,

160
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:51,929
your car is such that it doesn’t go the
other way round, it goes into the slope, doesn’t

161
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,819
go to the heart.

162
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:00,730
So best thing is that now you [should] become
active outside and forget about it (the inside).

163
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,279
And after some time you’ll receive a balance."

164
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,079
I said “At this point.."

165
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,279
Now he was trying to worry about the traffic.

166
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,279
The other Mr.

167
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,199
‘Navigator’ (Regis) was also busy worrying
about it!

168
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:17,810
So I said, “Now, just now, you do not pay
any attention anywhere, you just project outside

169
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,829
and think of everyone, how we are going to
get them realised” Only I said like this,

170
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:24,829
and he started doing it.

171
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,639
I said, “You never see the trees, you never
do this” And then what happened?

172
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,639
You tell.

173
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,639
Within 2 minutes time?

174
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,170
Everybody, Chaya (Camille, Regis’ wife)
was there, all of them.

175
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,709
Suddenly they found that the whole M1 (road)
was empty and they were rushing fast, you

176
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,709
see.

177
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,139
There was not, hardly one or two cars.

178
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,319
The whole M1 was emptied, absolutely!

179
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,500
And they did not know how it happened.

180
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,850
Just they were there.

181
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,339
And none of the things that we were going….

182
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,109
Ray Harris: Was that yesterday afternoon on
the M1 Mother?

183
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,239
Shri Mataji: Not today, yesterday

184
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,239
Ray: Yesterday.

185
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:05,010
Because I was on a coach there, and we were
in the traffic jam.

186
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,139
Shri Mataji: Means you were in the traffic
jam! (laughter) The whole traffic jam

187
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:16,779
Ray: We were 1 mile from the exit and it stopped
dead.

188
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:22,720
And then we stayed there and suddenly it cleared
and there were no cars! (laughter)

189
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,579
Shri Mataji: Suddenly the whole thing cleared
up!

190
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,309
And suddenly, and they realised, and they
didn’t know how it cleared up.

191
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,740
He speeded the car, I said “How?”

192
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,960
He said, “The car, I don’t know” and
all the things that were in front of us, and

193
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,340
all that, God knows where they disappeared
[to]!

194
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,850
Such huge big things and on the sides and
this and that.

195
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,980
Nothing!

196
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,130
This is what is maya that upsets you.

197
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,530
Project yourself outside.

198
00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:00,530
There was another experience I told these
people was this: that there were two journalists,

199
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,530
one Mr.

200
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,399
Marathe and a friend who are Sahaja Yogis,
and I went to the journalist’s association,

201
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:06,880
they had a meeting.

202
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,059
And there is another one who told Me, “No,
no Mother I have complete faith in You because

203
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,070
there was a miracle that happened to a friend
of mine, Marathe, who is a Sahaja Yogi."

204
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,200
I said, “What happened?”

205
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:25,470
He said they were coming, by, from Poona down
to Bombay, and their brakes failed, and the

206
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,350
slopes, you see, on the ghats (mountains),
it moves very fast.

207
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,240
And suddenly they saw a huge big truck coming
up, with all the lights on top, and they didn’t

208
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,159
know how to control, and they were about to
dash out.

209
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,659
Just they closed their eyes and they said,
“Now, Mother, save us!”

210
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:48,110
And suddenly they found that the car had crossed
the thing, and the thing was moving upwards,

211
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,140
the truck was moving.

212
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,600
They didn’t know, as if somebody had picked
up that car and put it on the other side.

213
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,910
So these miracles can work out in case you
project yourself out.

214
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,630
But for projecting outside, first you should
be cleansed inside.

215
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,210
But for that also, all the time if your attention
[is like this -] “where am I catching?”

216
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,720
Then you go onto rationality.

217
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,929
“I must be catching because of this, I must
be catching because of that."

218
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:24,850
I have told you hundred times not to say ‘why’.

219
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,590
Give up this word ‘why’.

220
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,580
“Why am I catching?”

221
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,570
It will settle down.

222
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,110
This maddening must go away!

223
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,820
You cannot answer ‘why’ of anything in
Sahaja Yoga, can you?

224
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,210
“Why did I meet you?”, “Why did you
get Realisation?”

225
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:54,760
Ask hundred questions, two hundred, three
hundred, five hundred – you will not have

226
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
any answer!

227
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,350
So give up that.

228
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:08,990
It’s not your rationality, it’s the Grace,
it’s the whim of the Grace that’s working

229
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,760
it out!

230
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:21,090
What are you trying at?

231
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,950
Just ask for the Grace.

232
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
Finished!

233
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,950
It’s silent.

234
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,950
It works out.

235
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,950
This is maddening!

236
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,950
You’ll become mad people.

237
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,429
This is the greatest madness that people want
to know why of everything.

238
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,960
How can you understand?

239
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,380
You don’t have that chitti to understand
it.

240
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,221
“[Mother] Can you explain?”

241
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,221
How can I?

242
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:43,400
If you make a little ant understand human
civilisation and this dirty politics you play

243
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
it may understand.

244
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
But you cannot understand ‘why’ of God.

245
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,380
This is the relationship.

246
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,960
So now, you give it up asking questions like
that.

247
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,940
It’s too tremendous for this rationality.

248
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,340
“Why God is doing?

249
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,649
How He does?

250
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:04,940
What are His powers?”

251
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,519
Only thing [you can do] as scientists, you
note down – “Yes, it is so, yes, it is

252
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,320
so, yes it is so."

253
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,789
Verify it and note down.

254
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,820
Only your awareness is changed from the scientist,
that you can see subtler working.

255
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,110
But why it works?

256
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,110
That’s His whim!

257
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,110
He’ll do what He likes!

258
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,940
Who are you to question God?

259
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,260
How can you question God?

260
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:37,410
Just give up asking this question ‘why’
and you will feel very much better.

261
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,330
“It is God, you see, He does it!”

262
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,640
This is what is faith.

263
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,500
Not the blind, but real [faith], with understanding.

264
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,509
I have told you this story of My grandmother
many a times, as she used to tell Me about

265
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,919
faith, and which I have repeated to you so
many times, but again I’ll repeat it today:

266
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,750
There were three people at different places,
and one man was going to see God.

267
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,960
So they came to know about it.

268
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,200
So one of them was in the forest, standing
on his head, doing all kinds of yogas and

269
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,529
things like that, and praying to God – must
be with both hands towards Him, and soaking

270
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:28,360
the feet, may be – like mad, you see, and
asking, “Why don’t You meet me?

271
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,980
Why don’t You meet me?

272
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,529
I want to meet You! why don’t you meet me?”

273
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,000
And the man who was going to see God went
through that side, and He said, “Now please

274
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
go and ask Him why don’t You come and see
me?

275
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,519
You better come and see me, Why don’t You
do it?”

276
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:50,299
So he said, “Alright, I’ll come, I’m
sorry” He had become thin, you see, absolutely

277
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,720
thinned down, condition very miserable.

278
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,700
He said, “Alright, I’ll go and tell God
about you."

279
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,440
So, then he went up to God, no, no, before
that.

280
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:14,909
Then he met another type who was sitting on
the street, and will be at the street side,

281
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:15,909
and he said, “Oh!

282
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,419
I heard you are going to meet God?”

283
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,769
He said: yes, he is going to meet God.

284
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:24,880
So he said, “Then communicate one small
little thing."

285
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,940
He said, “What?”

286
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:36,360
He said that, “Just tell Him I have had
no food, please send me my food now, I’m

287
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
hungry."

288
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,440
He said “What?”

289
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,070
“Yes, you just tell Him that much."

290
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,070
So he went up.

291
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,070
He saw God.

292
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,070
So God asked, “Did you meet some people
on your way?”

293
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,570
He said, “Yes, I met a horrible one who
is all time saying ‘Why not?

294
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,570
Why this?”

295
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,789
And “Why?”, “Should I do it and should
I not?’

296
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,149
And this and that, is going on.

297
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,011
So, will You go and meet him?

298
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:58,011
He’s asking."

299
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:03,419
He (God) said, “No, better tell him to do
it little more, you see… still he has to

300
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,419
do.

301
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,419
He requires more effort.

302
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,419
He won’t be satisfied.

303
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,730
Till he gives up his efforts, let him go on."

304
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,350
I mean he would have become mad like that.

305
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,830
But now God says, “Alright, let him go ahead!

306
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,830
What to do?

307
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,830
If you tell them, they don’t want to listen,
so let them go ahead."

308
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,200
Then he said, “Then I met another mad fellow,
who was on the street, he said that ‘ I’m

309
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,410
hungry, ask God to send some food for me.

310
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,410
Please ask.

311
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,510
Tell God that I’m hungry.’

312
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,510
” He (God) said, “Really?”

313
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,510
He called all His managers He said, “Please
send his food.

314
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,510
Have you not yet arranged his food and all
that?

315
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,510
Please arrange it."

316
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,100
He was quite surprised.

317
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,160
He said, “What is this?

318
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,730
This man is just telling ‘I’m hungry’,
and God is so much worried about this fellow

319
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,549
and not worried about the fellow who is standing
on his head and asking such a lot of questions

320
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,549
to God."

321
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:53,330
So God knows everything, so He told him, “Now,
alright you are going down, you just tell

322
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,490
them one story to both of them, and see their
reactions, and then you will know."

323
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,330
So He told him a story.

324
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:08,330
“You tell them that, ‘I went to God and
saw there, God passing a camel through the

325
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,409
eye of a needle.’ ” and he said, “Really?”

326
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:17,010
He said, “Yes, you go and tell them."

327
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,750
So he came down.

328
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,790
This fellow was still on his head.

329
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,840
He came back, “What did God say?”

330
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,360
He said you have to go on still for some time."

331
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
He said, “Oh!

332
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Really?

333
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Well all glory to God!”

334
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,380
He said, “Yes, he said so."

335
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
He said, “Really?”

336
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,149
Then, “Did you see something special there?”

337
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,509
He said, “Yes, I saw that He passed a camel
through the eye of a needle!”

338
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,299
He said, “No, no, don’t tell me stories!

339
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,200
How can it?

340
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,340
Such a big camel!

341
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,890
How can it pass through the eye?

342
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,559
After all it’s impossible!

343
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,809
It is impossible!

344
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,059
This is impossible!

345
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,440
You are just now trying to befool me.

346
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,470
Because you have been to God you think you
can befool me.

347
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,200
No, no, I cannot take it, no, I cannot take
it!”

348
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,539
So he went to another fellow, he was nicely
eating his food.

349
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,620
He said, “Yes!

350
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,980
I knew, you see, I just told you because you
asked me if you have to tell you anything,

351
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,389
I knew God will send my food and everything.

352
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,460
I’m quite alright."

353
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,059
He said, “Did you see anything wondrous
there?”

354
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:25,289
He said, “I saw the wonder of wonders, miracles
of miracles, that God passed a camel through

355
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,570
the eye of a needle!”

356
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,230
He said, “What is so miraculous?

357
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,230
He is God!

358
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,230
He’s God Almighty!

359
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,230
What?

360
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,929
He can pass even Universes after Universes
through that hole!

361
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,970
What is it for God?

362
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,799
He is God Almighty don’t you understand
God Almighty?

363
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,200
Because you have met Him, you think He’s
nothing!

364
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,640
Because you did it so easily, you think He’s
nothing!

365
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,509
Because He behaves like [that] you think He’s
nothing!

366
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,240
He’s God Almighty!

367
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,409
So what?

368
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,700
to Him, what is it?”

369
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,509
Then 
he realised.

370
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:02,509
This is Faith.

371
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,799
That is what is enlightened within you with
puja.

372
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,100
Not your rationality which is brought down
actually quite a lot.

373
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:16,840
So with this idea, tomorrow, we’ll have
the puja, alright?

374
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,330
May God Bless You.

375
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:31,440
Sahaja Yogi: Jane just started labour, for
the baby.

376
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,929
Shri Mataji: Has started?

377
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,299
Good, good, good.

378
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,789
It will work out.

379
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:51,529
In Jane’s case she never wanted a baby – big
problem, you see.

380
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:57,720
Funny ideas about children are developing
in this horrible country, which is so shocking,

381
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,279
so shocking.

382
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,249
I mean the mother is the one who should have
feelings.

383
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:10,509
Every day you read such horrible stories about
these mother’s.

384
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:11,730
Can’t imagine!

385
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:18,830
They can be so cruel?

386
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,750
The more I read about these things, one can’t
understand.

387
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,690
How can they be cruel?

388
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:33,679
I mean if you hear a little thorn has gone
into the feet of a child your heart starts

389
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,990
melting, you know.

390
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:44,309
Innocence, is attack on innocence.

391
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,179
The whole country is after innocence.

392
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:55,549
Is old men running after young girls, all
this is attack on innocence.

393
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean, extremely satanic, very satanic forces
are let loose.

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:15,250
They are attacking all the children of the
world and everything.

395
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
Yogini: Would You like some tea, Mother?

396
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,250
Would you like some tea?

397
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,110
Shri Mataji: No, but I think we’ll have
food.

398
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,200
Better to have food.

399
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,120
I’ve got some food for you.

400
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:36,210
Heat it up and I hope you’ll like it.

401
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,179
Now.

402
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,809
Got something for her.

403
00:29:43,809 --> 00:30:03,820
Can you imagine where people are killing their
wives, their husbands?

404
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,549
Yesterday, today, My husband was telling Me
there was a case where a wife was killed and

405
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,539
was put in the fridge, deep freeze.

406
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:14,139
Can you imagine?

407
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:18,789
And then Peter (Pierce) told another story
that a lady delivered her child in the loo

408
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,509
and left the child [to] die there.

409
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,840
I mean, this kind of people can you imagine?

410
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,519
They have only sex-love and a sort of dirty
feelings for others, they have never good,

411
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,039
pure feelings for anyone else.

412
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,570
What should you say to such people?

413
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,590
I just can’t understand.

414
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,600
Very destructive.

415
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Satanic.

416
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,480
You see but there must be something satanic
in people to accept such satanic things.

417
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,659
I mean I cannot think of one case in India
– one case – where a mother could kill

418
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:48,659
the child.

419
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,149
One case I cannot think.

420
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:54,960
Even if it’s a illegitimate child she would
not like to kill but others may like to finish

421
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,549
it off.

422
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:01,320
That’s different, but she would not.

423
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,470
I mean just can’t think of such a thing.

424
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,470
Unbelievable!

425
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,470
Unbelievable.

426
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,830
They are so egoistical, so foolish.

427
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,830
Donkeys they could be only.

428
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:20,759
At the most donkeys are like that, I think,
that’s why Christ rode on the donkeys.

429
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,110
Donkeys, are they egoistical?

430
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,970
I don’t think so, they are not.

431
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:35,480
Moreover they are not also full of hatred,
donkeys are not full of hatred.

432
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,840
They are stupid people.

433
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,409
You see, somebody must bully them then they
are alright.

434
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:49,330
The bullying starts like this: a French bullies
English, I have seen it, puts them down.

435
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:55,340
French think they are higher than the [English].

436
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,009
See the gradation is in the opposite direction.

437
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:01,740
They think that the English are lower; I think
definitely English are better than French

438
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,889
as far as evolution is concerned, but the
French have put them down.

439
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,159
Yesterday I met – there was one Bangladeshi
who was going back to Bangladesh.

440
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,730
He says, “Many have gone from here.

441
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,899
People don’t know how many have gone; if
they write it down they’ll be amazed, because

442
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:20,899
they are fed up."

443
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,740
And funny, funny things, you see he told Me,
he lived with four types of neighbours and

444
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,900
he got so fed up with them.

445
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,860
First neighbour he lived with, you see, he
said that, “He had a daughter and I had

446
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,809
a daughter of the same age, 14 years of age.

447
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,369
And he [the Englishman] said ‘Why shouldn’t
we exchange our daughters, you see, for lovemaking?’

448
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,269
“ He got so angry and he ran away.

449
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,190
Shri Mataji laughing: How can he?

450
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,940
This was the first thing.

451
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,490
Then the second one was, he said that, You
see, his daughter was – little nausea she

452
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,559
had or something.

453
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,340
She’s just 14 or something.

454
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,039
So she went to the doctor and doctor said,
“Did you – have you start giving her [contraceptive]

455
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,309
pills and things, you see?”

456
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,330
This upset him absolutely then.

457
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,919
Like that he gave Me four horrible instances,
the two others I cannot tell you to what extent

458
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,919
it is.

459
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,909
He said, “I’m not going to live in this
country."

460
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:18,730
I mean, they are just like stud-bulls going
round, I tell you – horrible.

461
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,190
And the women I don’t know what to call
them!

462
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,190
What is the parallel?

463
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,309
(laughing) Hawkers?

464
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,509
Or what?

465
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,710
The Hawks?

466
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,499
What do you call the other side?

467
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:29,639
Yogini: Hookers.

468
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,340
Shri Mataji: Hooker?

469
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Hookers.

470
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,320
Yogini: They get paid for it.

471
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,029
Shri Mataji: Ha?

472
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,389
Yogini: They get paid for it.

473
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:39,389
Shri Mataji: They get paid for.

474
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:40,389
Yes they get paid for.

475
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:49,690
Shri Mataji: At least they can have a date
and have some nice food somewhere in the Chinese.

476
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,000
(laughing).

477
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,730
Selling their chastity for cheap things.

478
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,140
Different community altogether.

479
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,990
It’s a very nice picture, eh?

480
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:20,640
There’s only a Radha and Krishna both together
in One Being.

481
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,160
You have got of My eyes in many of My photographs.

482
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,929
Some of these are.What is this one about?

483
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,210
Really terrible.

484
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,140
Ramadan, you see.

485
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,270
Yesterday I must tell you, where is he?

486
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,200
(Djamel) Yesterday Ramadan.

487
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:44,850
Yesterday these Muslims came in, you see,
they were waiting for 8 [O’clock], something

488
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,430
time, you see?

489
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,410
And then they started drinking like hell,
I mean they drank so much of (laughter).

490
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,060
By the way why did they do it?

491
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,960
In the daytime what happened?

492
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,740
What is the story?

493
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,080
Djamel Metouri: Why do they do it?

494
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,920
What do they do during the daytime?

495
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,893
Shri Mataji: No-no-no-no no, no, why – what
is the story, why did they fast?

496
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:10,893
Djamel: Well it’s for the Koran, the Prophet
Mohammed decided that every year there should

497
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:11,893
be a time when all the people should fast
to keep all their ?

498
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:12,893
at bay.

499
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:18,690
Akbar: To keep all the attentions at bay.

500
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,550
Shri Mataji: They should fast – what…?

501
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,280
Yogi: They should fast for one month because
they have for at least one month in a year

502
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,160
to keep away, You know, temptation from drinking
and…

503
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,720
Because at the time they were very licentious,
You know they used to –

504
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,120
Shri Mataji: Dining and wining!

505
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:55,540
Djamel: Well they do still, but at the time
they were much more.

506
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,550
Shri Mataji: They used to drink like anything.

507
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,960
So He said, “You better fast for one month,
because He thought if you put one month, at

508
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
least for one day they will do it.

509
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
(Laughter)

510
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,700
You see this is how, you have to put an extreme
case, you see?

511
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,030
But people say that, “Why they put an extreme
case?”

512
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,250
Because, you see if you put an extreme case
then at least symbolically you’ll do for

513
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,560
one day or half a day.

514
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,350
That was the reason, you see, because they
never believed in fasting.

515
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,130
They used to eat, gluttonous people, you see,
horrible!

516
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:32,930
They were living in tribes and very much eating,
all the time attention was on eating.

517
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,920
Djamel: It was not just that, You see all
men should not eat salt anywhere, You know

518
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,280
I mean –

519
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,320
Shri Mataji: That all will start there.

520
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,660
Djamel: And you mustn’t listen to anything
harsh from people

521
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,430
Shri Mataji: This was only for His disciples.

522
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,890
Djamel: He was trying too, Mother, and to
look at –

523
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,620
Shri Mataji: -women – adulterous eyes.

524
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
That they all do!

525
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,250
You see, at least He must have thought that,
“Give one month a trial, the whole year

526
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,250
you can’t do.

527
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,740
So, one month give a trial like that,” you
see so He said, “Alright, try for one month."

528
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:13,400
(laughing) But they can do fasting, is alright,
and then when did he say that, eat in the

529
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,480
morning and eat in the evening?

530
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,140
Djamel: Yes, it’s said that you must fast
from dark to –

531
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,720
Other yogi: Dawn to Dusk.

532
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,180
Djamel: Moonrise, I mean.

533
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,450
Shri Mataji: But they eat with vengeance at
both the times!

534
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,850
Djamel: But they do in the night, they eat…

535
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,390
Shri Mataji: …with vengeance, you see, so
everything is put upside down., Why He said

536
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,990
it because, you see, all these systems were
for his disciples.

537
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,610
They would do Namaz for five times, He thought
that He might be able to achieve the Realization

538
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,970
part of it, you see.

539
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,610
So He said, “All right, for one month, let’s
have a course like that."

540
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,060
See they went on a course, sort of thing,
“Let’s work it out."

541
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,910
And that thing has become a pattern now that
they fast.

542
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,460
It’s all nonsense, it’s madness.

543
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:12,240
Djamel: Mother I think it must be very good,
if someone is going to meditate, You know,

544
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,410
but for one whole month it’s a lot.

545
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:27,290
Shri Mataji: See, if they are paying attention
to their food only, waiting for the time to

546
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,300
come to drink it’s nonsense!

547
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,460
Djamel: That’s what they do.

548
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,840
Djamel: But people go extreme You see even
when they’re weak person.

549
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,970
A person should be able to stand it.

550
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,100
But they still do it.

551
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,080
And they end up in hospitals and when they
die they’re considered as martyrs.

552
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Shri Mataji: What do they say?

553
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,160
Djamel: You know it’s supposed to be very
good to die in Ramadan.

554
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
(laughter)

555
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Shri Mataji: Imagine.

556
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,170
Djamel: And if there is a war you must be
right in front line.

557
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,540
Shri Mataji: Yes, like in the war you are
dying.

558
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,650
That’s a war in a way, because you war against
your weaknesses, war against your habits and

559
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,120
things, it’s true, no doubt!

560
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,330
But that is a regular stuff, which one has
to do, but that’s not done, it’s something

561
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,330
very different, you know.

562
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,730
Djamel: Crazy people live today, You know.

563
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:22,441
Ray Harris: But You know, Mother, Jewish Rabbis
decide that it’s blasphemy today that you

564
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:23,690
are trying to achieve union with God.

565
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,690
Shri Mataji: Who says blasphemy?

566
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,690
Ray Harris: Jewish, a Jewish rabbi, Mother.

567
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,690
Shri Mataji: Is it?

568
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,240
Ray Harris: And it said in the paper that
we should only do His commandments, to become

569
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
part of God is blasphemy.

570
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Shri Mataji: Aah, this is…

571
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Ray Harris: That’s what he said, Mother.

572
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
So we never aspire to achieve part of God
that..

573
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,770
Shri Mataji: Because then his salary will
go away.

574
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,680
Ray Harris: Because it’s a silly eastern
religion.

575
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,130
Shri Mataji: Actually this is what happened
with somebody who had come there, he says

576
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,230
that, “I don’t believe in Shankara."

577
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,470
He’s a South Indian he said, “I don’t
believe in Shankara, because he believes in

578
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,920
Advaita,” – that is “Becoming one,”
you see.

579
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,710
Advaita – ‘Dvaita’ is two, ‘Adwaita’
means “not two”.

580
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,660
“I don’t believe in Shankara’s Advaita,
I believe in dvaita, I want to remain myself,

581
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,241
I do not want to get united with God, I want
to remain myself.

582
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:07,250
Why should -” I said “Which part of you
that doesn’t want to become with God?”,

583
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,250
He said “Not my ego,” I said, “How are
you sure?”

584
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,250
You see, this is the trick of the trade is.

585
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,250
That’s how they are going to continue.

586
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,250
That’s why they don’t want to be one with
God.

587
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,250
Because if they have to be one with God, then
these in-between religions will disappear,

588
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,250
isn’t it.

589
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,250
(laughter) The agency will be losing its powers!

590
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,250
End of tape

591
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,250
Reading of Devi Mahatmyam before Shri Mataji’s
talk on The meaning of Puja.

592
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,250
Brighton, UK – July 19, 1980

593
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,250
Shri Mataji:…You have to conquer this war,
how?

594
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,250
Because this is our war.

595
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,250
Loudly.

596
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,250
Very loud.

597
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,250
A Yogi reads from Chapter 3 & 4 of Devi Mahatmyam:

598
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,250
1-2.

599
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,250
“Then Ciksura, the great asura general,
seeing that army being slain (by the Devi),

600
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,250
advanced in anger to fight with Ambika.

601
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,250
That asura rained showers of arrows on the
Devi in the battle, even as a cloud (showers)

602
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,250
rains on the summit of Mount Meru.

603
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,250
Then the Devi, easily cutting asunder the
masses of his arrows, killed his horses and

604
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,250
their controller with Her arrows.

605
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,250
Forthwith She split his bow and lofty banner,
and with Her arrows pierced the body of that

606
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,250
(asura) whose bow had been cut.

607
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,250
His bow shattered, his chariot broken, his
horses killed and his charioteer slain, the

608
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,250
asura armed with sword and shield rushed at
the Devi.

609
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,250
Swiftly he smote the lion on the head with
his sharp-edged sword and struck the Devi

610
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,250
also on Her left arm.

611
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,250
Shri Mataji tells some people where to sit.

612
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,250
O king, his sword broke into pieces as it
touched Her arm.

613
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,250
Thereon his eyes turning red with anger, he
grasped his pike.

614
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,250
Then the great asura flung at Bhadrakali the
pike, blazing with lustre, as if he was hurling

615
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,250
the very sun from the skies.

616
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,250
Seeing that pike coming upon Her, the Devi
hurled Her pike, which shattered his pike

617
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,250
into a hundred fragments and shattered the
great asura himself.

618
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,250
Mahisasura”s very valiant general having
been killed, Camara, the afflictor of Devas,

619
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,250
mounted on an elephant, advanced.

620
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,250
He also hurled his spear at the Devi.

621
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,250
Ambika quickly assailed it with a whoop, made
it lustreless and fall to the ground.

622
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,250
Seeing his spear broken and fallen, Camara,
full of rage, flung a pike, and She split

623
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,250
that also with Her arrows.

624
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,250
Then the lion, leaping up and seating itself
at the centre of the elephant”s forehead,

625
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,250
engaged itself in a hand to hand fight with
that foe of the Devas.

626
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,250
Fighting, the two then came down to the earth
from the back of the elephant, and fought

627
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,250
very impetuously, dealing the most terrible
blows at each other.

628
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,250
Then the lion, springing up quickly to the
sky, and descending, severed Camara”s head

629
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,250
with a blow from its paw.

630
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,250
And Udagra was killed in the battle by the
Devi with stones, trees and the like, and

631
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,250
Karala also was stricken down by Her teeth
and fists and slaps.

632
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,250
Shri Mataji: …Devas, you see?

633
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,250
Even they are useless sometimes.

634
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,250
Enraged, the Devi ground Uddhata to powder
with the blows of Her club, and killed Baskala

635
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,250
with a dart and destroyed Tamara and Andhaka
with arrows.

636
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,250
The three-eyed Supreme Isvaari killed Ugrassya
and Ugravirya –

637
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Shri Mataji corrects: Ishvari said with stress
on the “Ish”, Ugrasya said with stress

638
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,250
on the “ya."

639
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,250
Yogi continues:

640
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,250
“…and Mahahanu also with Her trident.

641
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,250
With Her sword She struck down Bidaala”s
head from his body,

642
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,250
Shri Mataji corrects: Bidala stress on “Bi."

643
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,250
Yogi continues:

644
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,250
“…and dispatched both Durdhara and Durmukha
to the abode of Death with Her arrows.

645
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,250
As his army was thus being destroyed, Mahisasura
terrified the troops of the Devi with his

646
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,250
own buffalo form.

647
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,250
Some (he laid low) by a blow of his muzzle,
some by stamping with his hooves, some by

648
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,250
the lashes of his tail, and others by the
pokes of his horns.

649
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Some he laid low on the face of the earth
by his impetuous speed, some by his bellowing

650
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,250
and wheeling movement, and others by the blast
of his breath.

651
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,250
Having laid low Her army, Mahisasura rushed
to slay the lion of the Mahadevi.

652
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,250
This enraged Ambika.

653
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,250
Yogi realizes he has been leaving out the
middle “s” in “Mahisasura” but struggles

654
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,250
to get it right, Shri Mataji helps the yogi
to say “Mahishasura."

655
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,250
Mahisasura, great in valour, pounded the surface
of the earth with his hooves in rage, tossed

656
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,250
up the high mountains with his horns, and
bellowed terribly.

657
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,250
Crushed by the velocity of his wheeling, the
earth disintegrated, and lashed by his tail,

658
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,250
the sea overflowed all around.

659
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,250
Pierced by his swaying horns, the clouds went
into fragments.

660
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,250
Cast up by the blast of his breath, mountains
fell down from the sky in hundreds.

661
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,250
Seeing the great asura swollen with rage and
advancing towards Her, Chandika displayed

662
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,250
Her wrath in order to slay him.

663
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,250
She flung Her noose over him and bound the
great asura.

664
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,250
Thus bound in the great battle, he quitted
his buffalo form.

665
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,250
Then he became a lion suddenly.

666
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,250
While Ambika cut off the head (of his lion
form), he took the appearance of a man with

667
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,250
sword in hand.

668
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,250
Immediately then the Devi with Her arrows
chopped off the man together with his sword

669
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,250
and shield.

670
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,250
Then he became a big elephant.

671
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,250
(The elephant) tugged at Her great lion with
his trunk and roared loudly, but as he was

672
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,250
dragging, the Devi cut off his trunk with
Her sword.

673
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,250
The great asura then resumed his buffalo shape
and shook the three worlds with their movable

674
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,250
and immovable objects.

675
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,250
Enraged thereat, Chandika, the Mother of the
worlds, quaffed a divine drink again and again,

676
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,250
and laughed, Her eyes becoming red.

677
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,250
35, And the asura, also roared intoxicated
with his strength and valour, and hurled mountains

678
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,250
against Chandika with his horns.

679
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,250
And She with showers of arrows pulverized
(those mountains) hurled at Her, and spoke

680
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,250
to him in flurried words, the colour of Her
face accentuated with the intoxication of

681
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,250
the divine drink.

682
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,250
The Devi said:

683
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,250
37-38.

684
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,250
“Roar, roar, O fool, for a moment while
I drink this wine.

685
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,250
When you are slain by me, the Devas will soon
roar in this very place."

686
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,250
Shri Mataji: The wine doesn’t mean fermented
wine… today.

687
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,250
Ha.

688
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,250
Yogi continues:

689
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,250
“The Rishi said:

690
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,250
39-40.

691
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,250
Having exclaimed thus, She jumped and landed
herself on that great asura, pressed him on

692
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,250
the neck with Her foot and struck him with
Her spear.

693
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,250
And thereupon, caught up under Her foot.

694
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,250
Mahisasura half issued forth (in his real
form) from his own (buffalo) mouth, being

695
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,250
completely overcome by the valour of the Devi.

696
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,250
Fighting thus with his half-revealed form,
the great asura was laid by the Devi who struck

697
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,250
off his head with Her great sword.

698
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,250
Then, crying in consternation, the whole asura
army perished; and all the hosts of Devas

699
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,250
were in great exultation.

700
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,250
With the great sages of heaven, the Devas
praised the Devi.

701
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,250
The Gandharva chiefs sang and the bevies of
apsaras danced.

702
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,250
Here ends the third chapter called “The
Slaying of Mahisasura”

703
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,250
Shri Mataji: Read that little bit, when he’s
been slain verses.

704
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,250
He’s again born, you know that, everyone.

705
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,250
Yogi repeats the requested verses:

706
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,250
“The Devi said:

707
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,250
37-38.

708
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,250
“Roar, roar, O fool, for a moment while
I drink this wine.

709
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,250
When you are slain by me, the Devas will soon
roar in this very place."

710
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,250
The Rishi said:

711
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,250
39-40.

712
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,250
Having exclaimed thus, She jumped and landed
herself on that great asura, pressed him on

713
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,250
the neck with Her foot and struck him with
Her spear.

714
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,250
And thereupon, caught up under Her foot.

715
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,250
Mahisasura half issued forth (in his real
form) from his own (buffalo) mouth, being

716
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,250
completely overcome by the valour of the Devi.

717
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,250
Fighting thus with his half-revealed form,
the great asura was laid by the Devi who struck

718
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,250
off his head with Her great sword.

719
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,250
Then, crying in consternation, the whole asura
army perished; and all the hosts of Devas

720
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,250
were in great exultation.

721
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,250
With the great sages of heaven, the Devas
praised the Devi.

722
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,250
The Gandharva chiefs sang and the bevies of
apsaras danced.

723
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,250
Shri Mataji: Now the second part is the Devas
praise then the Devi.

724
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,250
That’s a very good one.

725
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
Read it also, Marcus.

726
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,250
“The Rishi said:

727
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,250
1-2.

728
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,250
When that most valiant but evil-natured Mahisasura
–

729
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,250
Shri Mataji: Rishi’s the, what you call,
Rishi’s the one who is relating the story.

730
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,250
Yogi continues:

731
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,250
“When that most valiant but evil-natured
Mahisasura and the army of that foe of the

732
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,250
Devas were destroyed by the Devi, Indra and
the hosts of Devas uttered words of praise,

733
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,250
their necks and shoulders reverently bent,
and their bodies rendered beautiful with horripilation

734
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,250
and exultation.

735
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,250
“To that Ambika who is worthy of worship
by all Devas

736
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,250
A child cries and Shri Mataji asks: Can you
take the child out a little for a while?

737
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,250
At the back, you see?

738
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,250
You can sit beyond Linda, would be good idea.

739
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,250
Alright?

740
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,250
When the thing will be over then you can bring
the baby in.

741
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,250
Ha.

742
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Hm.

743
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,250
Yogi continues:

744
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,250
“To that Ambika who is worthy of worship
by all Devas and sages and pervades this world

745
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,250
by Her power and who is the embodiment of
the entire powers of all the hosts of Devas,

746
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,250
we bow in devotion.

747
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,250
May She grant us auspicious things!

748
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,250
Shri Mataji: Did you hear that?

749
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,250
“Embodiment of all the powers."

750
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,250
Yogi continues:

751
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,250
“May Chandika, whose incomparable greatness
and power Bhagavan Vishnu, Brahma and Hara

752
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,250
are unable to describe, –

753
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,250
Shri Mataji: Hara is Shiva.

754
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,250
Yogi continues:

755
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,250
“…bestow Her mind on protecting the entire
world and on destroying the fear of evil.

756
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,250
“O Devi, we bow before You, who are yourself
good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous,

757
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,250
and ill-fortune in those of the vicious, intelligence
in the hearts of the learned, faith in the

758
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,250
hearts of the good, and modesty in the hearts
of the high-born.

759
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,250
May You protect the universe!

760
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,250
Shri Mataji: This is a prayer.

761
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,250
Yogi continues:

762
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,250
“O Devi, how can we describe Your inconceivable
form, or Your abundant surpassing valour that

763
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,250
destroys the asuras, or Your wonderful feats
displayed in battles among all the hosts of

764
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,250
gods, asuras and others?

765
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,250
“You are the origin of all the worlds!

766
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,250
Though You are possessed of the three gunas
You are not known to have any of their attendant

767
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,250
defects (like passion)!

768
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,250
You are incomprehensible even to Vishnu, Siva
and others!

769
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,250
You are the resort of all!

770
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,250
The entire world is composed of an infinitesimal
portion of yourself!

771
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,250
You are verily the supreme primordial Prakriti
untransformed.

772
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,250
“O Devi, You are Svaha at whose utterance
the whole assemblage of gods attain satisfaction

773
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,250
in all the sacrifices.

774
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,250
You are the Svadha which gives satisfaction
to the manes.

775
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,250
Therefore You are chanted (as Svaha and Svadha
in Sacrifices) by people.

776
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,250
“O Devi, You are Bhagavati, the supreme
Vidya which is the cause of liberation, and

777
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,250
great inconceivable penances (are the means
for your realization).

778
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,250
You (the supreme knowledge) are cultivated
by sages who desire liberation, whose senses

779
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,250
are well restrained, who are devoted to Reality,
and have shed all the blemishes.

780
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,250
Shri Mataji: See.

781
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,250
That’s why very few people stick on to Sahaj
Yoga.

782
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,250
The description of sages is clear-cut.

783
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,250
Again read it?

784
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,250
Yogi repeats and continues:

785
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,250
“O Devi, You are Bhagavati, the supreme
Vidya which is the cause of liberation, and

786
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,250
great inconceivable penances (are the means
for your realization).

You (the supreme knowledge) are cultivated
by sages who desire liberation, whose senses

789
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,250
Shri Mataji: “Senses are well restrained."

790
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,250
Yogi:

791
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,250
“…who are devoted to Reality,”

792
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,250
Shri Mataji: “Who are devoted to Reality."

Yogi:

00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,250
“…and have shed all the blemishes.

You are the repository of the very pure Ri…”

797
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Yogi gets tongue tied on the words “Rig-veda”.

798
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,250
Shri Mataji asks: You are what?

799
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,250
Yogi unsure: Rishis?

800
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,250
Shri Mataji: Rishis are the people who are
saints or sages.

801
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,250
Yogi:

802
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,250
“You are the repository of the very pure
Rishis.

Shri Mataji: All the sages, you see they are
repositories.

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,250
Is all the sages.

806
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,250
Yogi continues:

807
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,250
“…and Yajus hymns, and of Samans, the
recital of whose words is beautiful

808
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,250
Shri Mataji: These are Vedas.

809
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,250
Yogi continues:

810
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,250
“…with the Udgitha!

811
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,250
You are Bhagavati embodying the three Vedas.

812
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,250
And You are the sustenance whereby life is
maintained.

813
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,250
You are the supreme destroyer of the pain
of all the worlds.

814
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,250
“O Devi, You are the Intellect, by which
the essence of all the scriptures is comprehended.

815
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,250
You are Durga, the boat that takes men across
the difficult ocean of worldly existence,

816
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,250
devoid of attachments.

817
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,250
You are Shri Laksmi who has invariably taken
Her abode in the heart of Vishnu.

818
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,250
You are indeed Gauri who has established herself
with Siva.

819
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,250
“Gently smiling, pure, resembling the full
moon’s orb, beautiful like the splendour

820
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,250
of excellent gold was Your face!

821
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,250
Yet it was very strange that, being swayed
by anger, Mahisasura suddenly struck Your

822
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,250
face when he saw it.

823
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,250
“Far stranger is it that after seeing Your
wrathful face, O Devi, terrible with its frowns

824
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,250
and red in hue like the rising moon, that
Mahisasura did not forthwith give up his life!

825
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,250
For, who can live after beholding the enraged
Destroyer?

826
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,250
“O Devi, be propitious.

827
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,250
You are Supreme.

828
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,250
If enraged, You forthwith destroy the (asura)
families for the welfare (of the world).

829
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,250
This was known the very moment the extensive
forces of Mahisasura were brought to their

830
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,250
end.

831
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,250
“You who are always bounteous, those (fortunate
ones) with whom You are well pleased, are

832
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,250
indeed the object of esteem in the country,
theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and

833
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,250
their acts of righteousness perish not; they
are indeed blessed and possessed of devoted

834
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,250
children, servants and wives.

835
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,250
“By Your grace, O Devi, the blessed individual
does daily all righteous deeds with utmost

836
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,250
care and thereby attains to heaven.

837
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,250
Are You not, therefore O Devi, the bestower
of reward in all the three worlds?

838
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,250
“When called to mind in a difficult pass,
You remove fear for every person.

839
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,250
When called to mind by those in happiness,
You bestow a mind still further pious.

840
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,250
Which goddess but You, O Dispeller of poverty,
pain and fear, has an ever sympathetic heart

841
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,250
for helping everyone?

842
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,250
“The world attains happiness by the killing
of these (foes) and though these (asuras)

843
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,250
have committed sins enough to keep them long
in hell, let them reach heaven by meeting

844
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,250
death eventually at the battle (with me)-
thinking thus, that You, O Devi, certainly

845
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,250
destroy our enemies.

846
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,250
“Don’t” You reduce to ashes all asuras
by mere sight?

847
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,250
But You direct Your weapons against them so
that even the inimical ones, purified by the

848
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,250
missiles, may attain the higher worlds.

849
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,250
Such is Your most kindly intention towards
them.

850
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,250
“If the eyes of the asuras had not been
put out by the terrible flashes of the mass

851
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,250
of light issuing from Your sword or by the
copious lustre of Your spearpoint, it is because

852
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,250
they saw also Your face resembling the moon,
giving out (cool) rays.

853
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,250
“O Devi, Your nature is to subdue the conduct
of the wicked; this Your peerless beauty is

854
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,250
inconceivable for others; Your power destroys
those who have robbed the Devas of their prowess,

855
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,250
and You have thus manifested Your compassion
even towards the enemies.

856
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,250
“What is Your prowess to be compared to?

857
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,250
Where can one find this beauty (of Yours)
most charming, (yet) striking fear in enemies?

858
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,250
Compassion in heart and relentlessness in
battle are seen, O Devi, O Bestower of boons,

859
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,250
only in You in all the three worlds!

860
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,250
“Through the destruction of the enemies
all these three worlds have been saved by

861
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,250
You.

862
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,250
Having killed them in the battle-front, You
have led even those hosts of enemies to heaven,

863
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,250
and You have dispelled our fear of the frenzied
enemies of the Devas.

864
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,250
Salutation to You!

865
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,250
“O Devi, protect us with Your spear.

866
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,250
O Ambika, protect us with Your sword, protect
us by the sound of Your bell and by the twang

867
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,250
of Your bow-string.

868
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,250
“O Candika, guard us in the east, in the
west, in the north and in the south by the

869
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,250
brandishing of Your spear.

870
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,250
O Iswari!

871
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,250
“Protect us and the earth with those lovely
forms of Yours moving about in the three worlds,

872
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,250
as also with Your exceedingly terrible forms.

873
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,250
“O Ambika, protect us on every side with
Your sword, spear and club and whatever other

874
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,257
weapons Your sprite-like (soft) hand has touched."
