1
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:19,020
a month that I told

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,770
that you must have a puja arranged

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,160
the Sunday the full moon day and he

4
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,320
asked me what should I call is it a guru

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:48,809
puja or is it which are four Mahalakshmi

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:54,690
Ganesha's puja I told him call it a

7
00:00:48,809 --> 00:01:02,729
group tutor and he asked me later on

8
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:09,260
much later when I was going to India but

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:09,260
why not also have this pool over here

10
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,979
today is a very important day

11
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:36,520
because for a long time back when Christ

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,520
was just a child

13
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:52,570
we read from the scripture and declared

14
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:59,289
to the multitude that he was the Advent

15
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,289
the Incarnation he is the Saviour

16
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:17,190
they believe that a savior is going to

17
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:20,780
come today long time back on a Sunday he

18
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:26,420
says he declares that he was to say this

19
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,420
but why today is this Advent and a

20
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:46,720
he had to leave vanish for a very very

21
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:51,240
short time so at a very young age he had

22
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,880
to declare that he was the Adventist

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:03:03,930
that is remarkable to see that before

24
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,930
this no incarnation said publicly that

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,390
they were incarnation

26
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:21,069
ramaa of course had forgotten that she

27
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:23,980
was an incarnation in a way they were he

28
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:29,219
made himself to forget Kate is my upon

29
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,219
himself to become a complete human being

30
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:42,700
maria de buzos sama and shri krishna

31
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:49,049
also only told one person Arjuna just

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,049
before he was start what

33
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,299
if Dom never said that he was

34
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,959
incarnation though he was the

35
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,780
incarnation of primordial matter the

36
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,699
Tatra himself never said that he was

37
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:11,379
seeing causation of the bimodal master

38
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:15,669
with all these three forces acting

39
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:22,389
through innocence came on this earth to

40
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:28,889
guide Moses never said that no they knew

41
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:34,169
he was great he had overpowered nature

42
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,169
but he never said that he was being

43
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,040
at the time of Christ

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,090
one felt it was necessary to say

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:58,100
otherwise people won't understand if at

46
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,100
that time they had recognised Christ

47
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,440
they would having no problem

48
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:12,210
but still human beings had to evolved

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,720
further somebody had to cross the agya

50
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:22,440
chakra in the veritas to go through that

51
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:24,680
door that's why Christ came on this

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,680
earth

53
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:43,919
it is most surprising that in this tree

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:48,150
of life when the roots give out the

55
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:53,310
chute and the chute gives out the

56
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:59,370
branches and the branches give out the

57
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:08,159
leaves and the flowers also blossom out

58
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:12,300
of the same free those who know the

59
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:15,060
roots do not want to another shoot those

60
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,840
who know the chute do not want to

61
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,159
recognize the flowers this is typical

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,159
human nature

63
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:46,670
I never said about myself because it was

64
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:54,220
felt that shown beings have not achieved

65
00:06:46,670 --> 00:07:01,430
another dimension of evil even worse

66
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:04,750
than at the time of Christ may you blame

67
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,280
anything you can call it natural

68
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:12,650
revolution because you are away from the

69
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:17,120
nature whatever you may call it but

70
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:23,300
human beings had locked all contact with

71
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:28,520
reality they were identified with

72
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,070
artificial icky and to accept such a

73
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,190
great reality is going to meet him

74
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:41,630
possible for them that's why I never

75
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:48,760
said a word about myself till of course

76
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,760
some of the things told about me today

77
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:57,320
some of the possessed people also told

78
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:03,110
about me and also people started

79
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,740
wondering but how the most difficult

80
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,570
thing of Kundalini awakening takes place

81
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,570
with that speed in the presence of Mata

82
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:27,039
there was a temple in India and nobody

83
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:31,000
knew about it but they found that the

84
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:37,770
ships which went near a particular

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,770
spoils but we're drawn towards the shore

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,480
and it was difficult to fly them back

87
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:50,290
and there to put double forces to take

88
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:56,140
out of that attraction and they did not

89
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:59,290
know that there was some thing that was

90
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:10,110
acting they thought there was something

91
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:13,410
wrong with the depth of the sea but

92
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,540
invariably it happened to many ships

93
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,270
then they wanted to find out after all

94
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,459
what is happening to those ships while

95
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:26,680
all the ships suddenly start getting

96
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:30,190
attracted towards the shore so they

97
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,100
tried to find out and when they went

98
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:37,120
into the jungle they found a big temple

99
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:42,570
and on top of the temple was kept a huge

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,570
mass of magnet

101
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:56,250
so through rational understanding people

102
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,550
reach the point that Mataji has to be

103
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:04,120
something exceptional because nowhere in

104
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:08,130
the scripture written down anywhere that

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,130
such an incarnation came on this earth

106
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,360
whose we are ground even thought can

107
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,360
raise the Kundalini

108
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:31,130
many saints who are away from the

109
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:36,700
madding crowd sitting in the jungles on

110
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,700
the himalaya all know about it

111
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,430
because their awareness is at a point

112
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,430
where they understand

113
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,880
they understand much more than you do

114
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:07,600
because you are still children newly

115
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,600
born they are grown up

116
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:28,590
but today is the day I declare that I am

117
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,590
the one you have to save the demand

118
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:43,430
I think here I am the one who is

119
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:49,930
auditions we the mother of all the

120
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,930
mothers who is the primordial mother

121
00:11:49,990 --> 00:12:03,470
we Shakti the desire of God who has

122
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:06,070
incarnated on this earth to give meaning

123
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,070
to it sir

124
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:16,459
through this creation to human being and

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,880
I am sure through my love and patience

126
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,880
and my powers I am going to achieve it

127
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:47,160
I was the one who was born again and

128
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:56,150
again but now in my complete form and

129
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:56,150
complete power I have come on this earth

130
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:07,860
not only for salvation of humanity not

131
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:13,380
only for their emancipation but for

132
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:21,450
granting them between them of seven the

133
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:24,290
joy the Bliss that your father wants to

134
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,290
get to Apollo

135
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:48,590
these words are to be kept within the

136
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,100
bounds of sahaja Yogi's only for the

137
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,100
time being

138
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:12,260
and today is the day of guru puja not my

139
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:18,800
puja but your ku jazz blues I anoint all

140
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:23,600
of you as gurus and today I will tell

141
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,270
you what I have been told upon you and

142
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,270
what great powers you already have

143
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:52,900
among you there are people who are still

144
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:52,900
not being able to recognize

145
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:14,260
my announcement we'll work it out within

146
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:20,170
them recognition without recognition you

147
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:22,950
cannot see the play without saying you

148
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,110
cannot have confidence within yourself

149
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:30,010
without confidence you cannot become

150
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:34,180
guru without becoming guru you cannot

151
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:37,920
help others and without helping others

152
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:50,020
you are not going to be in any way happy

153
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:56,080
so to break the chain is very easy but

154
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:59,340
to build the chain one after another is

155
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,340
what you have to do

156
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,050
this is what you were all wanting to be

157
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:26,920
so be confident and be joyous and be

158
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:35,710
happy but all my powers will protect you

159
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:35,710
my love will nourish you

160
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:50,790
and my nature will fill you with peace

161
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,790
and joy

162
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,210
in God
