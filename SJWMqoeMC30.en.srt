00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,035
Yesterday one boy stood up and asked Me a question,

2
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:08,921
that "When we are such a yoga bhoomi,

3
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:11,462
we are such a holy country,

4
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:14,587
why is it that all the discoveries in the science

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,147
are made in the West?"

6
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:18,009
"Very good question," I said.

7
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:21,379
I said, "That is the knowledge of the tree,

8
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,712
as I have told you; that's the knowledge of the tree.

9
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,462
And what have they achieved is now the end of it,

10
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:29,587
and now they want to know the knowledge of the roots.

11
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:31,962
That's why they are here."

12
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:34,128
So to know the knowledge of the roots,

13
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,587
first of all we must have humility about it.

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,003
We have not known this knowledge yet,

15
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:42,837
never known what is in the Kingdom of God.

16
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,587
As Krishna has said, this tree grows downward

17
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:50,253
and the roots are in the brain - clearly.

18
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:53,837
So it is an ascent to go to the roots,

19
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,337
it's a different style.

20
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:58,462
Kundalini has to rise upward to go to the roots,

21
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:01,337
and to enter into the roots

22
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:07,420
what we have to do is to know about it.

23
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:10,337
Now all these things, like I said yesterday

24
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,545
that you put on bindi.

25
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:16,337
Now this is also - thank God,

26
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,128
despite all changes in the Bible,

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,462
it's written in the Bible

28
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,796
that you'll be known by the mark you'll be carrying.

29
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,128
Now let's see how many are courageous, even in India,

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,671
to carry this mark.

31
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,671
That's why you people catch so fast,

32
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,337
one of the reasons why you people catch.

33
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,671
First of all the eyes are not steady.

34
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,212
You are not used to the steady eyes, you see,

35
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,837
as the Indians have very steady eyes.

36
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,003
They are, from childhood they are taught,

37
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:39,921
"Where is your attention?"

38
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,921
All the time they are asked, "Where is your attention?"

39
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,212
There are some Western Sahaja yogis standing at the back.

40
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:49,128
Please give them a chair to sit,

41
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:52,921
since they are not able to sit on the ground.

42
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:55,629
So where is your attention?

43
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:59,170
Now the attention is so disturbed all the time

44
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,420
and that's why you catch very fast,

45
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,295
and when you catch from your eyes,

46
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,379
it goes through your Agnya Chakra.

47
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,961
Now this is the protection of Agnya Chakra;

48
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,879
it's actually the blood of Christ that you wear.

49
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,545
But people must have that courage.

50
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,754
They'll wear a cross, but not this.

51
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:17,295
In the Western countries it's very difficult

52
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:20,087
for people to have that much courage to put on this.

53
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:21,295
They will have excuses,

54
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:23,629
"Mother, we'll lose our jobs," this, that.

55
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,545
Every sort of an excuse is there.

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,796
But if you are courageous people,

57
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,504
then you have to start wearing it some time.

58
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:34,212
Maybe in the night you start first, then in the daytime.

59
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,879
Slowly, slowly you can creep into it.

60
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,879
That's the only thing I think you people have to wear

61
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,671
- that's important.

62
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,212
That will be a good idea, because you will not catch.

63
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,337
Because you go outside, your attention is outside,

64
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:49,337
you see what's happening outside, the atmosphere is bad.

65
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,796
Moreover, if you put this on it will not only protect you,

66
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,462
but also protect others.

67
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:57,879
They will have a new idea.

68
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,045
After all, you will dress up like them,

69
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:01,962
you are just like them - you have to be.

70
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,671
But you have to protect,

71
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,295
and for protection you have to wear something like that.

72
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,879
I found that when I went first to England

73
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,921
they used to laugh at Me, looking at My red mark.

74
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:14,045
I mean, if they wear lipsticks it's all right,

75
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,045
even if they are clowns, if they are hippies,

76
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,629
they are punks, it's all right;

77
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,420
but if you wear a proper thing which is scientific,

78
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:24,796
it's most scientific.

79
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,921
So to understand the science of the roots

80
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,337
you must understand what it means,

81
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,295
why this culture is like this:

82
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,545
because it is more towards the roots,

83
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:36,921
the movement is not towards the tree.

84
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,962
And the tree, where it has ended up?

85
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,462
Beyond the Mooladhara Chakra.

86
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,921
So now they are returning back.

87
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,587
To go from the leaf to the roots is very difficult,

88
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:49,962
but to go from the roots to the leaves is easier.

89
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,796
So for this ascent we have to be humble,

90
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:58,754
to know about the knowledge - knowledge about the roots.

91
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:03,170
Now why they put on, all of them, is this is the reason,

92
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,087
that to protect your Agnya. First of all there's no entry.

93
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:11,420
That's why, once an Indian gets realization, he ascends.

94
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,420
He doesn't go on catching again;

95
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,879
I mean, this doesn't happen here.

96
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:21,629
This is one of the things one has to do.

97
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,545
Now the second thing is the puja.

98
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,962
The puja has its effect on everyone,

99
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,545
but according to your depth;

100
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,420
and that's for that you have to have shraddha, faith.

101
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,504
If your mind is still thinking,

102
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,921
you cannot achieve much in puja.

103
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,212
While for Indians, to attend a puja is the highest.

104
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,545
They don't mind My lecture, anything;

105
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:44,045
if they miss the program, doesn't matter,

106
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:45,712
any music program is all right,

107
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,420
any kind of discomfort is all right

108
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,253
- as long as they can attend to puja.

109
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:51,879
Today people have come

110
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,420
from two hundred to three hundred miles for this puja,

111
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,629
all the way,

112
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:00,879
because they know this is the knowledge of the roots.

113
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,671
For that you have to do the puja.

114
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:04,671
If you have to ascend, you have to do it.

115
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:07,212
But you are still in the same level;

116
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:11,504
if you are still thinking about the tree style,

117
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:13,087
then you'll go downward.

118
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,045
To move inward, you have to have all these instruments.

119
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:19,629
One of them is of puja.

120
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,879
Now for puja, are we prepared?

121
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,504
Are we in that mind,

122
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:29,504
whatever time it has to start, will start?

123
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:32,212
First of all, we have tied our watches quite tight.

124
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,045
Thank God, I lost My watch last night!

125
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,212
So now the watches have tied us up so much

126
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,629
that now eleven o'clock puja means eleven o'clock.

127
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,045
It's not like that - it depends on.

128
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,796
It is the natural growth of our being,

129
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,671
it is the natural working of our growing.

130
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,545
When I came here, you'll be amazed,

131
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,671
all My right side was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed.

132
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,629
Right foot was paralyzed, I just couldn't move My legs,

133
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,671
and all the feet had become like a fossilized stuff,

134
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,045
and I didn't know what was happening.

135
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:21,045
The reason is, everybody has been thinking too much.

136
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,087
Now the attention should be how we are,

137
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,420
what are we doing about ourselves, that's very important;

138
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,045
how far we have achieved.

139
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:33,087
But on the contrary, the attention is disturbed

140
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:36,629
by many things. One of them may be the marriages,

141
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,796
that marriages have to take place,

142
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,671
what's going to happen and all that.

143
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:43,879
But at puja time it has no meaning.

144
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:47,961
Nothing has importance than but to develop yourself,

145
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,295
and this is what it is:

146
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,295
at this time you have to develop your roots.

147
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,962
And to develop your roots,

148
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:56,504
it's a different science altogether.

149
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:00,961
The another thing is that you can achieve

150
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,337
the movement of the tree by aggressiveness, by aggressing.

151
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,045
But when you aggress in the human mind,

152
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,545
then you are drawn towards the Mooladhara more,

153
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,629
towards the gravity force,

154
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,170
and you go down towards the dead;

155
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,420
the materialism starts coming up.

156
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:26,629
Because it's upside down, human growth is upside down.

157
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,796
You know the brain is here, not at the feet.

158
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:33,087
It starts from the brain, the growth starts from the brain;

159
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:35,961
as you know as doctors that the whole thing is here

160
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:39,962
and the nerves go down, they do not start from the feet.

161
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:43,504
So when you start putting your attention to your

162
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,962
outward growth, you go towards materialism automatically.

163
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,295
Then you find matter has nothing to do,

164
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,379
you have fossilized yourself. So then you come back.

165
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,379
Now you have to change your attitude completely

166
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,087
towards this new learning,

167
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,629
and this new learning is that you have to

168
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,879
develop a humble attitude, first of all.

169
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,962
And secondly, what are we going to achieve

170
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,754
in our ascent through learning the different tantra,

171
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:18,671
the mechanism, the divine mechanism - how to work it out.

172
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:23,754
The person who is extremely efficient in the other field

173
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,420
might become completely inefficient in this field,

174
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:32,379
absolutely useless: possessed, aggressive, good for nothing,

175
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:38,420
hot-tempered, hot-tempered, and also devoid of any love,

176
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,212
affection, compassion.

177
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,170
Like they were shocked to hear

178
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,629
that people kill their children in England,

179
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,962
they couldn't believe it.

180
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:48,962
They can't believe even one child killed like that.

181
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,337
They think that English are perfect people,

182
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,045
how can they kill their children?

183
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,962
They are very perfect according to Indians.

184
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:59,962
Indians have no idea as to what kind of life they lead there.

185
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:01,545
So when I told them,

186
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,962
"You are sadly mistaken, they are very unhappy people.

187
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,003
Don't think that by developing radios and all these things,

188
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:09,045
they are happy. They are all mad.

189
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,754
They sit before the television,

190
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:14,170
then they can't do without it, they become televisions.

191
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,045
And the television is exploiting them,

192
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:17,962
putting wrong ideas into their heads,

193
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:21,045
and they're brainwashed, they are very conditioned"

194
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,420
- they can't believe it.

195
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,961
They can't believe that people could be that cruel

196
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,961
in the West; because the growth is towards materialism,

197
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,879
so they are becoming gross, insensitive, immoral,

198
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,629
and also devoid of any compassion and love.

199
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,545
So first of all, as I said yesterday you should say,

200
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:44,961
"I'm not French" - you should say, "I am not a Westerner."

201
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,754
Let's see, that may work out, work out better,

202
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,295
"I'm not a Westerner." Maybe when you enter a university

203
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,087
- supposing you are in Oxford University

204
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,671
and then you go to the Cambridge University,

205
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,212
you have to wear the badge of the Cambridge University.

206
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:01,212
In the same way now you have changed your nationality,

207
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,961
I think you should say, "I'm not a Westerner now anymore."

208
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,420
Maybe the passport might say anything, doesn't matter.

209
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,961
But you have a special privilege in India as Sahaja yogis,

210
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,045
you know that. As Sahaja yogis the government

211
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:15,295
has accepted you. If you want to stay here forever,

212
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,170
they'll have no objection.

213
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:44,212
So this, whatever is now we think works out

214
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,212
on the tree level, has to be changed.

215
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,212
Here everything becomes united, synthesized.

216
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:55,045
The whole tree is synthesized in a seed.

217
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,962
So if you have to become the root,

218
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,087
you have to come down to the position where,

219
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,045
how to synthesize. Now grouping is a wrong thing.

220
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,879
If you group yourself as English, this, that,

221
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,045
or Indians or anything, is wrong.

222
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,671
In Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in all that.

223
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,420
There is no differentiation

224
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,087
between one Sahaja yogi and another Sahaja yogi,

225
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:17,754
because it is Vishwa Dharma.

226
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,420
But we say this is Vishwa Dharma,

227
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,961
but we are not out of it as yet,

228
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:27,837
we are not yet in the same pendal where we should be.

229
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,629
We still separate, we are still different,

230
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:34,629
we have to still mix up from one country to another country.

231
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,420
We have to all become one with each other,

232
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,962
understanding each other;

233
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:43,170
then only the problems of the West will go away.

234
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,545
As a result of this right-sided movement

235
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:49,671
I feel that people are really becoming idiotic.

236
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:54,087
I categorize them as idiotic or stupid, and all that.

237
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,504
I mean I don't how,

238
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,879
what categories they will fall into later on,

239
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,087
where there have been not such categories before.

240
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,045
I mean, they might form a new dimension of stupidity.

241
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:07,420
This is what I feel,

242
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:11,879
that unless and until you now learn about this new yantra,

243
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,170
the new method:

244
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,962
in that you don't see to the physical comfort,

245
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,837
you don't see to the so-called emotional pampering.

246
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,671
All these things you don't see,

247
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,545
but where do you go - into innocence.

248
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:28,629
The quality of the matter itself is innocence, the essence.

249
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,170
So the quality, I should say,

250
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,879
or the essence of everything you become.

251
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,087
You become the essence.

252
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,962
But for that you have to move inward,

253
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,379
and the inward movement is only possible

254
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,504
when you understand and respect,

255
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:48,379
and think yourself privileged to be able to do all this.

256
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,961
But you have to understand why I tell you.

257
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,962
I have nothing to gain out of you.

258
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:55,504
Now one should not think I'm trying to make you Indians,

259
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:59,420
but supposing you wear here three-piece suit and a tie,

260
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:00,671
what will happen to you?

261
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:04,045
I mean, you'll all get boils in the body.

262
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,170
According to the climate you have to change,

263
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,045
and you enjoy this dress very much

264
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,837
because it is very comfortable.

265
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,504
You enjoy the river baths, it's very comfortable.

266
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:15,837
In this country that suits you better.

267
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,170
So in the same way this new life that we are entering in,

268
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:23,253
we have to understand that the outside is not important

269
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,045
- the inside is important.

270
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,295
And for that whatever is to be done outside,

271
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,754
we have to do it, we have to do it.

272
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,504
We have to learn it, we have to understand it,

273
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,712
what is this, what is that.

274
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:37,504
Now because you are scientists, you are Westerners,

275
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,837
you have an advantage over Indians I should say,

276
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,629
or in science, all right.

277
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:44,754
In this science they have an advantage over you.

278
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,962
Doesn't matter, it's all right.

279
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,379
They chose this place to come in,

280
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,045
you chose that place to come in;

281
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,295
because you're brave people I think, first of all,

282
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:57,045
and secondly that you wanted to do some good there maybe.

283
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,712
But for that you must learn.

284
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:02,962
Like we say our scientists here are brave people

285
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:04,961
that they are trying to learn science,

286
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,879
they want to go abroad and learn about it

287
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,879
and bring some science to us.

288
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,837
In the same way now you are the ambassadors

289
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,128
from all these countries, of divinity,

290
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:18,128
ambassadors of divinity. You have to carry divinity,

291
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,379
because it has been worked out in this country.

292
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,045
As you can see clearly it is so, accept it;

293
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:26,253
there's nothing to feel bad about it.

294
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,545
Because you're attached to a certain nationality

295
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,879
and all that you think, there's nothing to feel bad.

296
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,420
In India people feel very proud

297
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:35,504
if they have to go abroad to learn science.

298
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:37,712
Even if they are vegetarians,

299
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,837
they don't mind doing biology dissection

300
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,754
or anything because it is science, it is knowledge.

301
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,587
So for knowledge's sake you have to do all these things.

302
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:47,754
And once you realize that for knowledge's sake

303
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:52,420
you are working it out, it's going to help you a lot.

304
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:57,379
This one, this today's puja, it has a special meaning

305
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,045
because yesterday was Datta Jayanti,

306
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:04,837
means the birth of Dattatreya.

307
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,170
And you know the story of Dattatreya,

308
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:10,045
most of you know the story of Dattatreya,

309
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,295
that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha tried to take a test

310
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:19,170
of Adi Shakti, called Anasuya.

311
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,420
They came to Her place and asked Her for alms.

312
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:28,379
And it's supposed to be a great privilege in India

313
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,754
to give alms to others,

314
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:35,754
to - I mean, it's a great privilege to attend to guests,

315
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,420
it's a great privilege to be generous,

316
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,879
it's a great privilege to distribute things to others.

317
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,045
It's a great privilege.

318
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:46,295
Like yesterday, you see, My sari for this puja

319
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:47,754
was left somewhere out.

320
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,962
So I had bought a sari for some lady here, so she said,

321
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,879
"I would like this sari to be presented at the puja."

322
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,295
But I said, "I'll return it you."

323
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,045
She said, "That's a greater privilege, too."

324
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:58,962
They didn't mind the sari was left out,

325
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,879
they said it's a greater privilege - the attitude.

326
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,587
So the attitude is to be changed,

327
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,170
that so far we are going downward,

328
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,253
now the attitude should be upward.

329
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,879
And for that, we have to understand

330
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,879
the method by which we are going to climb up.

331
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,587
Like you have to go to the mountains,

332
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:16,754
you must know how to do the mountaineering.

333
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:20,379
You cannot just state yourself, "Now I'm going to Himalayas"

334
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,629
- nobody will allow you.

335
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,420
So one has to qualify, and in qualifying

336
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:28,420
you have to have that humility, otherwise it won't work out.

337
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,587
So I have to make a very clear statement,

338
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,420
that you change your nationality

339
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:38,253
from the worldly nationality to the heavenly nationality.

340
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,003
And there, whatever is needed we'll be doing it,

341
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,879
we'll be accepting it, we'll be managing it.

342
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,003
For that you don't have to change anything like that,

343
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:53,295
but you have to transform yourself into a new personality;

344
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,879
new personality, where you are safe.

345
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:00,379
Now just see, putting on that, how much Agnya has come down

346
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,629
- just see.

347
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:05,504
My foot was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed when I walked in.

348
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:09,128
I couldn't walk. I didn't know how I was going to take bath.

349
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,420
I had to massage it, and then it came down.

350
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:16,128
So just see putting that, just see that, how powerful it is.

351
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:26,295
See - vibrations started flowing.

352
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:37,712
But people are somehow in the West very much frightened

353
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,504
that they will lose their nationality.

354
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:44,879
I mean, because - I feel, because the way they went all out

355
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,003
to destroy all the world and to destroy them,

356
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,712
and put their own nationality on others.

357
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:53,504
If you go to America - like yesterday I said,

358
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:56,003
"Thank God Columbus did not go to India,

359
00:17:56,295 --> 00:18:00,253
he went …" I said, "Thank God, Hanumana pushed him

360
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,587
on the other side.

361
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,003
Otherwise we all would have been finished here, this … "

362
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,045
You see, poor man, he didn't want to do all that,

363
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,295
but all those followed him just went and finished.

364
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,587
You can't find one aboriginal,

365
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:16,587
one person from those old Indians in Argentina.

366
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,379
I went to Argentina and they said,

367
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,128
"In the museum you can find them"- just imagine.

368
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Not only Argentina but also other places,

369
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,712
like I went to Chile: not a single person.

370
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:32,379
Only in Bolivia I found some of them, that's all.

371
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,420
But it is such a mixture there too,

372
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,504
because I think the people ran away to the hills

373
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,128
and managed themselves.

374
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:41,629
And whatever picture they have put about them,

375
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,170
as if they are the cruel.

376
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,587
Poor things, they have been all killed

377
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:48,961
absolutely by white men, no doubt about it.

378
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,128
It's horrible to go and kill others, go into their land,

379
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,879
occupy it because you have got machinery, everything,

380
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,003
you can kill all of them.

381
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,003
All this has been done.

382
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:03,045
Now we are entering into a new era where we have to love.

383
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:06,712
We don't have to aggress, we have to embrace.

384
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,879
This is another era altogether.

385
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:15,253
That aggression of Napoleon is over now.

386
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,961
It's a new thing we have started, into another world,

387
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,837
when we have to get more people,

388
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,295
we have to synthesize the whole thing.

389
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:27,170
And when you aggress, you start analyzing

390
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,253
- nothing to analyze.

391
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,754
Are you feeling better now?

392
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,961
Put on little bigger one.

393
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,045
See, you have a big forehead, then put on big,

394
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,504
the very big - why do you put the little, small one?

395
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,295
… on her head.

396
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:42,879
Fashion should not be done in these things.

397
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,462
There should be no fashioning

398
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:47,879
as far as your religious duties are concerned,

399
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,295
you should not. There is nothing like fashion.

400
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:57,587
Fashion is a human affair, it's not divine.

401
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,629
Look at these trees, how do they fashion themselves?

402
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:06,045
Towards the sun. Every leaf is exposed to the sun,

403
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,961
every leaf; because it has to get chlorophyll,

404
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:13,504
it has to get the power of the sun in itself,

405
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,128
so the every leaf is towards the sun.

406
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,462
They don't do any fashions, do they?

407
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:20,879
So another point is the individualism

408
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,961
that is started in the West is nonsense.

409
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,003
To show off that "I'm something different,"

410
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,504
you become stupid.

411
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,295
But to be one with everyone

412
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,170
is the real individualism, I think.

413
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,504
To be like everyone is the best.

414
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,837
It's very difficult, it's very difficult

415
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:45,961
to become one with everyone, because ego is so much.

416
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:48,504
Some people have ego which hurts others,

417
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:52,379
and some have whose ego is hurt - both just the same.

418
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,462
So to overcome all these things,

419
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,629
forget about that kind of attitude of descending downward.

420
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:01,128
But for the ascent whatever is required

421
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:05,253
is you look upward to God, look upward to Him

422
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,128
with complete faith - shraddha.

423
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:14,379
Then I don't have to touch you, you need not see Me.

424
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:19,712
It exists everywhere, you can get the blessings everywhere.

425
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,754
You don't have to do anything special for it

426
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,504
- just that shraddha.

427
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:27,337
But for that, certain mechanisms are to be put right,

428
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,921
specially the Agnya needs repairs, quite a lot.

429
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:35,837
That wheel is out of gear, and that must be put right.

430
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,879
Mr. Patankar was yesterday was rather angry

431
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,961
with the so-called educated people.

432
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,629
They are educated in English language, that's the problem,

433
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:45,837
the language is like that.

434
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,420
They think no end of themselves.

435
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:48,879
He said, "They didn't touch Your feet."

436
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:52,420
If they learn English language they will not touch My feet,

437
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,420
because in English language touching the feet

438
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,712
is regarded as something horrible, I think.

439
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,629
That's why he felt very sad about it.

440
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:05,170
But this is all architecture has come from England,

441
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,295
everything has come from Germany or from France.

442
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,712
Our telephones have come from France.

443
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:13,587
No wonder they work like this!

444
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,587
It's all the French who brought this,

445
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,587
and again they have got a big - I don't know,

446
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,712
if I meet Rajiv Gandhi I'll tell him

447
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:23,379
that at least don't give telephones to French.

448
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:29,045
They has given such a big, very big order to the French.

449
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:32,170
And now the helicopters they are buying from England,

450
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,379
thank God they've stopped it.

451
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,253
God knows what will happen to the helicopters,

452
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,504
coming down in India from England.

453
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:40,379
Like that you see they now are depending on the Third World

454
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,295
for their progress, because they don't know

455
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:43,837
where to send their own things

456
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,295
which are created by their machines.

457
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,961
But the way they do it: I mean, just imagine

458
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,879
the kind of phones we have here, all done by French,

459
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:53,629
not Indians. Why blame the Indians for that?

460
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,212
Is done by the French, horrid, they have been like this

461
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,712
since long, and they are just the same.

462
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,003
And again now we have given order to the French,

463
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:05,003
because we thought only French can cure

464
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:06,837
the French telephones.

465
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:08,587
I don't know what they are going to do

466
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,462
any justice to us or not.

467
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:14,712
So, as that machine is to be worked out,

468
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:17,504
our own machine is to be worked out;

469
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,961
and that machine is gone downward.

470
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:25,712
Let us raise it up, upward towards God in surrender,

471
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:30,128
in understanding, because you are specially chosen people

472
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:32,045
in that area.

473
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:35,212
Like the lotuses you have to come out of the mud,

474
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:38,712
and don't imbed yourself in the mud more and more.

475
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:41,128
Try to push yourself out of that,

476
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,712
so that the fragrance of divinity will spread in that mud,

477
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:49,128
and make the whole of that Western world a beautiful place,

478
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,587
beautiful place.

479
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:52,712
Whatever has been done is done.

480
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,212
I know one thing: without forgiveness,

481
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:58,003
nothing is going to work out. Done is done.

482
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:02,045
Erring is human, doesn't matter; whatever is done is done.

483
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,212
Whatever they have done is done.

484
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:05,921
It's all right, forgive them.

485
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,087
Forgiveness is the only way they can come up.

486
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:13,712
And when they are forgiven, they have to also realize now

487
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:16,128
that we have to rise;

488
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,379
because the world they have created

489
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:22,504
has really ruined themselves.

490
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,961
If they rise now the whole place can become fragrant,

491
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:30,337
as I told you, like the lotus that comes out of the mud.

492
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,212
It's a very wrong idea people have here about the West,

493
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:36,045
that you are the happiest people living around.

494
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:40,212
So it is better that we

495
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:46,003
tell them that "No, we are not happy there."

496
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:49,003
You, what you have got is something precious.

497
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,671
They also try to follow you,

498
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,003
and that following is going so far

499
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,961
that maybe one day you will have to come

500
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:57,045
and teach them Sahaja Yoga.

501
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,337
Because they are on the other side of the circle;

502
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:01,003
they are now trying to learn English,

503
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:04,003
master English language, and becoming sahibs.

504
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,671
They will come out with tailcoats,

505
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:09,003
and you'll have to tell them that better wear your dresses!

506
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:15,712
So we should be wise, we should be sensible,

507
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,796
and the stupidity and the silly temperament

508
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,921
that we have developed, we should give up.

509
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,961
Suddenly people bubble out, I see that.

510
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,212
You see, there's no balance.

511
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,587
The maturity shows when you have a balance.

512
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,003
You should be happy, I know;

513
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:32,462
but all the time smiling, putting up a show,

514
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,253
or sort of suddenly coming out with funny remarks

515
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:38,003
and silly remarks shows you are not matured enough.

516
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,212
You have to mature.

517
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:42,921
In Sahaja Yoga you mature, and if you do not mature

518
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:45,712
then Sahaja Yoga has done no good to you.

519
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,337
So you have to be very, very careful about that part.

520
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:54,087
I hope I've been able to tell you all about it.

521
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:55,504
Now what should I tell you ?

522
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,961
I was just praising you,

523
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,295
just praising you in front of others.

524
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,754
I tell them not to behave like stupid people,

525
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,128
and for you I must tell you

526
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:08,045
that you need not blindly imitate them.

527
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,462
Whatever we have got is a very great heritage.

528
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:13,170
It should be carefully maintained.

529
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,629
By looking at these people, if we try to imitate them

530
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,212
it will be a foolish behavior on our part.

531
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,879
Their life is not balanced but has gone to extremes.

532
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:26,879
I have stayed there for twelve years.

533
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,087
Thus I have spent a TUP (twelve years)

534
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,003
so I just wanted to tell you

535
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,337
that you should not blindly follow them.

536
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:38,337
Though old is gold, whatever is oldish  is not good.

537
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,379
So oldish is not good.

538
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:45,003
The concept of oldish has also come recently.

539
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,295
For example, from the Muslims we have learnt to harass the women,

540
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:50,921
from the English we have learnt to give dowry.

541
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:55,796
Now we have entered a new rules (of life)

542
00:26:55,962 --> 00:27:00,128
and in these new rules we need not give dowry

543
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,961
(to our daughters who are married).

544
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:03,462
The daughters have been given half the property.

545
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:04,796
This system is correct.

546
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,754
But here the daughters will not take, and neither give.

547
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:15,128
Thus we should not learn these things from them.

548
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:18,961
We should keep to our behavior of remaining humble,

549
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:21,087
to lead a balanced life as taught to us by our ancestors,

550
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:23,462
and discard whatever is oldish.

551
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,128
There are many oldish customs lingering in us.

552
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,045
For example, the domination of Brahmins in the temples

553
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,921
has to be given up.

554
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,504
They all have nicely fooled us.

555
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,754
Secondly, the custom of fasting  has to be given up.

556
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:34,712
I've told you hundred of times not to fast,

557
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,629
but eat whatever is needed for the body,

558
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:38,629
but people tell Me that "we cannot give up fasting."

559
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:40,420
But the worst oldish, very dirty habit we have acquired

560
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:41,754
is consuming tobacco.

561
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:43,671
We are not able to give up tobacco,

562
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,212
because we do not have enough strength .

563
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,462
Tobacco, mishri (chewing tobacco with lime),

564
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,212
who has brought these things to our country?

565
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,295
From where did the word "tobacco"  come?

566
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:55,545
There was no word for tambakou in Sanskrit language.

567
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:58,504
We did not cultivate tobacco earlier.

568
00:27:58,796 --> 00:27:59,961
It is the English who have brought it to our country.

569
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:05,212
The English have brought it here.

570
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,962
That's why we call it tambakou,

571
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,961
which has come from the word tobacco.

572
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:14,337
Where is the word tambakou in our Marathi language?

573
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,587
It has been brought here from outside.

574
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:22,587
Initially the Muslims cultivated it to some extent in our country,

575
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:25,003
but these people (English) have brought cigarette

576
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:27,253
and other things here on a large scale.

577
00:28:27,545 --> 00:28:29,754
They use it on a mass scale in their country.

578
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:34,420
They have also exported tobacco and ganja (sort of a drug) to China.

579
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,837
In our Marathi language I never heard of the word ganja

580
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,629
and charras (another sort of drug).

581
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:42,962
If you try to consume ganja  and charras

582
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,462
you will become like the English.

583
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:47,087
It's up to you to decide.

584
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,045
Thus whatever is given to us.

585
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:54,587
We never had tobacco in our country, you'll be surprised.

586
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:57,337
There's no word for tobacco in Sanskrit language.

587
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,379
This was brought partly, of course, partly I should say,

588
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,587
by the Muslims and then by the

589
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:08,671
- the smoking was taught to us only by English.

590
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:11,253
We didn't know that, what was smoking,

591
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:13,337
we never knew smoking business.

592
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,253
Muslims did have a little bit of it,

593
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,128
but that started quite late.

594
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:20,587
But actually this cigarette and this,

595
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:22,712
all this has started after the English came in,

596
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,712
"making it handy," you see.

597
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:26,379
They used to have hookahs.

598
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:28,796
That was rather difficult to make,

599
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:30,837
so they could do it only very little bit.

600
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:34,128
It was a long time back in the Islamic culture.

601
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:37,504
But the real, this cigarette business, this ego business

602
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:39,921
has come from the English, no doubt about it.

603
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,003
And the Portuguese, Portuguese and the French,

604
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:44,712
they taught us all these things.

605
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,253
So what I'm trying to tell them,

606
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:49,337
that whatever is oldish should be given up.

607
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:50,961
Whatever is old is gold,

608
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,754
but whatever is oldish that we call as junnat,

609
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,295
should be given up.

610
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:03,921
We have the custom of wearing saris with thick borders.

611
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,337
This is a very good custom.

612
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:07,796
Thick borders symbolizes maryadas,

613
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,420
and when we wear saris with thick borders

614
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:10,629
we stay in our maryadas.

615
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:13,212
Young girls can dress up whatever way they like,

616
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:15,003
but young women, specially married women,

617
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:16,712
should wear saris with thick borders.

618
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:19,212
If you give up wearing saris with thick borders

619
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:24,212
then you will lose all the art, all the art.

620
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:27,587
Weavers will lose all the art of weaving.

621
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,879
If we do not construct our houses as per the old style,

622
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:34,962
then we will lose all the ancient art of building beautiful houses.

623
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:39,921
These people like our houses built on the old style,

624
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,754
not the new style.

625
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,337
The reason is that the old style has got beauty in it,

626
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:49,003
and which might be lost if we built houses anyhow.

627
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:50,671
Even the earlier huts were much better.

628
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:53,962
Instead of this

629
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,879
occurring at a later stage,

630
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:57,545
once we lose all the art in the future it'll be too late.

631
00:30:57,837 --> 00:31:00,253
Thus whatever is our ancient art has to be preserved,

632
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:01,796
since it has beauty in it.

633
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:05,796
For example we have … type of saris which are called bugdya,

634
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:08,961
nowadays the women do not even know the names of these saris.

635
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,671
That's why we should always use the saris

636
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,837
which have been woven by us. They are good.

637
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:19,545
I think saris with thick borders suit better for the married women.

638
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,837
If the saris do not have thick borders, it does not suit them.

639
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,170
Married women should always wear saris with thick borders.

640
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,504
It is not an oldish custom, but is a very beautiful custom.

641
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:30,712
It looks nice, it matches with the women, it looks graceful,

642
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:34,128
it has got a look of a well-bred woman.

643
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:37,045
It is our culture, which we should not abandon

644
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,754
and become like them (English).

645
00:31:40,462 --> 00:31:41,921
We should not try to acquire their culture,

646
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:43,629
because our culture is very great.

647
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:45,379
If we pave our way by understanding

648
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,671
what has gone wrong with their culture,

649
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,837
then we can progress well.

650
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,671
We can accept their progress in science,

651
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:54,087
but in doing so if we lose our cultural heritage

652
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,629
then we will become like them.

653
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,671
They kill their children.

654
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,253
Husband and wife cannot stay together even for two years.

655
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,545
All of them stay in orphanages, waiting for death to come.

656
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:11,003
In our society we have to preserve our goodness and kindness.

657
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:13,754
Instead of that, we have acquired whatever is wrong with others.

658
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,504
First we had learnt from the Muslims,

659
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:17,170
and now we are learning from these people.

660
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,337
If we absorb the dirt from them,

661
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,712
how can our houses remain clean?

662
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:25,087
We were supposed to be clean and well-mannerly people,

663
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:26,295
and now we have acquired many wrong things from others.

664
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:28,337
Thus we have to abandon these things and cleanse ourselves.

665
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:35,253
Now, I've told them what is the importance of puja

666
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:36,796
but you know these things,

667
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:38,337
so I did not explain it to you.

668
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,754
But in puja one should have shraddha,

669
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,962
and we should not quarrel during the puja.

670
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,337
It does not matter who does the puja

671
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,253
since everyone is equally benefited from it,

672
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:49,921
depending upon the shraddha you have,

673
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,587
depending upon the shraddha you have.

674
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,933
Your pitchers will be filled up as much you have the shraddha.
