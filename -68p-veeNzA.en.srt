1
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:22,246
Today is a very great day for all the sahaja
yogis;

2
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:34,322
because Sahasrara opened in you, you could
feel the existence of God.

3
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:40,326
By saying there is God that was not
sufficient

4
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:48,808
and to say there is no God also was wrong,
very wrong

5
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:55,216
and people have suffered who have said
like them.

6
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,748
Only after getting realisation you know

7
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:07,883
that there is God and there are vibrations.

8
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:15,084
It's a very big opening all over the world.

9
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:22,133
Today I say that's why is one of
the greatest day for you.

10
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:38,760
Many of you have felt the cool breeze on
your hands and out of your brain.

11
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:44,968
Some have grown in Sahaja Yoga, some
have not.

12
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:57,728
Some are still carrying on with old
catches.

13
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:09,411
But now I have to say that quite a lot of
you can become gurus,

14
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:17,460
means teachers, and you should act as
teachers.

15
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:29,585
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja
Yoga, the theory and the practice of it,

16
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:36,690
thoroughly well and then you can become
a guru.

17
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:47,660
It's a very responsibility, lot of
understanding for a guru.

18
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,850
You should not have any ego, first;

19
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:03,531
you should not have any of your chakras
catching;

20
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,557
you should be absolutely clear all the time

21
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:15,412
and there the vibrations should be flowing
in both the hands.

22
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:21,650
If they are moving in one hand and not in
another you cannot become guru.

23
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:33,329
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi.
Then only you can be a guru,

24
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:39,335
and so many of you can be,

25
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:48,271
but you have to ascertain first: are you
capable of being a guru or not.

26
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:53,639
With humbleness you'll understand.

27
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,452
Those who think they can be guru should
become gurus

28
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:06,386
because now I can't travel from places
to places

29
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:14,540
and you have to do My job, is to give
realisation to people.

30
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,760
But you have be able to give en-masse
realisation,

31
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:25,466
then only you could be a guru.

32
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:34,696
If you can give en-masse realisation then
you could be a guru.

33
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:38,745
You can use My photograph

34
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:46,659
but the realisation should not be from
the photograph,

35
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:51,107
but from you.

36
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:57,722
Then only you can be a guru.

37
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:07,813
There can be ladies or men, both can become
gurus

38
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:12,312
and spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

39
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:20,198
In My whole touring business, Canada
I have missed

40
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:28,193
and I would request some of you to go to
Canada because it's a very beautiful place

41
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:33,138
and we have very beautiful Sahaja Yogis
there.

42
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:40,829
You have to do now My work. I won't be able
to go all over,

43
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:49,676
but you have to go to other countries and
create new Sahaja Yogis.

44
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,805
You can do it.

45
00:05:53,307 --> 00:06:00,062
To begin with you can use My photograph
but later on

46
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:12,899
you can only put the photograph there but
use your own powers and give realisation.

47
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:21,842
You can do it, and that is how we can
spread Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

48
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:30,529
I have done My level best now but I don't
think now I can travel any more,

49
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:40,862
so I'm telling you that you have to take
over and work it out.

50
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:46,957
That doesn't mean you cancel Me, no,
not at all.

51
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:55,086
I am there with you and every place you
work you put My photograph,

52
00:06:55,287 --> 00:07:04,535
but realisation you have to give and try
to give mass realisation.

53
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:12,908
If that doesn't work out then you should
know you are not a guru.

54
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,129
If you can give mass realisation, then only
you are a guru.

55
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,137
Otherwise you are not.

56
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:38,932
I said you can use My photograph but you
have to give realisation to people.

57
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,768
This is the sign of a guru.

58
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:55,008
Then you already know what are different
centres

59
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:03,637
and what are the things missing in people.
I've explained very clearly.

60
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:09,502
In the same way you'll find those who come
for realisation,

61
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:17,632
they'll have some defects and you'll find
out what chakras they are catching.

62
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:26,663
You know how to clear those chakras, so you
have to tell them how to clear.

63
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:34,399
Now you have mastered Sahaja Yoga so you
should know what is to be done.

64
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:42,752
If you think you have mastered, if you
believe that you have mastered,

65
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,609
then you can become gurus.

66
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:55,683
But first of all, you should ascertain and
find out for yourself

67
00:08:55,884 --> 00:09:00,139
if you are a guru or not.

68
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,650
It is your responsibility now to give
realisation to people

69
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:23,423
and you can give if you have vibrations
as like a guru.

70
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:35,823
Or ladies also, they're called as guruvi,
not as gurus, but as guruvis,

71
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:40,392
but they can be called as guru also.

72
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:46,411
And they can also do this work very well.

73
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:51,788
Solving the problems of people is not
difficult then.

74
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:59,546
Once they get realisation, their problems
will be solved.

75
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,369
This is a big power you have got, you all
should use.

76
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,027
First of all, you can use a group if you
want

77
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:17,947
and afterwards, you should do it
individually.

78
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:23,118
Can you imagine all of you, if you become
gurus,

79
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:28,637
how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over
the world?

80
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,351
Whatever you teach, you must practice.

81
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:45,370
When a person who drinks, cannot become
a guru.

82
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:53,478
A person who flirts and has a licentious
life, cannot become a guru.

83
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:01,073
So first examine yourself: are you clean
or not?

84
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:09,967
If there are many possessed people who try
to become gurus, they cannot.

85
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:17,658
Honestly you should see on the photograph
if you are possessed,

86
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:25,231
then you cannot be guru. So now to become
a guru is first to criticise yourself,

87
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:32,321
to find out yourself fully, and then you
can become a guru.

88
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:41,281
I don't want to tell anybody individually
but you all can find out.

89
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:46,720
Say four-five people can join together

90
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:55,457
and they can find out from each other if
they are all right or not,

91
00:11:55,658 --> 00:12:00,876
if there is missing, if they are catching.

92
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:07,137
But if they say there you are alright then
you can become gurus

93
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:15,926
and you can preach Sahaja Yoga. This is
your responsibility.

94
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:19,768
This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow.

95
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:29,350
Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't
go anywhere,

96
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:34,370
then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste.

97
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:44,975
So it is for you to carry the torch,
the light.

98
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:54,992
It's your responsibility now. You have got
your realisation.

99
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:02,159
I was born with the responsibility,

100
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:06,670
I was born with all the understanding.

101
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:13,338
And now you are also understanding
yourself.

102
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:21,447
Do not condemn yourself, as long as you
start your own realisation,

103
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:28,284
but be careful: don't become egoistical.

104
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:35,741
You have to be very humble, very humble
with everyone.

105
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:41,278
And work it out because if they are not
realised souls

106
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:49,050
you shouldn't condemn them but tell them
very patiently and sweetly

107
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:57,348
that "you are not alright". Tell them how
to meditate, how to improve.

108
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:02,267
It's now a very big responsibility.

109
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:13,592
Actually, I have done this work and you can
do this work also.

110
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:17,751
So you all have to become a guru.

111
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:27,774
This is the day of Guru Purnima and I bless
you that you all become gurus.

112
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:33,288
Whatever you have got now, don't waste it.

113
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:42,112
Don't throw away, but use it for
the betterment of people.

114
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:48,766
If you want, in the beginning, have four
to five people together.

115
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:54,597
Then you should separate. You have to give
time to this.

116
00:14:54,798 --> 00:15:02,632
You have got your realisation but you have
to give realisation

117
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:13,629
otherwise, your state is not alright, is
not normal.

118
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:24,433
So today I want to tell you what are
the qualities needed for a guru.

119
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:39,415
First of all, he should be a detached
person.

120
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:46,963
That doesn't mean you give up your family
or anything,

121
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:51,225
but you should have a detached attitude

122
00:15:51,426 --> 00:16:00,974
that anybody from your family does wrong,
you should go away from him or her.

123
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:12,120
Secondly, through your realisation you can
see that you can spread happiness

124
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:19,416
and remove their problems. You have seen
whatever I have done you can do it.

125
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:26,261
You have got power to do it but no
hypocrisy.

126
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:32,874
No hypocrisy, otherwise you'll spoil
the name of Sahaja Yoga.

127
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:41,510
So if you are sure about yourself then only
you should become gurus

128
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:45,757
and carry the work of Sahaja Yoga.

129
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:54,643
I think, I give you all My blessings and
all My support

130
00:16:54,844 --> 00:17:01,599
that now you take over and become gurus.

131
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:10,825
You can also have all the pujas and then
you can use photograph.

132
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:23,163
You have seen how one has to work it out
and if somebody has some defect

133
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:31,330
or some chakras are catching, then you
should tell that person how to correct it.

134
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:38,075
On the photograph it is the best. And very
humbly you should tell them

135
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:44,300
what is to be done and you can save all
the people.

136
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:52,801
So now I am no more available in the sense,
I've done My best

137
00:17:53,002 --> 00:18:02,486
and I think I won't be able to do this
again.

138
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:17,036
It is not My old age but I want to give you
a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:28,113
You have got it free and you also have to
give it to people free - not to charge them.

140
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:42,235
On puja days only, be careful that don't
put yourself on the puja.

141
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:47,847
Till you are confirmed and you are sure

142
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:55,697
that you have created at least hundred
Sahaja Yogis, good Sahaja Yogis.

143
00:18:55,898 --> 00:19:03,747
Then they can do your puja also. But
the best thing is to wait and see.

144
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:11,315
You don't end to puja business till you are -

145
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:23,485
you have done about thousand people each,
then you have the right to have a puja.

146
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:31,050
But you could have a puja with My
photograph till you are completely alright.

147
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:35,206
Now how confidence is the main thing.

148
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:41,563
Do not condemn yourself. You are all
realised souls,

149
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:49,781
but those who can think they can become
gurus, can become and try.

150
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:56,028
You have to have patience with the seekers.

151
00:19:56,229 --> 00:20:01,714
You can't be angry and hot-tempered.

152
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:13,379
Unless and until they try to trouble you,
you shouldn't lose your temper.

153
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,512
You should be quiet.

154
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:23,513
Most of the gurus are very hot-tempered
or have been before

155
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:26,799
and that's why they were busy with their
temper

156
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,258
and couldn't produce anything sensible, I
think. They could never give Realisation.

157
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:43,118
So, I have to warn you - control your
temper.

158
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:50,102
Watch yourself if you get angry, then you
cannot become a guru.

159
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:58,588
Guru has to be a loving person, very loving
and understanding.

160
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:10,048
Then you have to be humble, not to abuse
people, not to shout at people.

161
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:17,871
If they misbehave, you can ask them
to go out, but don't shout.

162
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:23,913
If you think somebody is misbehaving, you
can ask that person to get out,

163
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:29,451
but you need not shout or get angry with
that person.

164
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:37,333
So it's a very big responsibility now.
You've got your Realisation

165
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:45,055
and so four or five of you should join
to form a Sahaja Yoga group,

166
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:53,060
giving Realisation to people. Try.

167
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:59,823
Of course, My photograph will be there, but
still you must try.

168
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:06,100
Try to understand that now what is your
responsibility.

169
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,388
If a position is given, you have to always
carry on

170
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:25,088
with the responsibility of that position.
In the same way, if you become

171
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:33,264
a guru, you have a certain amount
of responsibility

172
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:41,738
that your own behaviour should be very good
to begin with.

173
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,645
In the beginning, you cannot tell them,
"Don't go to church,"

174
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:54,298
or "Don't do this, don't do that."

175
00:22:54,973 --> 00:23:01,444
You give them Realization and then you can
talk to them.

176
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:09,477
In the beginning, you shouldn't tell them
or they'll just shun you.

177
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:13,810
Accept them as they are.

178
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:19,564
In the beginning, you should not also cure
people if possible.

179
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,137
You can use My photograph to begin with,
but don't cure them.

180
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:37,135
Later on if you are confident, then four,
five together should treat that person.

181
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:49,891
Curing people is not very easy and you may
catch,

182
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:56,867
so before acting on them you must take
a bandhan. Bandhan is very good.

183
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:03,020
You should, even when you are going out,
you should take a bandhan.

184
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:14,115
You should also make a very good speech,
if possible.

185
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:20,165
Now you know so many things and you can
talk to them.

186
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:24,281
It's a very big responsibility.

187
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:30,177
Now I have been working from the year 1970

188
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:38,100
and today, so many years I have worked
so hard, but I can't now do it.

189
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:48,310
I have to go back and take some rest as
everybody has said, and you will also agree.

190
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:58,301
But you can tell about Me, if it is
necessary, but use My photograph.

191
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:04,757
Every time you have a meeting, use
My photograph.

192
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:13,336
Those who think they can be leaders and,
as gurus,

193
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:23,038
they should first see their own vibrations.
Meditate on My photograph and find out.

194
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:30,841
You have to be absolutely honest that you
are hundred percent all right

195
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:38,785
and there is no catch and then you can
become a guru.

196
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,937
You have to be.

197
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:52,559
First you may get two people, then three
people. I started with five.

198
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:59,323
So you can imagine how one can go with it.

199
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:07,737
Try first of all with two, three, five and
more.

200
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:15,371
You can also advertise afterwards, if you
have given Realization to people,

201
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:24,265
say about - you have given Realization
to ten people - you can start

202
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:35,450
your own organization, or whatever you may
call, and can work it out.

203
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:39,494
Now you have the power,

204
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:50,269
you have the right, but you must have
a temperament also.

205
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:57,010
In the beginning, you have to be very
patient and kind –

206
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:03,658
very kind.

207
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:10,335
Then gradually, you'll find that you can
cure people.

208
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,770
You can use My photograph for curing
to begin with

209
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:18,951
and later on you can see you can cure.

210
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:25,882
First of all, on vibrations you'll see what
chakras are catching,

211
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:30,028
which are good, which are bad.

212
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:36,016
And then you should correct them.

213
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:42,859
If there's something wrong, you must
correct it and then become guru.

214
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,449
It's not just accepting that “I am guru”
you become guru,

215
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:52,688
but you have to be very, very –

216
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:04,230
authority on yourself. You have to judge
yourself.

217
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:10,142
First of all, you should find out: can you
become gurus?

218
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,101
And then you can send Me your reports.

219
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:24,746
I'd be very happy to know how many you
have got now.

220
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:31,619
And that is how Sahaja Yoga would spread,
no doubt.

221
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,706
It is - it cannot remain at this stage
because I am withdrawing,

222
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:46,216
but because now you are so many Sahaja
Yogis, it will grow and work out.

223
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:53,698
But I think now I can't travel, and I am
going back.

224
00:28:53,899 --> 00:29:00,581
I won't be able to come back again –
not possible.

225
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:10,269
So you better work it out for yourself.

226
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:15,236
You must write to Me if you have any
difficulties,

227
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:21,996
if somebody is catching or something, or
you have problem.

228
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:27,784
Now I don't think any newspaper will
criticize you.

229
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:33,935
They have done it for Me, but not for you.

230
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:43,373
All of you promise Me that you'll try
to become gurus.

231
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:54,508
I didn't take any money from you, nothing
from you.

232
00:29:54,709 --> 00:30:00,761
I just want that you should spread Sahaja
Yoga.

233
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:10,416
In the beginning, even in the pujas, don't
take any presents or money.

234
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:14,281
You can only take little money from them

235
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:25,606
if you have need to have a hall or a big
place,

236
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:29,726
but that would be much later.

237
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:35,536
First of all, try with few people.

238
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:42,152
It will grow very well.

239
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:45,981
Now, the another thing is,

240
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:52,655
puja you should not allow them to do
to you, to begin with.

241
00:30:52,856 --> 00:31:02,716
Till you have done three hundred Sahaja
Yogis, you can't ask them to do you puja.

242
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:09,582
You can use My photograph for the puja,
to begin with,

243
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:16,421
but be very careful because you have powers
now

244
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:27,141
and it might pamper your ego, maybe you
start thinking you are great – no.

245
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:34,173
You have to save the world. All My work is
that,

246
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:44,296
and I would ask you to write to Me in India
if there is any difficulty.

247
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:49,187
Also write to Me how you are spreading
Sahaja Yoga,

248
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:53,702
what is happening, I would like to know.

249
00:31:54,734 --> 00:32:03,645
But I think you will understand that I must
retire now. I can't travel.

250
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,952
If you have any questions, ask Me.

251
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:31,024
Those who are confident that they can
become gurus, raise your hands.

252
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:38,132
Oh, so many.

253
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:46,986
Only one hand, not two.

254
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:59,853
If anybody is making money, you should tell
him not to do it

255
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:08,524
and also write to Me. You cannot make
money, to begin with,

256
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:15,435
but when you have about three thousand
people,

257
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:26,059
you can celebrate all the worshipping days
and worship.

258
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,510
But you must make at least three thousand
disciples, each.

259
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:39,443
Then you can ask for a puja.

260
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:53,245
There are some people who cannot become
gurus,

261
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:58,751
who are catching and they have problems.

262
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:04,901
If you have problems, don't become guru,
otherwise, it will affect you.

263
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:13,684
But if you think you are clear and opened
out, then you can become gurus.

264
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:20,756
Is there any question?

265
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:48,346
I am opening a centre for international
Sahaja Yoga

266
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:53,118
and when you have done with three hundred
Sahaja Yogis,

267
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:58,638
you can ask them to do puja and take money.

268
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:05,847
Before that, if you get any money, you can
send it to that centre.

269
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:15,207
There would be about eleven members in that
centre and I'll declare it.

270
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:19,888
If you have any questions, ask Me now.

271
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:34,998
First three hundred people you don't take
any money,

272
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:44,028
except for the hall or except for other
expenses.

273
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:51,216
But you don't take any money for yourself.

274
00:35:54,917 --> 00:36:01,197
Now, can you raise again your hands how
many would like to be gurus?

275
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,253
May God bless you.

276
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,879
Do you have any questions?

277
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:46,380
You can take money on organization basis,

278
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:52,709
that you have to have a hall, loudspeaker,
and all those things.

279
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,716
But you shouldn't take it for your
individual use.

280
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:04,783
You should be very careful till you have
three hundred Sahaja Yogis.

281
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:14,389
You can form a group of five to ten people
and start your work.

282
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,619
You'll enjoy it.

283
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,534
Anyone has any problem, ask Me.

284
00:37:54,565 --> 00:38:01,700
I have to go to Canada - I have not been,
but I'll try to find some time.

285
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:09,751
First now I have to go to Russia, and then
I can go to Canada.

286
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:20,600
You have to work more in your country than
outside, to begin with,

287
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:26,672
and then you can spread it all over.

288
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:35,883
Again let us see how many want to be gurus?

289
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:41,740
Oh! What a big number.

290
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:47,111
Thank you very much, thank you, thank
you all.

291
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,531
Yogi: Should we do the Aarti?
Shri Mataji: Yes, you may do, it went well.

292
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,373
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: From where are they all?

293
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,057
Yogi: Are we permitted to do Aarti? Aarti?
Shri Mataji: We should go…

294
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:41,470
Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: Do Aarti.
