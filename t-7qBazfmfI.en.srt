1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:10,587
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

2
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:15,213
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

3
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:21,171
For example, today is Wednesday

4
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,587
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

5
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:28,129
because I was born on Wednesday.

6
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,962
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

7
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,046
we’ll be able to manage it

8
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,088
because I was born at twelve.

9
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:40,587
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

10
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:46,004
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,587
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

12
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,796
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

13
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:57,754
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

14
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,004
that you all are ready for a Puja

15
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:05,712
and that we could break this rule also,

16
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,088
after such a long time,

17
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:15,587
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

18
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,171
I was trying, trying, trying

19
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:20,629
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

20
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:31,587
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

21
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:38,004
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

22
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:44,921
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

23
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,587
and I don’t know how far

24
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:52,587
I can go with the description of this great country

25
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,962
which we call as Greece.

26
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:06,129
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

27
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:11,962
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

28
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,046
and a “dweep” is a island.

29
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:20,004
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

30
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:25,046
and there is a temple of Athena,

31
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:31,921
all been described about Her temple, about Her

32
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:37,837
jewelry, dress and everything.

33
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,670
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

34
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:46,837
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

35
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:51,046
So now, one may say that,

36
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,296
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

37
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:56,587
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

38
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,587
One may ask a question like that,

39
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:06,587
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

40
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:13,587
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

41
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:21,004
before the Creation was created in the material form,

42
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:24,962
where it was planned,

43
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:31,171
then there was something of the –

44
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,587
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

45
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:43,088
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

46
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:50,004
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

47
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:59,670
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

48
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:05,921
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

49
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,962
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

50
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,254
and create vibrations there.

51
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:16,254
Now in the material form the Gokul was

52
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,879
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

53
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:28,796
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

54
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:35,629
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

55
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,296
in this area, to create the vibrations.

56
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,213
So it is not only She was a Goddess

57
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,171
but She lived in this area

58
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,587
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

59
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:57,171
to create the universal

60
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,129
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

61
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:10,171
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

62
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:19,046
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

63
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,587
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

64
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:29,213
and the Mahalakshmi has got

65
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:32,587
for the redemption, for the awakening.

66
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:37,837
But the Adi Shakti’s work

67
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,837
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

68
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,296
and to integrate all those qualities,

69
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:51,587
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

70
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:56,213
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

71
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:59,796
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

72
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:02,587
But as it is,

73
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,837
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

74
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:08,837
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

75
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,879
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

76
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:14,921
And this is the…

77
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,171
where She created the Devaloka.

78
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:22,587
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

79
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,587
Like She created Indra –

80
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,962
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

81
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:33,962
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

82
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,587
Devaloka was created on this side,

83
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:42,796
and ganas and all these people were created

84
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:47,254
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

85
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:57,587
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

86
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:04,004
in such a condition when people were really,

87
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:07,837
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

88
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,837
they could not understand Him,

89
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,879
they could not understand Socrates at all

90
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,046
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

91
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:22,046
by the people who were surrounding Him,

92
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:26,837
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

93
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:30,088
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

94
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:34,587
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

95
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:40,171
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

96
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,587
and they started their own theories, own styles,

97
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,587
and that’s how we find the accent from

98
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:50,587
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

99
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:55,921
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

100
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,921
So the attention was moved from philosophy

101
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,962
to economics today,

102
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:08,213
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

103
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,962
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

104
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:20,837
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

105
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,879
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

106
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:32,921
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

107
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,587
Abraham had different problems.

108
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:39,670
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

109
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,171
who were  really very, very ignorant,

110
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:47,004
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

111
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:51,796
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

112
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,587
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

113
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:56,296
and if you read Bible, in the –

114
00:08:56,587 --> 00:09:01,004
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

115
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:09,004
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

116
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:13,754
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

117
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,879
to make the people follow religion precisely.

118
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:22,213
So He did not argue, He did not say

119
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,962
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

120
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,088
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

121
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:32,712
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

122
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:39,254
that you understand this or

123
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:42,213
that you see the point;

124
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,004
He could not do that way.

125
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:48,213
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

126
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,796
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

127
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:54,796
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

128
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,004
Because the people were of that type.

129
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:02,670
Now then you see how gradually,

130
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:06,670
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

131
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,754
they were a much better people

132
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,879
so He could talk to them about something

133
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:19,837
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

134
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,837
Of so many things He talked,

135
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:25,004
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

136
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:29,587
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

137
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,587
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

138
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:37,213
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

139
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:42,171
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

140
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:46,962
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

141
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:51,129
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

142
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:56,254
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

143
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,712
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

144
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,213
and the relationships were building up,

145
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:06,754
and He tried to work it on that level.

146
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,879
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

147
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:16,587
They evolved but still very ignorant.

148
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,046
So they evolved to this point

149
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,962
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

150
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:28,171
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

151
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,921
taking their freedom, getting out from there

152
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:39,587
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

153
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,129
But when they did that,

154
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:46,171
He found these people on the way –

155
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,921
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

156
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,962
when He came back – what He finds…

157
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:21,213
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

158
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:26,921
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

159
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:32,004
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

160
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,004
extremely immoral character.

161
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:40,587
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

162
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,921
that nobody can believe that anybody

163
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:46,754
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

164
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,962
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

165
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:55,213
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

166
00:12:55,796 --> 00:13:03,796
Now then came the time when people were…

167
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,587
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

168
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,712
we can say at the time of Christ,

169
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:16,046
but they were not so immoral;

170
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,213
they also could not understand Christ.

171
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:25,004
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

172
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,587
the human awareness evolving,

173
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:33,796
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

174
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:37,254
and you could not talk to them.

175
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:43,004
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

176
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:46,213
When the circumstances are such,

177
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:50,587
like at the time of, say Moses,

178
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,129
that people are extremely immoral,

179
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,129
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

180
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:03,046
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

181
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:09,712
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

182
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,587
because they were so left-sided:

183
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:17,796
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

184
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:21,587
and say that, “If you do like this,

185
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:24,587
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

186
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,962
So they took to violence.

187
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:34,587
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

188
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,629
also the awareness of human beings.

189
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,754
So many things worked it out.

190
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:47,712
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

191
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:56,754
her job was to create a integrated force

192
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:07,837
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

193
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:16,171
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

194
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:24,629
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

195
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,879
You have to integrate people

196
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:36,712
which are left-sided and right-sided.

197
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,587
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

198
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,587
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

199
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,712
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

200
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:57,587
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

201
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:04,879
and despite that they resisted him

202
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,879
because they were given this special capacity.

203
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:12,088
Something with Greeks, they went to…

204
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,088
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

205
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:20,921
who tried to invade India,

206
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,796
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

207
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,254
You see it’s a Greek nature

208
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,962
that they can go so far and then not,

209
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,962
because they have an integrating force.

210
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:40,213
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

211
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:45,754
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

212
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:50,046
So this power of receding back

213
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,587
is the integrating power,

214
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:57,712
by you integrate within yourself

215
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:02,712
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

216
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,088
and you see now that’s alright.

217
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,088
If you have to be in the centre

218
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,129
we should go up to a point and come back.

219
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:17,004
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

220
00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:19,587
If you take their shipping,

221
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:23,088
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

222
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,296
extremely aggressive people,

223
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,296
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

224
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,587
They were not very law-abiding

225
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,171
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

226
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:39,046
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

227
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:44,712
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

228
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:49,754
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

229
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:55,088
So perhaps, perhaps,

230
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:59,088
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

231
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,296
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

232
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:06,670
Then when the shipping went down –

233
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,171
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

234
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,587
they sunk their ships

235
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:18,088
and got the money out of insurance.

236
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:28,587
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

237
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,837
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

238
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,629
they know that how far to go.

239
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:40,254
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

240
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,712
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

241
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:47,754
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

242
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,213
Alright. He married her up to a point,

243
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:54,670
but most of his property went to his daughter,

244
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,670
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

245
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:04,171
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

246
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:07,879
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

247
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,796
like Americans are.

248
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:13,004
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

249
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:15,129
but Greeks can never become idiots,

250
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,171
whatever you may try.

251
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:21,213
They are very sharp and very intelligent

252
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,088
but they know how far to go with everything.

253
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:29,129
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

254
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:34,046
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

255
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:37,046
and She created Ganesha here.

256
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:41,171
And the balance of the universe,

257
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:45,004
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

258
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:49,629
and so the people over here are very balanced.

259
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:55,796
You can find them very…

260
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,796
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

261
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:04,088
One may say because they are traditional people,

262
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,129
they have long traditions.

263
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:09,587
But Egypt had also long traditions.

264
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,088
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

265
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,004
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

266
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:22,254
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

267
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,837
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

268
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:33,587
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

269
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,921
but they are not like Indians.

270
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:42,879
So what is lacking in all these people is

271
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:47,879
the depth of awareness

272
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:54,962
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

273
00:20:55,254 --> 00:21:02,213
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

274
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:08,962
and China rose also, afterwards,

275
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:12,088
into her own glory

276
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:18,129
and became quite a good industrial,

277
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:22,004
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

278
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:28,879
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

279
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,629
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

280
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:33,921
Do you know last…

281
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,879
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

282
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,837
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

283
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,670
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

284
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:50,670
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

285
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:54,129
and you see what’s happening in China.

286
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:59,004
So the effects of these

287
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:08,171
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

288
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:12,879
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

289
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,754
Now you may say that,

290
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:19,796
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

291
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:26,629
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

292
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,046
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

293
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,796
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

294
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,962
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

295
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:41,921
so I thought that let Greeks

296
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:46,754
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

297
00:22:47,837 --> 00:22:51,213
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

298
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:57,629
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

299
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:04,796
because actually, at the time

300
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:07,004
when Athena came here,

301
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:11,171
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

302
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:17,171
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

303
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,213
So now to bring Himalaya here,

304
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:25,587
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

305
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,213
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

306
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:33,171
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

307
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:40,587
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

308
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,796
most unorthodox,

309
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:47,254
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

310
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:54,587
So we have a problem, big problem,

311
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:58,171
how we’ll establish here.

312
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:04,837
The Devaloka was formed here

313
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:09,004
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

314
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:14,004
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

315
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:20,004
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

316
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:27,088
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

317
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:34,754
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

318
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:41,921
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

319
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:47,837
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

320
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:51,088
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

321
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:55,129
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

322
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,670
And that is responsible for the downfall

323
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:03,754
because this part of the country

324
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,921
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

325
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:19,088
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

326
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:25,796
we see it has become just the opposite

327
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:33,962
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

328
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,962
to such degrading things.

329
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:44,046
Even in the mythology also, in India

330
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:50,129
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

331
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:56,796
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

332
00:25:57,587 --> 00:26:05,712
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

333
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:13,962
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

334
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:19,629
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

335
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:24,921
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

336
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:30,088
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

337
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:35,046
and from here Indra went down

338
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:39,088
and took away the wife.

339
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:44,088
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

340
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:48,046
and Indra went down,

341
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:52,088
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

342
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:56,088
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

343
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:01,004
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

344
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:05,712
So now the… see how the combinations are,

345
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:13,088
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

346
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:16,088
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

347
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:20,629
it was in his ashram He stayed.

348
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:25,296
So the Muni Shandilya told

349
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:29,587
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

350
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:35,088
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

351
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:42,629
who will, by his own devotion,

352
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:47,088
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

353
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:54,213
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

354
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,171
and He will kill this asura.

355
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,670
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

356
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,670
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

357
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,213
So this Narasimha came

358
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:17,088
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

359
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,962
little boy played there around and he made some

360
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:26,046
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

361
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:31,171
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

362
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,629
That was made by Prahlad,

363
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,129
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

364
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:40,629
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

365
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:44,587
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

366
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,796
So see the relationship, how it is.

367
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:53,046
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

368
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:01,088
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

369
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:08,754
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

370
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:15,213
that not any animal can kill him,

371
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,921
not any human being can kill him,

372
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:21,921
not on the land or in the sky,

373
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,587
and not with any weapon –

374
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:28,587
all so many blessings he had taken!

375
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:31,296
He had closed all the lines, you see,

376
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,670
so that nobody should kill him,

377
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:40,129
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

378
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:45,254
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

379
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:49,254
is that He became the simha,

380
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:54,837
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

381
00:29:56,004 --> 00:30:01,254
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

382
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,796
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

383
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:08,796
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

384
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:11,921
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

385
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:15,712
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

386
00:30:15,837 --> 00:30:19,004
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

387
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:21,004
pillar of stone,

388
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:25,171
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

389
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:31,046
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

390
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:34,046
with long hands and claws,

391
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:36,837
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

392
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:42,254
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

393
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:47,587
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

394
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:49,962
He opened his stomach and killed him.

395
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:55,088
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

396
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:59,754
the people of Egypt made their…

397
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:03,171
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

398
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:07,171
they were the ones who were asuras,

399
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,837
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

400
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:16,587
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

401
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:20,254
the other way round than Narasimha.

402
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:28,213
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

403
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:35,254
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

404
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:39,879
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

405
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:48,004
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

406
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:51,046
because all these devas were Greeks –

407
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:54,754
and these devas were, like Indra,

408
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:57,754
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

409
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:01,921
But I think there… because

410
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:05,796
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

411
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:12,213
they could not see the proper image of their...

412
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:19,213
of their...faces in their meditation

413
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,629
because they perverted them

414
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,629
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

415
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,796
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

416
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:31,587
which was all their own imagination

417
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:35,712
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

418
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:41,796
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

419
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:49,171
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

420
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:51,837
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

421
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:55,171
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

422
00:32:55,213 --> 00:33:00,254
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

423
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:04,254
So they made them more like…

424
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,962
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

425
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,879
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

426
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:15,088
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

427
00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:17,587
like Varuna, I can tell you.

428
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:20,754
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

429
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:23,254
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

430
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:28,754
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

431
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,796
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

432
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:34,921
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

433
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:40,796
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

434
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:47,629
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

435
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:50,213
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

436
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:51,921
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

437
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:55,712
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

438
00:33:57,587 --> 00:33:59,837
So with such expense they gave it

439
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:03,712
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

440
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,712
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

441
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:14,296
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

442
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:22,796
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

443
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:27,296
On that history stands the modern Greek.

444
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:34,088
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

445
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,962
people had evolved we think,

446
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:40,587
but they also crucified Christ,

447
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,670
so what was their evolution?

448
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:50,712
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

449
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:56,046
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

450
00:34:57,587 --> 00:34:59,171
there is much difference

451
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:04,962
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

452
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:09,796
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

453
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:12,921
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

454
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:17,004
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

455
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:20,587
But still He was also killed;

456
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:24,962
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

457
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:29,629
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

458
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:33,837
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

459
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:40,088
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

460
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,213
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

461
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:50,670
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

462
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:55,088
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

463
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,712
500 before Christ;

464
00:35:57,004 --> 00:36:02,921
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

465
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:06,754
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

466
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:10,046
as because He was Primordial Master.

467
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,921
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

468
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,088
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

469
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:25,296
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

470
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:30,088
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

471
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:34,046
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

472
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:38,962
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

473
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:42,962
they would not accept any person,

474
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:45,879
they would throw away, they would beat people.

475
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:50,046
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

476
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:52,796
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

477
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,712
like very harsh people.

478
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:59,254
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

479
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:02,587
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

480
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,879
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

481
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:08,171
See, He saw the point

482
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:12,213
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

483
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:14,629
talking in that way.

484
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,796
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

485
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:20,129
even reason it out like Socrates did,

486
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:23,921
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

487
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:27,046
the whole logic system comes from Him,

488
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,879
He’s a master of logic.

489
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:35,587
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

490
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:39,754
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

491
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:44,254
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

492
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:48,587
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

493
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:52,004
And Christ understood that there is no logic

494
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:55,213
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

495
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:58,629
So He talked to them in parables,

496
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:01,254
but still they killed Him.

497
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:07,046
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

498
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:11,254
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

499
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:14,879
were very funny, and they did it.

500
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:22,171
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

501
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:26,129
I should give Realisation to people first,

502
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:31,296
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

503
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:34,587
Now, I’m talking to you everything

504
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:37,670
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

505
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,670
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

506
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:45,754
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

507
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:47,962
and one who are not.

508
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:52,046
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

509
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:56,587
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

510
00:38:56,712 --> 00:39:02,921
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

511
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:06,921
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

512
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:10,921
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

513
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:14,587
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

514
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:19,129
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

515
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:24,004
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

516
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:27,088
where collectively you are understanding Me.

517
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:30,171
The situation is not so bad as that was

518
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:33,004
even at the time of Christ.

519
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,129
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

520
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:38,129
He was the only wise man going around.

521
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,088
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

522
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:44,129
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

523
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:48,088
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

524
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,796
Both of them, really,

525
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:55,712
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

526
00:39:55,712 --> 00:39:57,879
which were all absolutely.

527
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,879
But He talked absolutely…

528
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:05,088
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

529
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:07,213
and talked so openly.

530
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:11,004
Then, in the same way, we can say,

531
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:14,171
the Primordial Master state is that

532
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:18,004
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

533
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:23,046
He was also killed because He told the truth.

534
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,171
Then came Nanaka;

535
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:30,587
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

536
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:34,879
and the people who really follow Him are just

537
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:38,004
in the opposite direction.

538
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:40,587
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

539
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:43,754
so they are going in that way.

540
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:47,712
You find even same thing with Christ;

541
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:52,046
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

542
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,712
Every religion is just the same.

543
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:58,587
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

544
00:40:58,712 --> 00:41:02,129
Those who preach Gita are just…

545
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,796
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

546
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,670
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

547
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,129
going down, taking people down.

548
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:13,129
So it is common with all religions

549
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:18,879
that they have always used the name of prophets

550
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:26,088
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

551
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:33,088
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

552
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:36,587
So, now those who are alert about it,

553
00:41:36,587 --> 00:41:40,629
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

554
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:44,254
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

555
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:48,254
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

556
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:52,837
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

557
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:56,796
instead of going themselves down.

558
00:41:56,837 --> 00:42:02,670
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

559
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:06,670
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

560
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,296
If Athena could be awakened here,

561
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:13,587
this place could be of very great help to us.

562
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:19,796
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

563
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:24,587
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

564
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:30,171
also they have lots of qualities of

565
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:36,712
understanding the worthlessness of

566
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:43,670
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

567
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:46,046
But the immorality grew,

568
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:49,670
now, because they started copying Westerners;

569
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:53,088
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

570
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:57,754
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

571
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:01,629
Before that the women were very moral,

572
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:04,088
very good women lived here,

573
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:09,004
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

574
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,587
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

575
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:15,962
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

576
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:18,587
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

577
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:21,587
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

578
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:25,213
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

579
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:29,629
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

580
00:43:30,088 --> 00:43:33,004
They may use a woman who has no character

581
00:43:33,004 --> 00:43:35,213
but they respect the woman who has character

582
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,587
and also respect the mother.

583
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:41,004
So there are lots of qualities in this country

584
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:44,670
which are still existing,

585
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:49,213
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

586
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:53,629
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

587
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:59,921
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

588
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:03,254
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

589
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:05,837
May God bless you!

590
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:25,962
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

591
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:28,879
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

592
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:45,837
He was very much respected in India, always,

593
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,670
Alexander was very much respected in India,

594
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,921
and because he went away

595
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:56,629
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

596
00:44:57,837 --> 00:45:02,088
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

597
00:45:03,129 --> 00:45:05,296
I think he got quite detached

598
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:08,962
after coming to India. Anybody who has

599
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:13,129
come to invade India, and has really gained something

600
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:16,254
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

601
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,587
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

602
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:20,754
three hundred years.

603
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,712
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

604
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:27,587
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

605
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:31,629
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

606
00:45:31,837 --> 00:45:33,837
nothing went into their heads.

607
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:39,296
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

608
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,213
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

609
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:46,213
So many are there even now living in the forests.

610
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:52,088
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

611
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:55,587
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

612
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:59,004
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

613
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:02,712
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

614
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:06,587
who was at the time of Alexander.

615
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:11,296
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

616
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,796
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

617
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:17,962
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

618
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:23,213
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

619
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:24,754
to England;

620
00:46:26,837 --> 00:46:28,754
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

621
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:31,754
and the sign of awareness is this, that

622
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:35,088
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

623
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,921
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

624
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:44,712
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

625
00:46:44,879 --> 00:46:48,046
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

626
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:51,837
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

627
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:53,587
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

628
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,629
so he went back and told his king that,

629
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:58,754
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

630
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:00,670
They are not Muslims”.

631
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:04,629
So simple he was.

632
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:07,837
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

633
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:10,754
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

634
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:12,629
He was a nice man.

635
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,754
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

636
00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:18,171
but still certain respect they showed, like

637
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,962
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

638
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:23,670
They still call it Mumbai.

639
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:25,712
many words Mumbai

640
00:47:25,837 --> 00:47:29,962
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

641
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:32,754
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

642
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:34,254
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

643
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:36,712
so they call it Mumbai –

644
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,962
is the name of the Goddess.

645
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:41,171
So they didn’t want to change it.

646
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,712
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

647
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:46,837
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

648
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:49,088
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

649
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:50,670
I said, “It is.”

650
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:54,587
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

651
00:47:57,962 --> 00:48:01,088
So you see the… see the awareness,

652
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:03,754
you can see the awareness of people

653
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:09,129
because they were so aware about the serenity,

654
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:12,754
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

655
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,629
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

656
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:17,171
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

657
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:21,213
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

658
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:23,879
But the English could have gone and found out

659
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:27,754
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

660
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:29,046
But they did not.

661
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:32,046
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

662
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:34,754
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

663
00:48:35,254 --> 00:48:38,254
because, you see, that respect

664
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:41,129
for serenity and all these things,

665
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:45,921
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

666
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:49,879
Now the children of Britain

667
00:48:50,088 --> 00:48:53,629
are better, are very different, very different.

668
00:48:53,879 --> 00:48:57,254
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

669
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:04,796
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

670
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:09,796
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

671
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:11,962
they came with respect.

672
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:19,129
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

673
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:22,088
And now, as the time has passed,

674
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:24,670
I find Britishers have respect for others,

675
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,254
they’re respecting, many.

676
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:31,712
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

677
00:49:31,712 --> 00:49:35,670
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

678
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:44,962
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

679
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:47,796
That is the part lacking in England.

680
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:51,254
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

681
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:53,962
then what sort of a heart it must be?

682
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:57,796
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

683
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:08,171
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

684
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:14,754
respecting others, respecting their culture,

685
00:50:14,754 --> 00:50:18,879
respecting their lifestyle.

686
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:24,629
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

687
00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:28,587
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

688
00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:31,796
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

689
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,171
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

690
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,213
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

691
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:41,213
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

692
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:46,712
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

693
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:50,296
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

694
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:53,712
So that is there but just theory.

695
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:57,629
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

696
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:03,213
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

697
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:06,587
and fasting for South Africa.

698
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:10,296
So between the South African awareness

699
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,004
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

700
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:18,129
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

701
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:23,921
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

702
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:27,046
I think it can transform the whole world.

703
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:31,088
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

704
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:34,004
It has to be respect.

705
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:40,962
It is not insulting now,

706
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:44,629
but it is not positive respect.

707
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:48,712
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

708
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:52,296
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

709
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:55,213
This is what I have been talking about,

710
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:59,004
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

711
00:51:59,837 --> 00:52:03,962
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

712
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,712
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

713
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:09,712
because still they have a sense of respect.

714
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:16,670
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

715
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:22,046
That part is there, that one has to learn.

716
00:52:22,046 --> 00:52:26,046
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

717
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:33,129
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

718
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:36,962
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

719
00:52:36,962 --> 00:52:40,921
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

720
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:48,296
And respect is something from your heart.

721
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:52,712
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

722
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,129
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

723
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:59,879
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

724
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:03,046
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

725
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,296
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

726
00:53:08,879 --> 00:53:13,129
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

727
00:53:13,962 --> 00:53:17,004
and when that works out then

728
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:20,712
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

729
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:25,837
high state of understanding of Divinity.

730
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:31,088
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

731
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:35,712
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

732
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:39,254
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

733
00:53:39,254 --> 00:53:43,254
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

734
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,171
And that it’s not what you get,

735
00:53:46,587 --> 00:53:48,754
it’s not what you have,

736
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:53,879
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

737
00:53:56,962 --> 00:54:01,004
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

738
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:03,213
because there’s a big understanding

739
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,296
now between you and the Divine,

740
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:08,088
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

741
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:12,171
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

742
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:17,629
learn that respect, then things will work out.

743
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,796
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

744
00:54:19,837 --> 00:54:23,296
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

745
00:54:23,587 --> 00:54:25,046
May God bless you!
