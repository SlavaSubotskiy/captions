1
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:06,267
My joy knows no bounds

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:15,650
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

3
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:18,455
which we have named as Ganaraj.

4
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:58,108
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

5
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,918
to hold the outpour of your joy.

6
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:21,730
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

7
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:32,882
but the first son who was created. was Shri Ganesha.

8
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:44,263
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

9
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:47,075
as a symbol of motherhood,

10
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:52,218
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

11
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:22,324
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars,

12
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,142
is the Ganesh, Shri Ganesha.

13
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,403
All these symbols were created

14
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:40,213
for you the Sahaja Yogis to recognize them;

15
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,355
to recognize all these symbols

16
00:02:56,117 --> 00:03:00,538
is easier if you are a realized soul.

17
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:16,187
But we have had so many great realized souls in the past,

18
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:23,853
of very high quality,

19
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:30,679
and they recognized, they found out

20
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,301
the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

21
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:48,911
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

22
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:01,216
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra

23
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:07,107
we have got eight Ganeshas which are

24
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:10,563
manifesting vibrations, and were recognized

25
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,079
by great Saints of Maharashtra.

26
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:33,766
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

27
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:39,336
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

28
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:45,391
who have shraddha as the highest expression

29
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:47,893
of their emotion and mind.

30
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:07,197
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

31
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:13,377
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

32
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,976
their thoughts go to God.

33
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:36,430
Thanks to the Saints of that state that people

34
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:41,615
have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

35
00:05:56,966 --> 00:06:00,125
Unfortunately in the West,

36
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:05,513
where shraddha is something very superficial,

37
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:14,036
anything like this takes them to something very low,

38
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:20,177
something very dirty, filthy, unholy.

39
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,288
Instead of surrendering to the Sublime,

40
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:57,640
and enjoying the greatness of the Sublime,

41
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:02,522
they take to something very carnal,

42
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,355
which belongs to the flesh.

43
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:25,868
But still the people who are

44
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,105
living in simple ways in the villages, in the nature,

45
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:38,946
must have realized the importance of this holy mountain.

46
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,211
Thousands and thousands, millions of years back,

47
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:09,953
the Mother Earth started producing Her Ganesha.

48
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:25,379
It was first a huge ocean where Himalaya stands.

49
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:40,204
Himalaya gradually started coming out of that ocean,

50
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,099
in a flat way, like a Shiva-Linga,

51
00:08:56,801 --> 00:09:00,868
which is the expression as the manifestation of the animals,

52
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,069
they have the brains which are flat

53
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,618
in this way.

54
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,025
But when the Himalayas started coming out of that sea,

55
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,655
the Mother Earth was pushed on sides,

56
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,449
and the Mother Earth started

57
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,584
giving folds to Her sari, you can say.

58
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:36,675
Now, when that movement started,

59
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:43,290
the sari gave waves of vibrations in such a way

60
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:46,974
that at certain points it

61
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:52,893
rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha.

62
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,459
And it was, to begin with, of flat,

63
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,995
again the same types of the ...

64
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:43,627
But then, still more folds started coming up, much later,

65
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:48,828
when human brain started developing its ego.

66
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:07,140
So the whole of that land was pushed up

67
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:10,786
and another land joined it in such a manner

68
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:13,481
that it formed a apex,

69
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,835
pushed it.

70
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,624
The super-ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax.

71
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:45,340
That synchronizes with the human brain,

72
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,012
because the whole universe

73
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:50,814
is represented in our body as well.

74
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:11,336
Now, the central axis of the Mother Earth

75
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:14,615
acted as the spinal cord.

76
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,660
By this happening in the Himalayas,

77
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:35,538
again there was a big push onto all the mountains

78
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:38,870
which were to be created as Shri Ganesh

79
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:43,927
and they got into their final forms,

80
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,607
and the apex was created.

81
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,067
So the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas.

82
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:28,013
At the other end of these ranges

83
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:32,245
must be the highest mountain because it is pushed the most.

84
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:40,284
Mont Blanc should be higher than this one.

85
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,456
You see, when they pushed it,

86
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:54,567
Himalaya was brought up to a point, up to a point it went,

87
00:14:54,768 --> 00:15:00,430
and then the waves created Ganesha of a certain height,

88
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,219
not too much height.

89
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,782
So it was pushed on the right hand side more:

90
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:08,623
the ego went, you see, expression in Mont Blanc,

91
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,514
you see for example.

92
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:02,006
And on the other side, it was created another Ganesha

93
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:05,537
at the other end near Darjeeling.

94
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,670
Shri Mataji, is the Mont Blanc expression of Shri Ganesha also?

95
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,941
No, no, it is the expression of ego.

96
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:15,313
Ego, yes, it's in France.

97
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:38,312
So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling,

98
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:42,210
and you get the same kind of redness on that.

99
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:55,416
I have seen another Shri Ganesh created in Delphi

100
00:16:55,637 --> 00:17:00,145
where they say is the Nabhi of the Mother Earth.

101
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:26,228
Also when Shri Shiva is created, Linga is created,

102
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,127
along with Him always there is a Shri Ganesha created,

103
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:33,415
as in [AMBARNATH], where a drop of water

104
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:38,277
falls on a particular area and creates the Linga.

105
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:41,683
Plus that, another drop falls on another side

106
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:45,298
and creates Shri Ganesh, exactly like the face.

107
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,621
Now the ocean is the Father,

108
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:41,188
and the Mother Earth is your Mother,

109
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:48,587
but when the Mother Earth becomes a mountain,

110
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,142
She is called as the Father.

111
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:57,318
The reason is: She, at that height, can catch the Father

112
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,292
on top of Her head, as snow or as rain.

113
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,695
That is how a Mother becomes the Father,

114
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,399
and so She can perform

115
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
the complete function of a Father and a Mother.

116
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:46,988
In that state only Gauri, the Daughter of the Mountains,

117
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:50,414
conceived Shri Ganesha

118
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:54,368
without the help of the Father, immaculate.

119
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,132
The purity of the snow is hundred percent,

120
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,381
and that covers the Mother Earth,

121
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:17,089
gives the formation of Innocence.

122
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:32,617
All the filth and dirt that goes into the ocean

123
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:37,125
is clarified by the sun, which is also Shri Ganesha,

124
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:44,130
and is brought on top of the hills and mountains to cover it.

125
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,466
Well, this is Divine Ecology.

126
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:33,005
But to Ganesh it is a big problem to exist in a country

127
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,557
which doesn't worship it.

128
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,171
It has no sense of respect.

129
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:58,888
It is always aspired that they should climb over

130
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,988
with a very egotistical ambitions,

131
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,529
of a low level and outward.

132
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,910
When you see the mountains like this,

133
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:36,692
the idea that should come into a good human being would be,

134
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:42,538
O God, I can see You in this sublime form,

135
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:45,711
and how will I conquer my ignorance?

136
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:50,518
How will I climb over my mountain

137
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:54,547
of arrogance to look at You?

138
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,051
To a egotistical mind,

139
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:39,547
the mountain is for the joy of the eyes,

140
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:42,680
and the joy which is really not the joy,

141
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,474
but is a kind of a pleasure for them to see.

142
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,093
Their ego gets challenged

143
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:06,601
and they want to climb on the mountain that,

144
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:08,294
We are higher than You!

145
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,211
We had Himalayas for thousands

146
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,387
and thousands of years in India;

147
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,880
nobody ever thought of climbing it.

148
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:35,204
When the English came, they started it doing it first time.

149
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:45,049
Then the French, Portuguese, Spanish,

150
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,065
all of them all did this

151
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,432
and the Indians were looking at them bewildered,

152
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:51,328
What are they doing?

153
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,707
Why do they want to climb the mountains?

154
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,624
Is better to see them from distance

155
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:12,465
and adore them, than to climb over them to die.

156
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,753
But this egotistical mind can go further,

157
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:26,941
as in Switzerland it has gone,

158
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:30,306
that they try to ski over these mountains,

159
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:32,829
take the slopes to go down.

160
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,514
They go down in any case,

161
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:52,110
and they break their legs.

162
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:55,922
I told one Sahaja Yogi who wanted to come here for skiing,

163
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:59,016
I said, Don't go there, it's not allowed by Sahaja Yoga,

164
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,342
and he came back with broken legs.

165
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:21,325
So every way the games are also such

166
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:25,276
that it's just a satisfaction of the ego.

167
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:37,421
I can understand small children going over a slide,

168
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:42,546
but big old men moving like this for hours together,

169
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,726
have they no other work to do?

170
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:58,003
That shows they have no maturity of any kind,

171
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:02,761
they are still stupid children playing with the snow.

172
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:05,518
There are the bhoots of all the skiers around,

173
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,415
I think Shri Mataji is talking to all of us.

174
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,401
By all these doings, what happens

175
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:24,047
that the holy places become like cemeteries.

176
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,717
Imagine, instead of putting flowers on Shri Ganesha

177
00:27:42,918 --> 00:27:45,230
you are putting dead bodies on His Body.

178
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:59,702
And, while skiing, putting those hard nails

179
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:02,619
into the Body of Shri Ganesh.

180
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,660
It's true.

181
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:19,810
There is no sense of respect.

182
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:30,135
Perhaps we don't respect ourselves, we are not mature enough.

183
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:37,474
The first thing that should happen,

184
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,853
that one folds his hands to Shri Ganesh

185
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,892
and just sees those things.

186
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:46,108
Just this should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

187
00:29:08,777 --> 00:29:11,310
So the innocence has to be developed to have that respect;

188
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,511
if you are not innocent, you cannot have respect.

189
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,269
And in the Innocence you don't think

190
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,199
you are the wisest of all

191
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,399
and make everybody look like a fool,

192
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:36,115
nor do you laugh at others and make fun of them,

193
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,838
nor do you play games and put people down.

194
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:59,207
But what I have seen, even coming to Sahaja Yoga,

195
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,910
this is the worst part of it,

196
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:02,535
I have seen people who play games

197
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:04,189
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

198
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:20,301
They gossip and say all kinds of wrong things

199
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,502
which I've never said before.

200
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:35,778
There was so many kinds of things I hear

201
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:40,885
that I'm amazed how Sahaja Yogis are such creators of gossips.

202
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:55,360
Is this the way Ganesha would behave towards the Mother?

203
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:03,929
That thinking yourself to be great people you say,

204
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,583
Mother said so, and this happened, and that happened.

205
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:19,129
Ego is anti-innocence,

206
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:26,271
and that's why this kind of a nonsensical gossip people do,

207
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:28,512
which I can't understand, it is so filthy,

208
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:30,065
I just can't understand.

209
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:42,939
Like there was one lady whom nobody would marry,

210
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,075
and there was only one fellow

211
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:47,632
who accepted to marry that woman,

212
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,761
and that's how the marriage took place.

213
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:01,690
Now this lady, or perhaps somebody who is like her,

214
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:04,760
has spread stories that she was the most beautiful woman,

215
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,885
everybody wanted to marry her, everybody raised their hands.

216
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:10,078
I never asked people to raise their hands.

217
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:14,101
It's not like that at all. When I heard it, I was shocked:

218
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,685
this woman, nobody wanted to marry her.

219
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,730
There are all kinds of things

220
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,790
that you have got from your past,

221
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:45,975
and you must try to get out of it,

222
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,178
otherwise you cannot rise high.

223
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:04,458
A person who is not innocent cannot worship Shri Ganesh.

224
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,798
In His right hand He has got a Parashu, you must know that,

225
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:17,537
a terrible instrument, you see, with one stroke

226
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:20,339
He takes out your head, like guillotine it is.

227
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:36,667
Those who are not innocent, play games, try tricks,

228
00:33:36,868 --> 00:33:40,610
gossip, indulge in filth, He cuts them out.

229
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,742
Innocence is a very sharp thing.

230
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:03,685
It does not have any compromise,

231
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:06,346
which you can see in the life of Christ.

232
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:13,011
With His trunk He throws people

233
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,579
left and right and throws them out.

234
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,674
He sees for a while, and if people remain still half-baked,

235
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,900
they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

236
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,116
No one should think that you have got Realization,

237
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:56,157
you can be in the Sahaja Yoga

238
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:59,270
if you do not take to innocence.

239
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,368
Innocence gives you complete sincerity,

240
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:19,665
and Ganesha is the judge,

241
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:26,273
and He is the one who throws you out

242
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:31,036
of the periphery like a tangent you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,196
And when you get out of Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:44,166
you start going down and down and down,

245
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,994
and then you may develop horrible diseases

246
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:48,195
of the Mooladhara chakra.

247
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,867
Those who are hit by Him are the worst;

248
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,366
if you have come near Him, be careful.

249
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:21,222
Face yourself, see yourself, note yourself.

250
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:30,398
Another thing they told Me that some people

251
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,953
think that they are great Sahaja Yogis

252
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:36,482
who contribute nothing to Sahaja Yoga but headaches.

253
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:52,166
If some sane Sahaja Yogi starts telling

254
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:57,267
the other Sahaja Yogi about something sensible,

255
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,595
this fellow puts up his right Vishuddhi,

256
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,243
pressing it hard on him to show that,

257
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:05,368
You are talking because your right Vishuddhi is catching,

258
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:06,569
very cunning.

259
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:35,642
You are not to play games, because you are harming yourself,

260
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:37,132
I'm telling you now.

261
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:47,704
Those who think they can play with the loopholes

262
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:51,296
must know that there's a loop round their neck.

263
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,782
Like the fallen angels you will go to the greater heights,

264
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:29,029
or depths, of mire.

265
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,392
So try to be honest to yourself.

266
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:01,508
Any nation has any problem,

267
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:06,474
any sins they have been committing or have committed before,

268
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,131
should not be any more [a tag] with you.

269
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:29,584
If a country has been cunning, then you should be innocent.

270
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:41,703
If you are coming from a foxy clan, you have to be innocent.

271
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:50,282
Like you are coming from a thuggery clan,

272
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:54,068
then you have to be extremely astute.

273
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,571
If you are coming from the romantic clan,

274
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,750
you have to be extremely pure.

275
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:17,189
You have to be juxtaposition

276
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,272
of whatever sins we are suffering from.

277
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:30,349
If you are the light in the darkness,

278
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,300
you have to be brilliant and not dark,

279
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:42,736
and you have to give light in the darkness, to the dark,

280
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,624
not to take dark upon yourself.

281
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,549
So, if you really feel that the past

282
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,893
of your country has been such and such,

283
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:01,689
you better study it and know for yourself

284
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,461
that you have to be just different.

285
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:22,538
Some are comfort-loving, they should get out of that.

286
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:29,922
Some are pleasure-loving, they should get out of that.

287
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:38,301
Some are tempted with women and men

288
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:39,667
and drinking and all that,

289
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:42,571
you should completely give up and come out of it.

290
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:55,472
There are deeper sins we have of cunningness,

291
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:58,501
of aggressiveness, of slyness,

292
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:03,626
all these thing are to be studied and understood

293
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,274
that what do we have to do for our country

294
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:09,118
is to get out of it completely first of all,

295
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,366
like the lotus out of the mire.

296
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,708
If your country is racist,

297
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:35,549
then you have to become absolutely

298
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,276
a person completely integrated.

299
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:51,067
Like that you have to be on the [JUXTAPOSITION]

300
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:54,447
to rise higher than the rest of them

301
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:57,765
to give them a proper lead.

302
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:12,635
I can tell you that Shiva tolerates lot of nonsense,

303
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:17,718
because he is fond of forgiving,

304
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:30,572
and Vishnu principle tries to play with them

305
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:33,444
and punish them or kill them.

306
00:43:41,498 --> 00:43:46,743
But Ganesha Tattwa has no compromise of any kind,

307
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,295
and when this become Ekadesha Rudra,

308
00:43:55,496 --> 00:43:58,284
and when Christ is going to come in that form,

309
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:01,504
then there will be no compromise, no Mataji,

310
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:04,284
no crying, no argument, nothing;

311
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:26,450
Shri Ganesha Himself will throw people into hell.

312
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:32,886
So be careful on that!

313
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,231
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

314
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:37,281
you have to take an oath that,

315
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:40,098
Whatever is the past of my country,

316
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:43,533
I will get opposite to that.

317
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:02,924
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

318
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,432
money matters they can be very horrid,

319
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:10,296
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

320
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:12,260
So, one has to know that we have to be

321
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,859
absolutely astute as far as money is concerned.

322
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:31,711
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

323
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:34,805
but it is more that it should be proved,

324
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,826
that people should know that you are innocent!

325
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,215
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

326
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:56,835
whether this would be honesty, so he answered,

327
00:45:57,036 --> 00:46:01,101
This may be honesty for outside purpose,

328
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:04,481
but it is not in the essence of honesty.

329
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:22,884
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

330
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:29,557
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

331
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,740
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

332
00:46:37,186 --> 00:46:40,500
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

333
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:49,996
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

334
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:57,461
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

335
00:46:57,662 --> 00:47:00,443
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

336
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:12,019
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

337
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:20,919
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

338
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:31,010
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

339
00:47:36,193 --> 00:47:38,497
That is the sign of your character,

340
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:43,868
and of your strength,

341
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:48,527
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

342
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:49,963
which is enlightened within you,

343
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:56,242
has given you that strength and that new dimension.

344
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:07,726
So the second oath we have to take

345
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,164
before Shri Ganesha is that,

346
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:12,624
I will be honest to myself.

347
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:25,086
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake.

348
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:34,180
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

349
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:38,271
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

350
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:50,404
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

351
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:53,161
how He adored His Mother,

352
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:02,434
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

353
00:49:07,232 --> 00:49:10,544
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

354
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:24,471
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

355
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:30,406
and the greatest wisdom He has:

356
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:33,938
that it is better to worship the Mother than anybody else,

357
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,622
because She is the Power.

358
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:48,204
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

359
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,922
you have to go through the Mother,

360
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,803
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

361
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,322
All His security, all His powers, all His beauty,

362
00:50:07,523 --> 00:50:09,733
innocence, comes from His Mother.

363
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:20,519
So with the third oath you have to take that,

364
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,874
For us, our Mother is so powerful,

365
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:26,153
why should we be afraid of anything?

366
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,026
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

367
00:50:41,227 --> 00:50:44,578
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?

368
00:50:52,485 --> 00:50:55,070
I appear very innocent sometimes,

369
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:03,120
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

370
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:26,930
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

371
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,931
But people like Shri Ganesh

372
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:39,124
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

373
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,492
The another oath we have to take today

374
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:56,794
that, we'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

375
00:51:56,995 --> 00:52:01,393
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

376
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:16,600
We'll not make fun of them,

377
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:20,025
we'll not laugh at them,

378
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:25,071
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

379
00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:30,302
But they can be thrown away,

380
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,649
they can get out of it.

381
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,049
But unless and until this happens,

382
00:52:41,715 --> 00:52:46,793
do not put your ego on other people.

383
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:53,344
Don't think that you understand everything.

384
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,065
Don't think that you know everything.

385
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:04,565
Respect each and every person,

386
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:10,831
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

387
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:13,844
but because he is a great soul.

388
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,166
I feel the whole West suffers from one,

389
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,448
one simple disease, that is, they do not know

390
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:31,633
how to respect anyone.

391
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,786
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

392
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,670
they will never accept nor will respect.

393
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,327
With their ego they want to judge everyone

394
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,091
and condemn everyone.

395
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,461
So, get out of it,

396
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:04,761
and tell yourself, I don't know anything.

397
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:12,339
I was a stupid fool with my ego.

398
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:20,423
Humble down yourself in your heart, open your heart,

399
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,079
and love each other.

400
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:33,488
Respect and love is the two things

401
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:36,142
you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

402
00:54:40,595 --> 00:54:44,470
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

403
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:50,742
May God bless you!
