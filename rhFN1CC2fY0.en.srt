00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:32,840
unfortunately or fortunately you are

6
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,240
born in these modern times and in these

7
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,330
modern times as you know it's a very

8
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,060
chaotic condition in these chaotic

9
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,640
conditions you don't know what is right

10
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:50,119
and what is wrong and there are all

11
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:53,780
kinds of attractions which can take of

12
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,679
your attention and reduce the energy of

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,679
your attention

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:07,250
it is possible more for the people who

15
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:10,250
are very right-sided also the left-sided

16
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,980
people can be very much affected the

17
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,640
right-sided people as you know go up to

18
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:20,120
a point and become extremely dry

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:24,110
self-opinionated and address all their

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,590
attention is in aggression while the

21
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:37,670
people who are on the left side are

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:41,930
indulging too much into their own both

23
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,470
sides can tear away your attention which

24
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,070
is the most important it is the most

25
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:52,400
valuable thing is your attention but the

26
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:58,070
attention cannot be controlled by a

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,859
person who doesn't have a weak mind or a

28
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,290
weak heart

29
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:06,260
in every field of life where there it is

30
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,980
political economic or any field of life

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,930
in which human beings are living there

32
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:20,329
is a very subtle problem which people

33
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:23,959
don't understand now if I say that there

34
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,880
is spirit within us which shines in our

35
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,900
heart

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:34,860
you need not believe need not

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:38,799
but our attention is not on the spirit

38
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:44,019
they call it at Mojave mook our

39
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:47,200
attention is outside at this stage at

40
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:52,180
the human awareness our attention is

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:56,519
outside outside in various things now

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:02,650
where should our attention go to evolve

43
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:08,489
for what to achieve what the firstly our

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,489
attention has now go towards our spirit

45
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:17,739
towards spiritual understanding so what

46
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,530
have you

47
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,150
first of all by God's grace as I told

48
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,039
you

49
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,150
you all are realized people so your

50
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:31,060
ascent is made in the center which is a

51
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:35,560
very very difficult thing absolutely

52
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:39,639
difficult notice but you should learn to

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,310
keep in the center but how to keep the

54
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,380
attention is in the center is the

55
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:50,280
problem for many people who are still

56
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,280
not above themselves

57
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:03,820
now when you meditate try to meditate in

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,650
a sustained way

59
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:12,910
first of all sustained then you find

60
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:19,290
that you are getting into the state of

61
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:22,480
Samadhi means at a state where you start

62
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,930
feeling the joy and the Bliss of God's

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:30,340
blessings and then you start saying for

64
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:34,810
God what a blessing what a blessing and

65
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:45,360
what a bliss once you have reached a

66
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:45,360
state then you have to realize Who am I

67
00:05:46,350 --> 00:06:04,770
who are what are you are the spent after

68
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:09,780
establishing your sustained attention on

69
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:12,980
the spirit you will develop a state

70
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:17,870
where you will be in a complete state of

71
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,870
witnessing with joy

72
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:39,970
[Music]

73
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,820
you say something about maintaining our

74
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,820
attention to that stage that it should

75
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,750
customers asked a very practical

76
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,070
question is true that to keep the

77
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,580
attention where it should be you see for

78
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:12,940
everything you have to do some exercise

79
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,940
a bath not before realization after them

80
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,750
the best way is to learn how to watch

81
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,850
yourself just start sitting here just

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,460
put yourself into a position for where

83
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,460
you watch yourself now what am i doing

84
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,080
this is the bass this is the study apart

85
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,900
from mantras apart from anything the

86
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:46,500
abuse is the practice practice of

87
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:48,720
becoming a witness and the witness is

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,490
the spirit state their attention will

89
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,080
not go i mean you will see everything is

90
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:57,990
that attention will be inside try to

91
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,750
practice this a my business now say some

92
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,480
people say oh I had a horrible time

93
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,090
whether this happened that happened see

94
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,510
you are not a witness how can you have a

95
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,980
horrible time if you are the spirit you

96
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,590
only have a horrible time when you are

97
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,050
not the spirit if you can wash the whole

98
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,180
thing as a drama that is played then you

99
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,040
are not having a horrible time but this

100
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,790
outside of you is having horrible time

101
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:29,940
with your watch that's how the attention

102
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,570
can be fixed very well if you practice

103
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,969
of the Asura practice all the time to be

104
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,680
witness say you go up out you see

105
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:44,039
something just try see it not to think

106
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,070
about it be a witness of the world the

107
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,590
joy will be complete and also you will

108
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,300
become absolutely peaceful your

109
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,270
attention will be completely enlightened

110
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,290
and then the inspiration you will get me

111
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,290
the tremendous

112
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:16,029
oh we test is very different from paying

113
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,570
attention paying attention is a

114
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:23,230
deliberate thing you deliberately pay

115
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,360
attention see to something as I'm

116
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,100
talking you may not be realized you may

117
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,800
be realized you can pay attention to me

118
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,829
but witnessing is a state say I'll

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,720
submit myself what happens if there's a

120
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,390
problem or there's some calamity

121
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,800
something suddenly I find and we're

122
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:48,269
testing the whole thing like a drama

123
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,269
it's a state but you can develop it
