1
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:10,549
yesterday I was talking about two things, 
which we have to do in England, which one

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:17,990
should understand, you see. Because every 
country has its own problems and we do absorb

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,370
the problems.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:28,390
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi sounds 
like “Left hamari aur kar. Left hand, ha.]

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:43,579
[In Hindi: Point your left hand towards Me, 
point your right hand outwards].

6
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:58,249
Now the thing is our work is spreading very 
fast and people are taking to it. In Europe

7
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:07,730
I find the land is much more fertile, surprisingly 
and once people get realization they become

8
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,400
fantastic, I mean they think it’s something 
that they have been expecting and they understand

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,220
Sahaj Yoga much better than we understand 
here. Though your Kundalinis rise very high,

10
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:28,140
I’ve seen that, but the progress is not 
that all right.

11
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,370
Now Ray has been to India, he’ll tell you 
how, what sort of people we have in India

12
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,830
and how they have progressed themselves. Now 
as I said the main problem of our country

13
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,260
is lethargy and lethargy is something we have 
to overcome somehow and this lethargy is a,

14
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:59,210
actually a satanic force. It’s not lethargy 
only of the matter that comes from material

15
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:07,690
domination on the Spirit, but it is really 
satanic because it stops your progress and

16
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:17,200
is to be avoided. And to get out of it one 
has to be really alert about it, how it crawls

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,760
onto you. Krishna has put, the worst vice 
in the whole world is “aalasya”, means

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,190
lethargy. “Aalasyso Bijayate” – everything 
comes out of aalasya. According to Him, first

19
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:38,640
the lethargy comes in and because of lethargy 
we get into vices and then we go to the right

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,450
side also because of lethargy. Because just 
to avoid the lethargy we go to the right side

21
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:54,360
too much. So according to Him everything starts 
with lethargy and then the person loses the

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:03,360
essence of life through lethargy and this 
is our special quality and that is our real

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,849
problem – is the lethargy.

24
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,630
Because Sahaj Yoga is a thing where we say 
there is “akriya”. We don’t have to

25
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:18,170
do anything. It is effortless. Everything 
works out effortless, spontaneously. So we

26
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,349
think that everything is going to work out 
for us spontaneously. Only the Kundalini Jagruti

27
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:33,040
is spontaneous for the first time, not for 
the second time, only for the first time.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,890
That is I have to do it or My photograph has 
to do it. But afterwards you have to work,

29
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,340
you have to keep your Kundalini afloat. You 
have to understand what are your problems,

30
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:56,040
what are you getting into. I mean, individually 
every one of you is a masterpiece, individually.

31
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,489
Because of lethargy you are clouded.

32
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:07,400
Secondly because of lethargy you are secluded, 
lethargy gives you also ego. Because anything

33
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,569
that challenges lethargy you get on top of 
that person, you don’t like such a person.

34
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,789
But the lethargy also those do not have are 
the people their attention is not on spiritual

35
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,940
development. Theirs is as I told you yesterday, 
on other things, which are not important to

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:33,020
spiritual life. We pay so much attention to 
other things than to our spiritual life. Why

37
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,530
is it? Why is it we pay more attention to 
material things, to material comforts, to

38
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:46,960
material achievements, to material obsessions? 
Why? You must think about it. And why not

39
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,380
to our spiritual ascent? The reason is we 
have been identified with matter. We have

40
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:02,150
been going through that circle. We thought 
that we must have material development, so

41
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:09,160
we had industrial revolution, we created a 
society dominated by industries, machinery

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:17,160
came up. We saw the machinery started dominating 
us. We wanted to misidentify from that machinery.

43
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:25,389
Machinery has also given us lethargy because 
we use machine made things our hands do not

44
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:25,790
work.

45
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,690
We have lost all the deftness of the hands; 
we have lost all the walking capacity. We

46
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:41,210
can only take a bus or a car; we do not want 
to walk at all. Now this mechanization and

47
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:50,919
the use of matter too much, has made us sort 
of matters ourself. We have become matter

48
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,270
that we cannot live without it, it, yet we 
are so identified with it. After realization

49
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,009
if you are still identified with the matter, 
then your realization slows down.

50
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:13,639
So to, one has to understand, one has to understand 
fully that matter is absolutely secondary.

51
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,949
Without of course getting your body you cannot 
receive realization, you have to have your

52
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:28,280
body. But matter which is gross, is of no 
meaning. Subtle matter is all right for us,

53
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,650
that’s important. Like this light, which 
is burning, is important. Water that is in

54
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,740
the ocean is all right. The sky, open sky 
– say here it is not so good but if you

55
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,650
go to a country is even better. The Mother 
Earth say example here, I don’t know how

56
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:55,520
it is, but in India certain places Mother 
Earth is very much subtle, your material identifications.

57
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,220
So matter has been identified with us, we 
have been using it, living with it and that’s

58
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:07,740
why it is easy for us to get back into the 
same circle of matter. And we get into it,

59
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,590
we pay attention more to it. Now if I say, 
“Do not pay attention to it more,” then

60
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,880
you go on to another side, in a subtler way 
you jump into vices.

61
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:30,710
Vices of – I can say uncleanliness, filth, 
dirt, mismanagement. So from one extreme to

62
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,389
another extreme you go. Now in the center 
what is matter, we should understand, and

63
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:44,639
we should try to then identify ourselves with 
our Spirit. Now what is matter? Let us find

64
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,960
out. What is matter this. And what is created 
out of matter?

65
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,690
Matter you know is made out of five elements. 
You know the five elements, which have made

66
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:07,160
this body of ours. And these five elements 
are on the right-hand side of the human beings

67
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:16,270
and these five elements either push you towards 
the left side or pull you towards the right

68
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:24,389
side. I mean to say that when your start using 
the matter gradually you become lethargic.

69
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:30,130
You become slave to it, it forms a habit. 
If you use a chair then you cannot sit on

70
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,120
the ground. If you are used to a comfortable 
life, you cannot live in an uncomfortable

71
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:45,459
life. Sort of it slaves you. Secondly, if 
you try to overpower the matter, getting overactive

72
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,690
with matter, you make everything properly 
and make everything nicely and everything;

73
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:59,890
you are over efficient with the matter, then 
your ego develops and when your ego develops

74
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:06,830
you go into violence. Because if you produce 
more, you have to be violent about it otherwise

75
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:17,260
you do not know how to sell it. You become, 
sort-of an aggressive businessman or a country,

76
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,440
which tries to sell the matter, which tries 
to overpower other nations with their material

77
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:32,360
advancement. With violence you go little further, 
then what becomes out of you is nothing but

78
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,810
you become materialistic. 
And materialistic people have no heart. A

79
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,450
materialistic person has no heart. He is just 
dried up. [10.02] He only understands money,

80
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,230
money and money. He doesn’t go beyond it. 
So too much attachment to money is also materialistic,

81
00:09:51,230 --> 00:10:00,160
waste of money is also materialistic; mismanagement 
of money is the worst of all. So to be materialistic

82
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,670
is your nature. You have started with it. 
That’s human nature to be materialistic

83
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:14,120
because we have started with matter. But it 
is also the human nature to ascend. As it

84
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:25,260
is natural to be a beast, it is more natural 
to be a Sahaj Yogi. So both things are part

85
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,170
of the nature. Now which way you go is the 
thing. Now the ladder can take you up or can

86
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,000
bring you down. If you have to go up your 
eyes should be upward.

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,430
Now these five elements create what within 
you? They create the five chakras within you

88
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:49,380
or you can say the six chakras are created 
out of these five elements. And these five

89
00:10:49,380 --> 00:11:05,360
elements, when they create the chakras then 
they also give us a support to have the deities’

90
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:13,269
aasana, a seat for the deities to come in. 
So they are important. But if you have to

91
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:23,399
give a deity a seat, you do not give some 
sort of a filthy seat. You give a nice, the

92
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:37,670
best seat, whatever is available, to the deity. 
So you must know that when you are using the

93
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:46,120
matter, see the auspiciousness of it. You 
have to know the auspiciousness of things

94
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,510
that you are using, whether it is auspicious 
or not. At random we buy clothes. At random

95
00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:02,870
we buy things. If you could use your vibratory 
awareness to buy your things to see what you

96
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:09,899
should buy, what would look nice because beauty 
and auspiciousness goes hand in hand. They

97
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:16,339
are not two things. Because beauty is a thing 
that gives joy to your Spirit, auspiciousness

98
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:23,360
is the same, which gives joy to your Spirit. 
All other beauty is no beauty

99
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:33,350
So for a Sahaj Yogi it is necessary to use 
all the matters, which are auspicious. Now

100
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,380
auspicious matters, whatever are there, which 
are important matters must be kept at a higher

101
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:48,079
level always. For example say My photograph, 
is very auspicious. Then you don’t put it

102
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:58,660
on the ground, then don’t trample over it. 
In that also there are gradations of auspiciousness.

103
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,450
But now your clothes because you are saints 
now, are very important. You are saints do

104
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:14,820
you realize? Do you realize your self-esteem? 
You are saints now. What clothes you wear,

105
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:22,640
you are not vagabonds. You are not tramps. 
You are not on the street. So you have to

106
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,810
wear dignified dress. I have told everyone 
of you that, “Wear something dignified,

107
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:36,829
not indignified.” It has to be majestic, 
because you are a saint now. You are no more

108
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:45,170
a person running on the street, you are the 
selected saints by God. So the dress you wear

109
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:53,820
need not be absurd or something funny but 
should give you dignity. Not any false but

110
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,200
a real dignity. You see the vibrations of 
a dress. Wear your country’s dress. You

111
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,870
need not wear somebody else’s dress or something, 
but the interest in the dress should be that

112
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,700
it should give you dignity and a sense of 
respectability.

113
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:17,220
It is to preserve your respect that you have 
to wear a dress. That is the utility of a

114
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,660
dress.

115
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,370
And now you go to another thing, anything 
that you are using, for example your house.

116
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:35,110
Your house should be a house of cheerfulness, 
a house of dignity where people come in, they

117
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,100
have comfort, they sit comfortably. 
But too much comfort is against Sahaj Yoga.

118
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,279
But spartan also is not necessary that you 
do not have anything to spread on the ground

119
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,660
or something. It should be comfortable. But 
it should not be comfort personified, because

120
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,420
comfort creeps on you.

121
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,670
Comfort is one thing is better for English 
people to avoid completely, is very good for

122
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,410
them not to allow the body to get into comfortable 
positions. Specially bathroom addiction is

123
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,730
too much in English people I have seen it. 
It is so much so I was so surprised that if

124
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,430
I go supposing to a reception I can tell you 
whether it is owned by an Englishman or by

125
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,089
somebody else. If it is owned by an Englishman, 
the bathroom will be done up very well, there

126
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:29,920
will be towel for everything, soap for everything, 
I mean they are extremely particular. And

127
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:39,440
immediately I know that it is done by some 
English gentleman, because they are very bathroom

128
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:50,320
conscious. Though they do not take baths. 
I have seen houses with sixty bedrooms and

129
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,949
no bath in England only. Now of course they 
have started. Bathing is not their quality.

130
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,329
But bathroom – they are very particular.

131
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:09,350
And even if you put an easy chair they wouldn’t 
mind sitting in a bathroom. And as far as

132
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,500
bathroom is concerned one should just form 
such habits, that within ten minutes you should

133
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,790
be out from the bathroom. Now when I say you 
have to take your baths, that doesn’t mean

134
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,560
that early in the morning go and take a shower, 
it doesn’t mean that. You should take a

135
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,290
bath at a time when you’ll have one hour 
before going out, but that also from auspicious

136
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:39,240
point of view. Now you are saints, so use 
water as much as you can. Wash your hands

137
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,149
ten times is very essential. To get your vibrations 
all right, you must wash your hands. But now

138
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:51,920
in India there are people who wash their hands 
countingly sixty four times. And I always

139
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,870
warn about the another side of it, like doctors 
go on washing their hands. In the same way,

140
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,920
there are some people who go on washing their 
hands. You need not take out the skin out

141
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:08,199
of your hands. But as many times as you wash 
your hands, it is a good thing. I mean you

142
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:14,339
are saints but you are children. And I have 
to talk to you as to the children who are

143
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,899
saints. It’s a big complication. While you 
are grown up people and sometimes you might

144
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:26,529
feel hurt also, the way I have to tell you, 
but this is important that you have to understand

145
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:34,830
that, “We are saints and as saints, what 
we have to do as far as the matter is concerned.”

146
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:45,789
Now in a house there should be no dearth. 
Dearth is not the sign of a saintliness. Miserliness:

147
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:53,729
dearth – you come to somebody’s house 
and you find a miserable beggary hole. That

148
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:59,419
kind of a thing should not be. You must have 
proper plates, proper things or a broken plate

149
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:07,389
somewhere, no. All these things should be 
clean, neat, maybe handmade, or even if you

150
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:12,100
don’t get handmade, but they should be clean, 
auspicious. If you can get handmade things,

151
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,429
nothing like it. That’s a very good idea 
if you can get hand made things and if you

152
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,850
can use them it’s very good.

153
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,929
I think we went to see Gandhiji’s ashram, 
didn’t we? You saw it was a simple place

154
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:31,239
but very well done, everything. And that way 
Japanese are very good at these things; one

155
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:36,519
has to learn a lot from them. You have to 
learn from so many people and because of Zen

156
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:42,269
influence, the Japanese picked up the aesthetics 
of life. Very simple house they will have

157
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:48,769
but everything very comfortable. And they 
know how to make the house look beautiful

158
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:58,720
and how to make people feel comfortable.

159
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:20,100
[Shri Mataji speaks aside] Matter is to be 
treated with respect because it is created

160
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:29,470
by God. But whatever is respected is to be 
respected – not everything. Everything in

161
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:39,210
the matter is not to be respected. For example, 
if you see some sort of a painting, which

162
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,729
is, which is not auspicious, is not auspicious. 
You should refuse to see such a painting.

163
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,909
You should avoid seeing such painting because 
it is not going to give you any joy, any happiness,

164
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:55,759
nothing. It’s not going to work out. < Now 
one of the things which people always tell

165
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:08,139
Me that in … “Sahaj Yogis do not have 
a presence.” This is a very important thing.

166
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:16,749
The presence is done by matter. Now our presence, 
if it is not all right people can make it

167
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:24,929
out. All things that are in us, if they become 
auspicious will have a presence. Wherever

168
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:33,779
we’ll stand people will know there’s a 
presence. And this presence is a blessing

169
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:41,330
of the matter to us. So you must respect matter 
in the sense what clothes you wear. Throwing

170
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,529
clothes on the ground, throwing here and there, 
living like a donkey, like a pigsty, is not

171
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:56,379
the way a Sahaj Yogi should live. He has to 
be orderly; he has to respect his clothes.

172
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:00,049
But it should not be that you respect your 
clothes so much that you throw away others’

173
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,099
clothes. The others are Sahaj Yogis also. 
You have to respect each other because you

174
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:13,239
are all saints. If you respect yourself you 
have to respect others. And once you start

175
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:20,349
respecting the matter, which is the essence 
in you, that is attention. The essence of

176
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:31,830
matter is attention. Attention gives you the 
presence. For example – recently Marie was

177
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,239
with Me. While translating Me, she suddenly 
saw some flowers here and there, she started

178
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:42,549
putting them right. It created a very funny 
situation. Everybody started seeing what’s

179
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:49,399
matter with this woman? But now she’s understood 
it. And now I told her that, “When you are

180
00:21:49,399 --> 00:22:00,149
speaking you should say it with full concentration. 
Your attention, where is your attention?”

181
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:07,450
If your attention is on money, even if I am 
talking about the highest things you’ll

182
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,899
be thinking about money. If your attention 
is on something else, even if I am talking

183
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:20,330
to something, you will be thinking of something 
else. That’s why our presence should be

184
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:29,929
such that nobody’s attention is diverted 
or deluded. You understand My point? If your

185
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:36,369
presence is funny, like a joker or a clown 
or a funny, untidy, everybody’s attention

186
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:44,169
will be disturbed. If you are overly dressed 
also the attention will be disturbed. But

187
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:51,539
if you are completely a presence then wherever 
you stand, people will feel there is somebody

188
00:22:51,539 --> 00:23:00,009
standing, great. The respect flows, actually 
respect flows. And it is something so remarkable

189
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:11,059
that you don’t know how people try to help 
you then and how it works out. Your attention

190
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:17,639
if it is dominated by matter, people can make 
it out. And that is one thing has to look

191
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:26,779
after very clearly because these are countries 
who have advanced so much in material advancement.

192
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:32,229
So what happens, every matter attracts your 
attention. You go on the street there’s

193
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:38,289
this one woman is standing or there is something 
selling, this happening. All the time the

194
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,720
attention … You see it is their job to attract 
your attention, otherwise how are they going

195
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,739
to exploit you? See, they will have no justification. 
So they produce things, advertise things,

196
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:53,590
to do in such a way to distract your attention. 
Now this is a force, which is acting against

197
00:23:53,590 --> 00:24:00,460
our attention. So as far as possible keep 
your attention straight, or on the Mother

198
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,049
Earth. If you can control your attention, 
you can overcome your material domination.

199
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:14,950
Now the best thing is to put attention to 
your Spirit. If you start putting your attention

200
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,950
to Spirit, the sweetness of the Spirit itself 
will make the whole thing very sweet and beautiful.

201
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,460
The attention should be in the Spirit. Even 
you are getting ready; keep the attention

202
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,960
on the Spirit. Now it’s not difficult because 
Kundalini has reached that stage. Before realization

203
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,950
if I had said it, then you would have said, 
“Mother, how to do it?” But now when you

204
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:42,059
have got realization, try to bring your attention 
to Spirit. Means first when the Kundalini

205
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:49,799
rises you start looking at the Spirit or you 
say when you get realization you see the Spirit.

206
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,609
In the sense that the Spirit starts flowing 
through you, you start watching its flowing

207
00:24:53,609 --> 00:25:01,619
in this thing. But then after some time, you 
must enter into Spirit and [DEL: see,] see

208
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:08,629
through the window of the Spirit, the whole 
thing by developing your witness Spirit. If

209
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:25,049
you develop your witness state, from attention 
you become knowledge, the truth. Then material

210
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:33,690
things become the knowledge; aesthetics of 
matter start giving you joy. You do not want

211
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,919
to possess it, but they start giving you joy 
and even if you want to posses it, it would

212
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,929
be just to enjoy it and give it away to somebody 
else. It’s like that. It’s for your enjoyment

213
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:55,460
and you want to give it away to someone else. 
When you develop your witness state this will

214
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:03,099
come to you that you will not keep things 
to yourself but you would like to give and

215
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:09,809
share, sharing. That is the time you should 
know you have become a witness, because you

216
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:16,229
are enjoying. Witness state is the state of 
Shri Krishna, of Virat. When you start sharing

217
00:26:16,229 --> 00:27:12,169
your things then it 
is a proper thing. Now the essence of puja 
is also how to overcome our material grossness.

218
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:24,379
Puja is nothing but is how to overcome our 
material grossness. When we want to have a

219
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:33,460
matter to ourselves, we must know that it 
is given to us by God. Everything belongs

220
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,109
to God. Supposing we give flower to God, after 
all it is God’s own creation, what are we

221
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:46,619
giving? We show light to God or do ‘aarti’ 
to God. What? It is all God’s light only,

222
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:58,440
what do we do? But by showing light to God, 
what we do is to, we worship light within

223
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:16,080
us. The light element gets enlightened within 
us. The light element is here on the Agnya.

224
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:26,009
When you do aarti, or when you put light before 
God, when you show light to God, the light

225
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:35,589
element within you gets enlightened. When 
you give flowers, Mooladhara gets enlightened.

226
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:46,779
When you get honey, then your attention gets 
enlightened. So, why we give it to God, after

227
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:52,129
all God doesn’t need anything. But God is 
the enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer, you

228
00:28:52,129 --> 00:29:02,629
cannot enjoy. Enjoyer is God. In you, when 
God is there that enjoys, that is the Spirit.

229
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:12,219
So whatever pleases your Spirit is used in 
the puja to be given. Now you give rice – all

230
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:18,219
these things are discovered – that you give 
rice to the Devi. Rice should be put in Her

231
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:28,019
lap. Now what is rice, a little rice to a 
Devi? Is, by putting rice, in you the satisfaction

232
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:40,099
of getting food or food that gives you satisfaction 
is enlightened. But that doesn’t mean you

233
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:45,549
start showering things on Me, that doesn’t 
mean that. What I am trying to say, do it

234
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:52,269
with dignity and understanding. That you give 
Me rice. Now, rice giving – these people

235
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:59,029
don’t understand why rice is to be given 
to God? After all, why give Him palm leaves?

236
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:06,369
What is He going to do? If Christ was the 
Son of God. What was the use of putting palm

237
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:20,489
leaves for Him? Or to give Him oil, oil bath 
or to rub His feet with oil? It is for you

238
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:25,210
to get the advantage. Now in Sahaj yoga it 
is proved now. When you rub My feet, you feel

239
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:32,210
better, not Me. You rub My hands, you feel 
better. When you fall at My feet, you feel

240
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,320
better. She, she is a great – what was, 
what is, what were you doing? Lady: Reflexology.

241
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,940
Shri Mataji: Reflexology. Big name, ah? Reflexology. 
And she is supposed to know about the feet

242
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,109
and things like that.

243
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:48,839
One day she said, “Mother I want to come 
and massage Your feet. I know this and all

244
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,129
that.”

245
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:54,519
So I said, “All right, come along.” So 
she came to rub My feet. Instead of I feeling,

246
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,999
becoming relaxed, she was becoming relaxed. 
The more she was rubbing she was getting relaxed.

247
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:09,869
So you see when you do for God, the blessings 
comes to you. You are blessed. Whatever is

248
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:20,039
the problem with you, you give to God to solve. 
Also whatever satisfies you, you give to God.

249
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,129
The satisfaction comes to you.

250
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:30,019
Now, these flowers when you give it to Me, 
Mooladhara. They give you two things, Swadishthana

251
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:34,899
and Mooladhara. Flowers that’s why are very 
important. They give Swadishthana, if the

252
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:42,089
flowers are beautiful, then they give Swadishthana 
and if they are fragrant they cure your Mooladhara.

253
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:50,950
Now, I mean there is no end to flowers also. 
But think about it, that you are doing it

254
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:56,080
to improve your chakras.

255
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:08,190
Then other things that are used like say ghee. 
Ghee is used. It is for Vishuddhi. Shri Krishna

256
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:14,559
is very fond of ghee and butter. So when you 
rub My feet with say butter, your Vishuddhi

257
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,099
will improve, you know that. Not Mine, I have 
no problem. I have only one problem that you

258
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:26,580
are within Me and when you have problem I 
have problems. Because these vibrations have

259
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,259
to go to you. So I prepare vibrations here 
as an antidote and they have to flow. It’s

260
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:36,580
a very subtle thing to understand.

261
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:45,339
To move from gross to Spirit, this is the 
thing by which you move, because first you

262
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:53,779
enlighten your chakras. By enlightening your 
chakras, your deities get happy, prasanna.

263
00:32:53,779 --> 00:33:01,419
By making the deities happy, you keep; get 
a passage for the Kundalini to pass through.

264
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:07,200
By making the passage for the Kundalini, the 
Kundalini goes up and then your attention

265
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,820
starts becoming one with the Spirit. It is 
step by step, you move from matter to subtler

266
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:22,989
matter, from subtler matter to your chakras, 
from chakras to deities, from deities to the

267
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:31,169
Spirit. Then Spirit enjoys itself. So there 
you do not have to do anything. Just give

268
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:32,599
your Spirit to Spirit.

269
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:41,229
That’s why these things were prescribed. 
Now people could not see this linkage. They

270
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:50,009
thought that, “Why should we give anything 
to God? After all it is all His own.” The

271
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:58,889
argument started. “Why should we put lights? 
There is no need.” But this is an escape.

272
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:05,749
Where are you, at what stage? You are at a 
stage; you are at a stage where you have to

273
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:16,079
detach yourself from matter. Same with Sahaj 
Yoga, I find it that you must understand the

274
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,970
complete vision of Sahaj Yoga. It’s a very 
big thing you are doing. You are not small.

275
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:32,139
You are doing a very great work, because it 
is “the” solution of all the humanity.

276
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,299
This is the solution of all the problems, 
whether political, economic or anything, whatever

277
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:36,659
you call it.

278
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:45,490
Is not only that but the more people you have, 
you will be surprised, I’ll work out much

279
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:51,299
better. Collectively I can cure cancer if 
you are more, if you are clear people. But

280
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:58,299
your channels are so full of problems that 
nothing flows through you. If you get yourself

281
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:07,029
cleared out, collectively I can stop cancer 
spreading, because if you spread more vibrations,

282
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:14,029
what happens that the left and right side 
in Virat becomes clearer and the attack from

283
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:19,309
the left and right side which creates cancer, 
all these horrible diseases, will be less.

284
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,019
Because there will be less.

285
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,630
But you do not understand your responsibility 
what you are doing. You are playing into the

286
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:34,529
hands of satanics. By not paying attention 
to your cleaning, by not paying attention

287
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:41,010
to your spiritual growth, you are not helping 
Me at all because these vibrations do not

288
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:47,500
flow out. They have to flow through you. If 
I could manage them there was no need for

289
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,440
Me to run after you. It has to flow through 
you, you are the channels and if you do not

290
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:01,640
keep yourself clean and humble and meek about 
it, it doesn’t work out. You are not helping

291
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:11,130
Me at all by that. So the localized problem 
of yours limited problems, should be given

292
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:19,779
up and see to the bigger problems that you’ll 
be solving. I can stop the happening of cancer

293
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:24,329
completely if I have twenty-one thousand Sahaja 
Yogis.

294
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:33,430
Completely, Cancer will go out of … leprosy 
I can control. Cancer already I am controlling,

295
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,730
but it’ll go down, collectively also. I 
mean the statistics I’ve not seen but will

296
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,660
go down.

297
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:46,769
It’s a left side attack and the more you 
try to go to left side there will be more

298
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:52,829
attacks. Right side attacks are also lots 
of these wars. All these wars and all these

299
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:57,410
things take place because we are invaded from 
the right side. All these aggressive people

300
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,789
like Hitler and all that are aggressing us.

301
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:11,930
How much it is necessary for you to rise above 
your lower self. One should understand that

302
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,880
and not to indulge into nonsense that you 
are doing. You have to really work hard for

303
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:26,609
that. Even if you have to get up early in 
the morning, you have to get up and do it.

304
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:31,539
You should understand your responsibilities, 
that’s the main point is. People are now

305
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:36,190
busy only doing jobs, working here, how much 
money you get, how much do you go, when do

306
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,599
you go to job and all that. That’s not important 
for us. Now that doesn’t mean you give up

307
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,769
your jobs and be a liability on the ashram, 
it doesn’t mean that! It means you do your

308
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,519
jobs, have money, money is needed for the 
work. I need money, you know that how much

309
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,920
money we need for all this work. You have 
taken such a big project of going to Europe

310
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,400
having this little money. It’s not possible. 
But we are doing it somehow. So, we need money,

311
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,309
you have to earn, you have to give; you have 
to give money.

312
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:11,319
Here people are, they are not even willing 
to give ten pounds. Such people. With them

313
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:20,809
where am I going to do Sahaj Yoga? We are 
so attached to money in a subtler way. We

314
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:27,029
do not understand we have to give money and 
we have to do it up. Not only money, money’s

315
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:32,190
not the only solution; we have to be ourselves 
channels. But then some people have money,

316
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:38,470
then they are exploited in a wrong way and 
the money’s all wasted. This is precious

317
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:46,150
money, this is auspicious money, this money 
goes into the right hands into right places.

318
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:54,690
Problems are created because of that. Now 
this money I do not need, you know that very

319
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,650
well. But for your own betterment you have 
to give money. Ask Gavin he’ll tell you.

320
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:08,010
He’s a very generous man and he, he found 
it very good. It’s not that I need a single

321
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:13,119
pai from you. On the contrary I am willing 
to spend My own money on things, you know

322
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,859
that definitely. But, you must understand 
this work has to be done, so you need money.

323
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,700
I need not tell you that you have to pay money. 
I have never said this to Indians, I have

324
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,029
never told them. They have never given Me 
a problem you’ll be amazed. How they solve

325
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,789
their problems God alone knows. They are not 
the people of money. There’s never a quarrel

326
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:34,420
about money. Nobody talks about money, nobody 
tells Me anything, nothing of the kind. Nobody

327
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:41,859
oppresses anyone or mishandles anyone or controls 
anyone, everybody does so well. Money is not

328
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:45,980
with one person. Say about two, three people 
handle it. Everybody knows how much money

329
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,569
they are taking.

330
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:56,170
This one part is important. For solving this 
problem you give Me rice. It’s called as

331
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:03,819
“Oti bharne,” that you give Me rice I 
beg of you, actually. You put it in My sari.

332
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:11,700
Rice, you give Me five times, I give you seven 
times back. That’s the symbol. You know

333
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:20,579
how symbols work out. Even when you say, “Mother 
are you the Holy Ghost?” it works out, it

334
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:28,109
gives you realization. If there is somebody 
so alert and sensitive sitting before you,

335
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:34,759
you must know how to do the symbols, how to 
do them properly, with full maturity, understanding,

336
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:43,200
in the proper way. You are very anxious to 
do the puja, but do you understand, before

337
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,680
the puja always there’s a quarrel going 
on. Somebody who is a very possessed person

338
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,369
will come, to begin with, and everybody will 
start fighting. Imagine! You must take your

339
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:59,529
bath, “What are you doing?”

340
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:06,950
In the morning don’t talk to anyone. Be 
in hush condition. You are in for opening

341
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:16,359
out to the great power, which is going to 
solve the problem of the world. So you cleanse

342
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:26,500
yourself, you wash yourself; you cleanse yourself, 
so that you get your chakras evolved. People

343
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:33,240
talked against it because they became only 
ritualistic, mechanical; matter became very

344
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,890
important. Then only doing these things became 
important. But not now, you people are different.

345
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:46,529
You are realized souls. That doesn’t mean 
that you should take to sanyasa or anything.

346
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:51,779
You should, I’ve told you, you should live 
like normal people, but a very dignified people.

347
00:41:51,779 --> 00:42:00,680
Nothing of indignity, childishness, superfluousness 
or joker-like, clown-like, outstandingly funny,

348
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,119
all these dresses should not be worn. You 
should be properly dressed in a way that you

349
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,220
have a presence. I mean this is to a children 
I am telling you. You must have a presence

350
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,309
of grown up Sahaja Yogis, You are all saints. 
You know such a lot even many saints do not

351
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,670
know. You can go and ask so many of them.

352
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:27,279
There’s one thing they know that I am that. 
That’s one thing you do not know. They know

353
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:33,549
that. This is a big difference. Because I 
am easily available to you, you do not understand.

354
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:38,829
For them I am great. As I told you yesterday 
that how these saints have recognized and

355
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:47,900
they have sent people to help Me. In saintliness 
only, your recognition of Me is poor. Because

356
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,009
if it was not, you would not be shouting in 
My presence, quarrelling in My presence. You

357
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:58,319
give Me headaches, you tell Me things, which 
you should not tell Me. “He knocked at my

358
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,029
door,” somebody tells Me. He says “he 
came there, he did this,” another tells

359
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:10,430
Me. You should not talk like this to Me.

360
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:17,700
You are materially again bound by talking. 
From where does the talk come from? Vishuddhi.

361
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:24,380
Talk comes from Vishuddhi, but it starts from, 
the whole vani, the whole sound starts from

362
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:37,349
much below. So, to raise it higher there are 
stages of this sound coming in. And when it

363
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:43,289
becomes madhyama, is in the heart, in the 
heart region where it just throbs, you do

364
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:54,700
not feel the throbbing. Then it comes here. 
Here it becomes vaikhari. Then it becomes

365
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:06,630
pashyanti means it sees, it just sees. Then 
it becomes Para, where it becomes just silent

366
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:21,130
in the aweness of the presence. We have to 
develop those things. But we do not understand

367
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:29,819
that all these things are our attributes, 
which we have to enlighten and rise. And make

368
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:41,539
every part, every petal of our being beautiful. 
If you start understanding these small, small

369
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:48,599
things, which are very important because I 
am talking of very big things. But even a

370
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,589
small thing can close your eyes completely.

371
00:44:52,589 --> 00:45:02,799
It’s a very big vision I have, very big 
vision. And that vision can be done through

372
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:07,720
you people. You do not think that you are 
ordinary. Otherwise I would never have chosen

373
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,980
you. But you have no recognition of yourself 
also, as you have no recognition of Me. You

374
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:26,089
have to recognize yourselves and respect yourself. 
Do not respect material things, respect yourself

375
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:30,069
first of all and the matter within you. If 
[side 1 & 2 overlap in this paragraph] you

376
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:35,990
move that way I think you’ll understand 
better what I am saying.

377
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:46,200
The body of a human being is a temple of God. 
But this temple has to be enlightened and

378
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:55,500
has to be auspicious. You have to clear and 
clean your being completely so it’s a beautiful

379
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,109
temple for God to reside there.

380
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:06,539
But we deceive ourselves, you see? When I 
am talking, you listen to Me and you think

381
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:13,710
that “Oh, Mother talked very sweetly, beautifully,” 
finished. But nothing goes inside. Why? Because

382
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:20,640
of lethargy. Lethargy is a thing, which is 
a barrier. It doesn’t allow Me to go inside

383
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,970
you. It’s a barrier. It’s very sweet thing, 
which smiles, just you see thinking, “Oh,

384
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:32,230
Mother is saying something nice, it’s very 
great,” it gives you happiness and all that,

385
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:39,000
but it doesn’t go inside, you do not imbibe. 
And that’s why, try to put your attention

386
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,900
to yourself and feel your dignity and honor.

387
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:48,279
Feel your presence that you have to have a 
presence and when I tell to some people, they’ll

388
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:54,710
say, “I know, Mother, I know I do that.” 
Then why do you do it? That means you are

389
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,029
possessed. You are a possessed person that 
you know this is wrong, still you are doing

390
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:04,200
it. Then you are a possessed person. Then 
is better you beat yourself with shoes. But

391
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,680
that stage should go now, I don’t like you 
to beat yourself with shoes, I mean are you

392
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,049
that, that level? But the level is such still.

393
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:24,609
And your presence is the one that should give 
Prasannata, is the cheerfulness to others.

394
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:36,999
Others should feel cheerful in your company. 
A presence is something, which you can understand.

395
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:48,130
A presence has prudence. It understand how 
to behave in a particular thing. It is not

396
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:54,119
imprudent like it won’t rush to a thing. 
It won’t jump on to a thing. If somebody

397
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:00,410
is talking you just do not become absolutely 
dominating on that. When you talk, you do

398
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:06,769
not talk in a way that is dramatic or sort 
of theatrical; or neither you talk in a way

399
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:11,779
that is lunatic-like or something like that. 
Presence has its own balance in the center

400
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:18,640
and that presence must be maintained. Presence 
is very important and just see yourself: are

401
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,999
you having a presence? Some people are very 
good Sahaj Yogis, but they have no “go,”

402
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:35,230
they have no dash, at all. They receive things, 
they see things, they should have a dash.

403
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:42,980
They have to tell people, but in a way that 
is congenial, that is sweet, that is beautiful,

404
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:49,420
that works is the point. If it does not work, 
what’s the use?

405
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:55,599
Now again I am going for seventeen days. Really 
seventeen days I’ll be out. I miss you all

406
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:07,499
very much and I feel concerned so much, because 
you have to still grow quite a lot. I feel

407
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:20,369
that among you there is no understanding of 
collectivity. A very irritable people; you

408
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:26,329
get irritable with each other, how can you? 
You are all saints. You must respect each

409
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:35,819
other; you must love each other, talk sweetly 
to each other. You are all saints! A saint

410
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:41,499
meets another saint, how does he meet? Have 
you seen anytime, a real saint meeting another

411
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:53,210
real saint? You should see. You do not look 
like that. The first proof is this. Are you

412
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:57,410
really saints or not. He has gone to India, 
how they met you?

413
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,519
Yogi: Take really hold of me.

414
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:00,579
Shri Mataji: See?

415
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:02,339
Yogi: I couldn’t believe him …

416
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:07,730
Shri Mataji: How they meet each other! They’ll 
hug each other and they enjoy each other’s

417
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:13,039
company. They laugh at jokes and understand 
it is such a congenial thing. Nobody thinks,

418
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,079
“I am right.” Nobody thinks like that. 
Once you start thinking, “I am right and

419
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:23,309
that person is wrong.” “I am doing all 
right, he’s wrong,” finished. They enjoy

420
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:28,839
themselves so much just like one wave it moves, 
you see? They are all the time laughing, enjoying

421
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:37,980
you know, loudly. They help each other such 
a lot. It’s absolutely worth seeing that.

422
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:43,980
While we had only five or six people to begin 
with, in [INDIAN PLACE NAME, SOUNDS LIKE:

423
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:51,019
Nilambar,] from London. One better than the 
other. They are all fighting, quarrelling

424
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:58,549
and they used to come up to beating. Can you 
believe it? This was happening. So shameful

425
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:04,339
I tell you and everybody was coming and telling, 
“What sort of Sahaj Yogis you have got,

426
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:12,690
Mother? Are they Sahaj Yogis, really?” Arguing 
and doing this and doing that. All sorts of

427
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,499
things were on and they would not inform Me 
the whole of it, but part of it would come

428
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:29,819
to Me. I was so ashamed. Ask Malcolm. They 
used to, I mean they would break each other’s

429
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:39,999
heads there. This was the condition. Can you 
believe it? While you would never find any

430
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:46,089
Sahaj Yogis doing that, never, in India. I 
have not seen anyone. Anybody who tries to

431
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:51,249
be funny goes out, immediately out of circulation. 
There’s no group-forming, nobody fights

432
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:57,529
with anybody, nothing. And everybody was surprised 
how strange these people were, one better

433
00:51:57,529 --> 00:52:05,319
than the other. They were very irritable, 
hot-tempered, fighting and all that. They

434
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,359
were so surprised that how can there be.

435
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:17,859
Give you an example here of Chhaya, see. Despite, 
she’s quite shocked; but she doesn’t know

436
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:24,269
how to really beat things, meet. People are 
so criticizing, so this thing, but she’s

437
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:32,829
trying to keep the balance. She’ll be always 
at the back. She’s never in the forward,

438
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:35,660
when it comes to work she’ll be the first 
to do it. She takes up responsibilities. This

439
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:48,509
is what happened last time. It’s not only 
lethargy, it is worse than that. In lethargy,

440
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:54,700
you see it is a devil’s mind, and when you 
come out of lethargy you just come to blows.

441
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:02,119
But as it is in India, I’ve not seen people 
coming to blows, I really tell you. Very seldom

442
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:08,999
you’ll find people coming to blows. I mean, 
people never even talk loudly or in a temper,

443
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:15,700
never. Now normally people are very quiet 
type. Then Sahaj Yogis, Oh! You should see

444
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:24,079
how they enjoy. Oh! The girls and boys and 
every one, the way they enjoy. Love seeing

445
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,599
them. You must try to enjoy each other.

446
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,749
Now the worst thing that can happen to human 
beings is ego. Worst thing, possession is

447
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:40,490
better, at least you feel the pinch of it. 
But ego you never feel the pinch. It is you

448
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:46,920
never feel that there is ego in you and you 
think you are the most correct person, you

449
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,210
are the best person and the temper shows here 
in the nose. I can see the “haw-haw,”

450
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:57,930
nose coming up like that.

451
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:05,799
Such ego, such ego, and this ego Indians have 
also picked up from you. Those who have come

452
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:10,650
in contact with you, you see, as the dog when 
he comes in contact with human being learns

453
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,890
many things, in the same way Indians who have 
come in contact with you people have picked

454
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:27,359
up ego and we can see the difference. But 
in simple villages people try to be nice,

455
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:34,099
congenial, good. How – by understanding 
auspiciousness. An auspicious presence is

456
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:40,869
soothing, comforting, absorbing, beautiful.

457
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:51,499
And this, how do you develop? You should do 
little aarti to My photograph is a good idea.

458
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:56,680
Now when you do the aarti also, somebody is 
shouting at the top of his voice. He’s trying

459
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,910
to lead others. Then another trying to lead 
others, this should not be. There should be

460
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:10,440
some, homogeneous, I can make it out, there’s 
no rhythm. Sing in the same tone, same style,

461
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,180
try to make it one, one, concord should be 
there.

462
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,119
In a humble way, in joyous way that we all 
are singing, all our hearts are singing. All

463
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:26,619
of us are here to do it. So many of us are… 
feel that joy, we are so many.

464
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:35,180
And it has a very bad effect on others when 
they see you this way. I mean anybody would

465
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:48,230
be shocked. Why in India it is spreading, 
because they see that love between the people.

466
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:55,109
Now of our attention if you take it to the 
Spirit you’ll feel the collectivity. Attention

467
00:55:55,109 --> 00:56:01,220
should be, as I told you yesterday, find out 
how many times you have talked nicely to others

468
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:06,140
and how many times have you have been quarrelling. 
If somebody says even a harsh word just keep

469
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:12,319
quiet. Do not feel bad, it’s all right, 
it comes and goes.

470
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:18,690
Now some people are negative in the sense 
that they are on the left hand side and some

471
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:23,349
people are negative because they are on the 
right hand side. Sometimes these combinations

472
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:29,690
work very well. When a dominating man tries 
to dominate a left handed person, they are

473
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,630
great friends, nothing like it. Because one 
dominates and another takes the domination.

474
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,589
As soon as the left hand side person becomes 
little on the center or tries to come to the

475
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:47,619
right, the dominating ones starts clashing. 
Then they are the worst enemies of each other.

476
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:54,269
It happens like that, so be on the alert. 
Now a person who is on the negative on the

477
00:56:54,269 --> 00:57:02,749
left side, should try to come in the center 
and in the same way a person who is on the

478
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:05,150
right side should come to the center.

479
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:12,029
Now how do you do it? Which is the way we 
can do it? Let us see it. A person who is

480
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:20,079
very much on the right hand side should try 
to become friendly with the left hand side

481
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:27,069
and left hand side person should try to be 
friendly with the right hand side, supposing.

482
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:34,329
Let us start like this. So what is the give 
and take in this thing? The person who is

483
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:42,130
on the right hand side will be better organizer, 
may be, may not be. At least will be a better

484
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:51,609
orator or maybe a better sort of a leader, 
may be, may not be, you can’t say. He may

485
00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:57,450
be the one who will suggest things and who 
will bring out things, who will say “I’ll

486
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:03,329
do this; I’ll do–” sort of thing, maybe. 
The left hand person will be frightened but

487
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:12,559
will be humble, more loving, more affectionate. 
He’ll be much more at the command of others.

488
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,339
This one will be commanding and the other 
will be receiving the command. This will be

489
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:25,289
there. Now how do we solve the problem of 
this mixture, you see? The one who is very

490
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:35,759
much on the ego side should try to obey the 
person who is on the left hand side. And on

491
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:42,109
the left hand side should try to command more 
on the right hand side person and should be

492
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:45,190
accepted. They, it should be mutually understood, 
there should be a contract. “All right,

493
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,720
I am an ego oriented person and you are superego 
oriented, now let us do one thing. You try

494
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,710
to dominate me and I’ll try to obey you.” 
It will work out. It’s a psychological style.

495
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:03,690
You just work it out. Try somebody who is 
a left sided person to dominate you. But rather

496
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:08,279
difficult to get left sided people here. They 
are very few, because I believe some people

497
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:13,670
were left sided, but when it comes to ego 
they are worst than anybody else, you see?

498
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:21,249
So rather difficult, but you can have a person 
who is left sided and let ten/an? ego oriented

499
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:28,470
ask him to dominate. Till he develops his 
ego, he’s all right. If he develops ego

500
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:34,359
stop it. But with complete understanding, 
watching yourself, how you develop, how far

501
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:38,299
you go – a play should go on. Play with 
yourself.

502
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:42,349
But if you are identified with yourself that 
“I am always right, and nobody is right,”

503
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:47,480
nothing can work out. I can tell you this 
much. Because if you are perfect I need not

504
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:55,210
waste My words here. So the best way is to 
do this sort of a thing, “All right you

505
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:02,509
order and I’ll do. Come along let’s see 
what do you think? Let you organize and we’ll

506
01:00:02,509 --> 01:00:08,049
do it. You tell us how to do it.” So he 
will use your heart and you will use your

507
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:12,380
attention, it will work out very well. The 
combination will be good.

508
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:18,670
Let us decide to improve ourselves and not 
to feel bad about it. We have to improve a

509
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:28,309
lot and a lot and a lot, because the relationship 
between you seems to be so bad. It’s like

510
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:39,680
cancer – absolutely cancer. It is malignant. 
So try to see your ego and if it’s a…

511
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,730
now even people if you have told them that 
somebody says you should say “I’m sorry,”

512
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,450
they’ll not say like that. They’ll say 
sarca… “Aha, I am sorry,” or something

513
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:52,720
like that. They’ll say in a sarcastic way 
so that sorry also has no meaning. All right,

514
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:01,369
all right don’t say anything. This is not 
the way. You should say, “See yourself.

515
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:08,049
So this ego has come. Now please tell me something 
else, I’ll do it.”

516
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:17,880
Christ washed the feet of His disciples. Just 
think of that. And that’s what a sensible

517
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:25,519
Sahaj Yogi does. He washes the feet of another 
disciple. If you remember Aradhna, my granddaughter,

518
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:31,779
when you people came to My house. There were 
I think about eight or ten of them. She got

519
01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:37,489
a small bucket; she washed each and everybody’s 
feet. Every time she would take it back to

520
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:42,640
the bathroom throw it away, again fill it 
up bring it with great Spirit. She was five

521
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,359
years. She had not completed her five years 
and she would wash everybody’s feet, wipe

522
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:55,779
them, again put back. She did for everybody 
and then after that she came on My feet and

523
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:58,460
then she said “I’m not going to look at 
anybody, I’m going to run away now I have

524
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:05,539
done my job,” and she went away. Aradhna 
is of a very high quality Sahaj Yogini she

525
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:11,309
is, very high quality. But she thought that 
this is the best way of washing their feet

526
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:20,819
is showing the essence of collectivity. “Some 
part of me is not all right, let me clear

527
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:27,729
it.” For example if you think of Me and 
you, you will understand how much I work hard

528
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:34,229
on you. Why? Because I love you very much 
and you are My part and parcel. If you are

529
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:41,229
not all right I’m not going to be all right. 
If you consider then, you will never think

530
01:02:41,229 --> 01:02:47,680
somebody is lower than you. Is better to wash 
the feet of someone than to wash your own

531
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,839
feet, will be a good idea. Put down your ego 
every time.

532
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:59,229
Mohammad Sahib used this method. But best 
was used by Nanaka: He said, “Let all the

533
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:06,170
Sikhs do some seva.” They have to, as a 
punishment they have to do some seva. So,

534
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:12,309
what is a seva when there is a group? Somebody 
has to sit down. Even one guru, very big guru,

535
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:19,269
had to clean the shoes of all the people who 
came for the program. He was given polish,

536
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:24,259
brush and everything – very recently he 
was punished to clean the shoes of the people

537
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:29,670
who came round. He was supposed to wash their 
clothes, wash their things, as a punishment.

538
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:36,390
Anybody who is arrogant should do it. Anybody 
who quarrels or fights should do it. Anybody

539
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:43,529
who is blunt should do it. And it worked, 
it works. They are supposed to wash their

540
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:52,489
clothes, they are supposed to wash their feet, 
rub their feet, give them a massage and feel

541
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:53,309
better.

542
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:58,099
In India if you see, all the Sahaj Yogis are 
working on each other’s chakras. But here

543
01:03:58,099 --> 01:04:02,779
nobody will accept even that you have these 
chakras caught up. Have you seen that? Everyday

544
01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:07,329
they are working, cleaning everybody’s, 
they’ll say, “Baba, clean my chakra,”

545
01:04:07,329 --> 01:04:12,210
they’ll say. Then when they do it they say 
“Thank you, you’ve cleaned mine.” And

546
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,249
then they helped them, they rub their hands, 
feet because you have done so much work for

547
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:26,960
them. This is not done here. I would like 
to see more mutual understanding, mutual love,

548
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:34,279
mutual attraction for each other, should look 
forward to each other. Try to help each other

549
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:41,200
than to criticize. I hate to hear any criticism 
of anyone from any one of you. But when it

550
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,849
gets, goes too much is better to tell Me.

551
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:49,859
But you must judge yourself, “What are we 
doing for others?” Some people think, “As

552
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:55,410
long as we keep quiet it’s all right.” 
It’s not the point. Try to be nice, give

553
01:04:55,410 --> 01:05:01,859
some presents, talk to them and there are 
so many ways of expression of your love to

554
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:08,200
them. Give sometimes flowers, try to find 
out what are the likes and dislikes of the

555
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,849
person is, is very good idea. Do not do things 
that people do not like, sometimes you see.

556
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:18,589
It’s better not to do it. What is the use? 
If the relationships are spoilt, not to do

557
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:22,029
those things. Just find out what you don’t 
like.

558
01:05:22,029 --> 01:05:29,359
A simple thing: my husband doesn’t like 
Me to put flowers in the hair. But in Maharashtra

559
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,650
all the married women are supposed to put 
the flowers in the hair, that’s a custom.

560
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:40,170
But because of I’ve married him, he doesn’t 
like because in their community, only bad

561
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:44,190
women put flowers in the head; I have never 
put flowers in My head. Only when it is a

562
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:52,479
special puja or they tie up – in Maharashtra, 
there I agree. But I never make a bun and

563
01:05:52,479 --> 01:05:56,900
put a thing. It’s all right, if he doesn’t 
like it why do it? Unnecessary to increase

564
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:05,019
all the clashes and the problem. Don’t do 
anything that people do not like you to do.

565
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:10,430
Try to avoid, it creates problems. Try to 
do something that pleases others.

566
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:15,789
Let us see if you have devised this method 
how to please. If you please others, your

567
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:20,930
deities will be very happy, because they are 
all one, within you, within her, within her,

568
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:27,609
they are all one. And they feel happy, because 
they’re all related to each other, and they

569
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:35,150
feel unhappy when you try to be unkind to 
each other, because they are one.

570
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:41,839
If this is worked out, properly, understandingly, 
all of you are going to be great saints. I

571
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,489
see your image in future also. Of some of 
you are going to be very, very great and some

572
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:55,190
of you are going to take it up. It’s a, 
it’s a project launched. Launch a project

573
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,160
against yourself, towards yourself, building 
up yourself. How sweet you are going to be

574
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,210
others, let’s have it. Talk to others. Some 
people just don’t talk, I have seen they

575
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:09,569
are all the time …[SILENCE]; they will have 
very bad Vishuddhi. You must talk; you must

576
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:13,569
be nice you must be open-hearted. This Yugoslav 
girl is very open–hearted, I like her for

577
01:07:13,569 --> 01:07:16,009
that reason. She has a big heart.

578
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:25,849
Talk with a big heart, open! No secretiveness 
and this cold, what is it called, English

579
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:26,569
manner?

580
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:28,009
Yogini: Aloof?

581
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:30,170
Shri Mataji: Aloof?

582
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:34,579
Yogini: When you keep yourself above people.

583
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:41,479
Shri Mataji laughs: Aloof. I think there must 
be some English special word for this thing.

584
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:44,460
The way they are cold you know. When you sit….

585
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,900
Other yogini: Stiff upper lip, Mother.

586
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,119
Shri Mataji: Ha?

587
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:51,150
Several yogis: Stiff upper lip … Upper lip.

588
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,609
Shri Mataji: Upper lip? Upper lip, not so 
much upper lip. There need not be upper lip,

589
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:54,109
could be pride.

590
01:07:54,109 --> 01:08:01,849
[Yogi’s laugh and one make an indistinct 
comment at which Shri Mataji laughs]

591
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:09,249
Shri Mataji: That kind of a presence is here, 
[INDISTINCT: DOUR,] which is specialty of

592
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:12,499
English also, isn’t it? You go in a train, 
they just don’t talk. I mean they don’t

593
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:19,710
allow you to talk, they freeze you with silence. 
They can’t see people laugh, smile or joke,

594
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:24,290
anything a …[SILENCE] and you don’t know 
what to do with them. Newspaper they will

595
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:28,109
read only all the way, and they will fold 
it and read it. But they know each and everything

596
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:28,279
about you.

597
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,540
Yogini: Could it be called “insular.”

598
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:42,920
Shri Mataji: Insular. Ah yes! And is a very 
dangerous thing for Sahaj Yogis. The one who

599
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:52,449
becomes insular is in for trouble. Is in for 
trouble, insular. You know why, because you

600
01:08:52,449 --> 01:09:01,339
are left alone, you’ll be attacked. Be together. 
All these bhoots also know you are insular.

601
01:09:01,339 --> 01:09:07,190
They’ll attack you. By any chance you try 
to become unique, they’ll attack you. Even

602
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:12,199
some people become, by talking too much also 
they can become insular, unique; you sit on

603
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:21,009
top of everybody else. Better be with everyone, 
is better. Be one with everybody, congenial.

604
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:26,310
Take a joke from others. Other are joking 
with you, you should not get angry. If somebody

605
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:32,940
joking with you, “Oh! Shut up.” Like that 
one should not do. Take a joke, be a sport.

606
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,190
English language has one very good quality 
that they can laugh at themselves, you see.

607
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:43,630
All the language has found out ways and methods 
of how to laugh at yourself, that’s something

608
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:50,339
beautiful about English language. I don’t 
think any language has so many words to express

609
01:09:50,339 --> 01:10:00,110
these odd situations, which are very, very 
embarrassing you see. You can only brand them

610
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:05,219
and by branding them, you know where you are. 
You exactly know what medicine is needed for

611
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:06,330
this. You see it is like that.

612
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:11,110
It’s just branding, “Oh this is it,” 
and it’s very interesting to watch these

613
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:16,360
things in the society and everywhere. Which 
is described, even Charles Dickens, now example,

614
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:21,570
at that time he found out these things and 
he said it. And I mean the description of

615
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:27,340
all these things is so beautifully done in 
the literature that you are amazed how people

616
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:33,699
had a capacity to see themselves, the society 
as it is and to de… Characterization of

617
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:38,420
people: how characters are built up you see 
and how it becomes a social problem. It’s

618
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:44,179
beautifully done and that’s the wisdom. 
That’s the real wisdom of British, I tell

619
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:50,190
you. I mean you may lose it if you start getting 
dominated by nonsensical ideas, but otherwise

620
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:54,989
that wisdom you have innate. I mean to have 
a person like Shakespeare itself shows what?

621
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:59,969
I mean you are a country of great people. 
How can that be? Where some, they are not

622
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:05,449
“some,” there are quite a lot of them 
and you are going to be the wisest because

623
01:11:05,449 --> 01:11:12,190
you have the advantage of their creation. 
On top of, you have got advantage of your

624
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:16,670
creation. Then/that? you belong to a great 
country like that. Imagine the whole country

625
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:26,760
is getting into the mire of lethargy, who 
is going to save this country? You people.

626
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:35,400
So again and again it is against lethargy 
and whatever is lethargy is anti Christ, is

627
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:49,820
anti God, is anti Mataji. Try to become cheerful 
and blissful, happy, dignified, sensible,

628
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:59,580
sweet. It’s not too many things, is very 
few, it’s only one. And I know we are going

629
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:06,000
to enjoy life very much. You are going to 
be very happy people. Take out your tempers

630
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,090
from your heads first of all, the angers you 
see and to say, “I got very angry.” Means

631
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:17,639
what? Why did you get angry? To be proud of 
your anger and temper and your irritations!

632
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:23,409
It will be very beautiful I am sure. You are 
growing up, but the growth becomes little

633
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:30,239
dwarfed with these nonsensical things, you 
know. So you have to protect your growth from

634
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:37,190
these things as we protect a small plant from 
say frost falling on a plant. It’s like

635
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:41,840
that. Frost is nothing compared to the plant, 
because plant is growing, but the frost can

636
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,110
kill it and that’s how you do not make it 
a frost. Be cheerful. People come up and they

637
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:50,909
go down. I’ve seen people come up and then 
they go down. Try to look after yourself.

638
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:54,070
[27:35 side B] [Extra 19 min on reviewers 
tape:] Now after seventeen days I am going

639
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,550
to come and see you very beautifully developed 
and all the time My attention is on you, I

640
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:08,050
work on you all the time. And I’m much more 
intimate with you than with anybody else,

641
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:12,960
because these people see Me only for two days 
and then they started crying! They’re lost.

642
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:19,659
But I see you so much, more than even Indians.

643
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:24,780
Is Paul there? Paul has come?

644
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,250
Yogi: Yes Mother.

645
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:32,310
Shri Mataji: Yes. Hm. Paul, what happened?

646
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:36,250
Paul: I want to get a message to, from the 
people of India…

647
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:36,830
Shri Mataji: Ha?

648
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:40,739
Paul: …Apart from the – the people of 
India send their love. But one of the Sahaj

649
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,139
Yogis in india has become very ill.

650
01:13:43,139 --> 01:13:44,159
Shri Mataji: Who?

651
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,219
Paul: Professor [INDISTINCT: Manneh] in Rahur.

652
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:47,929
Shri Mataji: I know. But why did you get angry 
with Dhumal?

653
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:48,699
Paul: Dhumal? By that time I’d really, I’d 
had enough of seeing in India the way that

654
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:53,070
there’s two classes of people in India: 
those who have a lot of money and those who–

655
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,489
Shri Mataji: And what about in this country?

656
01:13:55,489 --> 01:14:05,849
Paul: Well it’s the same deal in this country, 
but the people in this country who don’t

657
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:14,080
have a lot of money, at least they have bare 
necessities of life. You know like a roof

658
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,340
over their heads.

659
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,710
Shri Mataji: You went there to do Sahaj Yoga 
or to do these things? You see, what I’m

660
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:23,820
saying, where was your attention? Now you 
knows, Dhumal has given realizations to ten

661
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:32,580
thousand people. And he’s your elder brother, 
you should respect him. He has a servant,

662
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:37,170
because in India the situation is different. 
If he gives up his servant, he’ll have no

663
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,179
food to eat.

664
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:43,260
It’s not that everybody use brain. You see 
this is one thing in this country people do

665
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:48,780
not realize. If you use, you work much harder 
than his servant, do you know that? Because

666
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:56,000
your brain never stops. His servants works 
with his hand he doesn’t think! His energy

667
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,929
goes to his hands, he rests also. You see 
here the idea is if somebody’s working with

668
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:08,460
the hand, it’s cruelty. But what about this 
brain? The amount of brain you use all the

669
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,719
time – now tell me, you cannot stop your 
thinking, all right?

670
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:18,409
Now see My servant, though he works hard, 
he’s much more relaxed than My husband is.

671
01:15:18,409 --> 01:15:26,909
My husband doesn’t do even lifting a, say 
lifting a glass. All right? And what happens,

672
01:15:26,909 --> 01:15:31,020
that one can say that this man is a lazy fellow, 
he’s enjoying everything in life, he’s

673
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:36,869
enjoying all the comfort while the servant 
is not. But My servant is, in a way, is doing

674
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:41,060
his handwork, because that’s all he can 
do; his brain is not that developed. And he

675
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:49,210
has much more rest than My husband has. He’s 
much more relaxed. Somebody is the hand, somebody

676
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:54,880
is the feet and somebody’s the head. But 
if you do work with your head, is the same.

677
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,320
Now if you are doing work with your head, 
you have to have certain amount of comfort

678
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:04,159
to your body, otherwise even if you have to 
suffer on your body – of course I do not

679
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:11,880
say that servants should be ill-treated by 
any chance, that should not be done – but…

680
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,900
And nobody gives your money to anybody else 
like that. You see he’s paid for it and

681
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:21,199
he does the work with his hands so you can 
see it. But what about the brain part, do

682
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:28,429
you see the brain how it works? I wish you 
could have a microscope to see how the brain

683
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:34,650
works, and all the chakras, “cutcutcutcut-cutcutcutcut” 
going on. One thought itself is a dynamite

684
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:45,010
and you cannot stop it, ask him. Yesterday 
his thought going on like a machine! There’s

685
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,630
a machine here working out.

686
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:52,790
So, this happens and then one should understand 
that when you go to any country, you are a

687
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:58,150
guest there… He was very unhappy and he 
wrote a very sad letter to Me and that was

688
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,270
not good. You didn’t want him to be unhappy, 
you w–

689
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:00,340
Paul indistinctly: What if I write?

690
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:00,380
Shri Mataji: Ha? Dhumal?

691
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:00,639
Paul: We didn’t have an argument.

692
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:00,980
Shri Mataji: Ha?

693
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:01,659
Paul: I didn’t have an argument.

694
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:02,270
Shri Mataji: You didn’t have what?

695
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,110
Paul: I told him what I felt.

696
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,460
Shri Mataji: Ha?

697
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:07,099
Paul: I told him what I felt, I just went, 
I just… you know the most, quite a lot of

698
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:08,300
places in India. And–

699
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,210
Shri Mataji: You, what did you feel?

700
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:15,460
Paul: Well I felt that if somebody’s telling 
me how many houses they’ve got and how many

701
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,780
houses they’re buying, when their servant 
doesn’t have a roof over his head, when

702
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:25,159
the roof leaks and the children–

703
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:32,880
Shri Mataji: Now, supposing, here people have 
so many houses which are lying empty, here,

704
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:40,849
in England. Do they give their houses to you 
people? Do they? Is there any way? How many

705
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:44,280
people you should give also, is there any 
system by which you should give?

706
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,940
See that is not Dhumal’s problem, is the 
problem of the government. Dhumal has houses,

707
01:17:50,940 --> 01:18:00,790
he has given a huge big fort to us as a present 
to Sahaj Yoga. If he gives a house free to

708
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:05,070
his servant, I think he will make him a parasite 
out of him. Do you know in India, beggars

709
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:10,290
have got big, big buildings? Do you know that 
fact? Some of the buildings on Marine Drive

710
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:19,030
are owned by people who are professionally 
beggars. So if you see some problem it has

711
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:25,170
so many deeper roots, which you do not see. 
But, you just write a letter of apology to

712
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:32,099
him. I was hurt, very much, because he, he 
has done such a tremendous job.

713
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:40,239
He is going to give a huge big place to us 
for Sahaj Yoga. Nobody has been able to do

714
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:49,310
that so far. He has given Me ten thousand 
people as Sahaj Yogis. And when you people

715
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:58,780
say, “I felt,” what is this “I,” what 
is this “I”? I know you have a very sympathetic

716
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:05,630
heart, but sometimes you are swayed by it. 
Sympathetic heart, to a point is good. It

717
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,840
should be prudent heart, it should not be 
unwise. You must know the sense of proportion.

718
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:16,110
I mean that’s a system in India, which is 
working, but you cannot do without servants.

719
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:19,679
Here also. What is happening to you, without 
servants, you are all intelligent people,

720
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,610
why you live in a mess, in pigsties? Because 
you are using your brains, you don’t know

721
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:30,580
how to use your hands. All these communistic 
ideas are of no use. People have to do some

722
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:36,719
sort of a job, this job or that job. There’s 
nothing wrong. Some people who can do brain

723
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,699
job, have to do brain job, those who have 
to do handwork has to do handwork. Of course

724
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:44,980
there should not be much disparity in their 
living, I agree, but that’s not his problem,

725
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,090
is the problem of the whole country.

726
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:54,690
But I tell you even to servants I have seen, 
you give them something… There was a lady

727
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:59,880
nurse, you see? Once I was rather sick so 
she used to come and see Me and help Me a

728
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,830
little bit. So I thought just as a favor I 
must do something to her. So I sent her by

729
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:11,170
our ship to sea, I said “Let her have a 
holiday, she’ll be all right.” So I sent

730
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:15,940
her to Africa. I mean the problems are much 
deeper than you understand. I sent her to

731
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:21,010
Africa. You know, she came back and she started 
telling the doctor off. She thought she has

732
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,070
become the doctor.

733
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:26,679
And the doctor told Me, “Why did you do 
it?” They get into imbalances. You see,

734
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:31,900
even to poor persons, if you give them something 
like that, they go into imbalances.

735
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:38,969
I’ll give you another very concrete example. 
My husband, who is very socialistic in his

736
01:20:38,969 --> 01:20:44,119
approach, and is a good thing, so what he 
did, was to increase the pay of the drivers.

737
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:48,429
You see the drivers started getting one thousand 
Rupee, which was very, very big amount. And

738
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:53,110
the lowest clerk gets about say twelve hundred. 
So there was a very little disparity. Now

739
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:59,199
the driver’s getting one thousand Rupees, 
was too much. Within six months their wives

740
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:04,449
came to Me. They said, “This was a very 
wrong thing he did to our husbands. They have

741
01:21:04,449 --> 01:21:10,550
got keeps now; they have started drinking; 
they have started not giving any money to

742
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:15,730
us.” So to poor people if you give them 
more money, they do not know how to use it,

743
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:22,400
they will be drinking. Poor people drink much 
more than the rich people. So they had to

744
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:31,630
be trained how to use money. You just give 
them money is no use. You do not understand

745
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:35,400
the deeper… thing… People are to be brought 
up properly.

746
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,849
Like we have got in India Schedule Caste – I 
agree Schedule Caste is a nonsense, it should

747
01:21:39,849 --> 01:21:44,980
not be there, you should not treat somebody 
as a lower caste, is all right. But what they

748
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:50,949
have brought into now, suddenly, that Schedule 
Caste must have equal seats, equal rights

749
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:55,400
in every job and everything, whether they 
are qualified or not. So you have got people

750
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:01,570
who are not qualified, or even in exams, in 
the colleges, you must have so many Schedule

751
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:02,099
Caste.

752
01:22:02,099 --> 01:22:08,290
Now what has happened, by doing this kind 
of a top-heavy work, some muck has come up,

753
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:13,719
and they are absolutely useless people, they 
cannot do administration. Instead of that,

754
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:19,130
what Ghandiji had said, that, “Train them 
up, educate them, bring them up.” Suddenly

755
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:24,949
the educated people are there and some people 
suddenly, uneducated, nothing, brought to

756
01:22:24,949 --> 01:22:28,810
that, they cannot bear it.

757
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:36,289
Now we had a servant with us who came to Me, 
who was a – you must be knowing him, Paramshivam

758
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:42,360
– who came down here. And he used to, he 
was getting hardly hundred Rupees there, we

759
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:49,730
gave him a big pay and everything, when he 
came here he started misbehaving. Then his

760
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:53,010
mother, when I wrote to them that, “He’s 
misbehaving, I don’t know what to do. He

761
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:59,020
has developed all bad habits.” He was buying 
pornography pictures here, going to the pub,

762
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:03,960
then having girlfriends and doing all sorts 
of things, he started here. So when I wrote

763
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,550
to his mother, what his mother wrote to Me 
is very interesting to read. She said, “Those

764
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:20,679
people who live in mud, if they have to sleep 
on a bed, it hurts them. So suddenly giving

765
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:27,719
them something materially is not going to 
improve him. You have to train them up. You

766
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:37,570
do not know what problems there are of poverty. 
Poverty is just like leprosy. Leprosy: you

767
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:43,650
know what the leprosy parasites eat? They 
eat petrol; they thrive on petrol. So gross

768
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:53,139
it is.

769
01:23:53,139 --> 01:23:58,320
And then, you being an Englishman should not 
have said it, because English are responsible

770
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:06,510
for the poverty of India, you like it or not. 
They have created this problem for us, we

771
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:11,400
didn’t have this problem before. Our servants 
were part and parcel of our house. They treated

772
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:16,030
us just like slaves, so we have got this idea 
from them.

773
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:22,849
How they treated us! I must say Dhumal was 
very decent not to say this to you, but this

774
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:30,170
is what it is. The way they treated us in 
India, you have no idea. Even till yesterday

775
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:37,290
we had “White Clubs” where Indians were 
not allowed on our own soil! When we were

776
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:39,710
independent, and they’re fighting for it.

777
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:47,380
They killed thousands of people, raped so 
many woman there. “We English” should

778
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:53,300
not say that, in that country were we have 
ruled and made them slaves. You see they did

779
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:58,030
not allow us to come up. What are you doing 
to foreigners here who are coming up? How

780
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:05,020
you treat them? What racialism you have here 
compared to what we have in India, we have

781
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,380
no racialism. They treated you with such great 
respect. They should have said, “You are

782
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:14,730
white, so ‘racialism,’ all right we’ll 
ill-treat you.” But if you go to Africa

783
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:20,449
they will teach you. Africans, West Indies 
– they are on top of you. What I’m saying,

784
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:25,929
to break the vicious circle try to understand 
the problem of every country. From where does

785
01:25:25,929 --> 01:25:31,159
this problem come to India, and to most of 
the countries who are underdeveloped. The

786
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:43,840
French, they dominated also many countries. 
This is also, one should understand that we

787
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:55,710
should not dominate any more. We should wash 
their feet, that’s what it is.

788
01:25:55,710 --> 01:26:01,130
Now you have killed the culture of all the 
Africans and Africans have taken to all French

789
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:05,730
and English culture. Absolutely, they have 
prostitutes the same way you have, they have

790
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:09,310
the women the same way you have; their ideas 
of liberation’s the same, only the Indians

791
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:16,199
have resisted you. Otherwise everywhere you 
have never respected anybody’s culture or

792
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:27,239
anything. You have to face it. If you go to 
South America, you’ll be shocked the way

793
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:33,000
people have wiped out all the… all the people 
who lived there; all of them, one and all.

794
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:44,030
Except for Columbia, can you imagine? Every 
country, every soul has been wiped out. Just

795
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:48,739
see that.

796
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:56,260
Of course if he was ill-treating him I can 
understand, but he doesn’t ill-treat. These

797
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:02,010
ideas are Western ideas; they’re applicable 
to you people, not to Indians. And this is

798
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:09,159
the big mistake people are doing is to put 
your ideas onto us. For example in field reforms,

799
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:13,560
you see? My son-in-law is a very enlightened 
fellow, he had twenty-five miles, square miles

800
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:19,949
of area of his own. But he used to get his 
labor from all these areas, he used to provide

801
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:24,320
them everything, he used to pay them very 
well; they were living very well. Suddenly

802
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,780
the idea came, “No. They must have their 
own land holdings,” all right – without

803
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:33,500
understanding that they are to be trained, 
they are to be brought up, they are not educated,

804
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,320
there must be communication – so everybody 
was given a one patch here and a one patch

805
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:42,449
there and a one patch there and a one patch 
there. What happened, that they started getting

806
01:27:42,449 --> 01:27:47,599
strangulated in those areas. There was no 
way of communication to them, they could not

807
01:27:47,599 --> 01:27:53,250
get their wheat, they could not get their 
seeds, they could not do anything, they started

808
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:57,429
starving. And they came to My son-in-law that, 
“You come forward, you are the one who was

809
01:27:57,429 --> 01:28:02,239
the agency in between and you should have 
done it.” But they removed the agency and

810
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,650
without training these people.

811
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:12,000
Ghandiji suggested these things. He said that, 
“You must enlighten the rich people and

812
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,610
you must also try to emancipate these people 
by education, by making them understanding,”

813
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:28,230
and all that. There is a huge, areas in India, 
which are called as “Backward Areas,”

814
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:33,869
where these aboriginals live. They do not 
believe in any sedentary habits, they are

815
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:40,210
like, what you call the gypsies. So what they 
do, these people plough their fields and all

816
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:46,739
that, and they come in the night and plunder 
it. And they live like that. And they have

817
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:52,960
been living like this and they feel very happy 
about it. They second is this (?), the so-called

818
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:59,730
poor of India. You must see how leprosy grows 
also. They started in Maharashtra a scheme

819
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:06,460
by which they said, “We will provide you 
jobs and otherwise we’ll give you a dole.”

820
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:10,719
Now this is the worst thing that can happen 
to anyone; that we have realized very soon,

821
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,960
I hope they have withdrawn it. So they what 
they did – Indians as it is they are very

822
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,380
cunning and clever – so what they did they 
would go and write their names as the people

823
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:23,849
who are doles, getting doles, you see? And 
they would work somewhere and get the dole

824
01:29:23,849 --> 01:29:32,920
as well, double money. Then they would go 
and drink. What are these people doing, but

825
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:42,320
to drink? It’s such a problem, prohibition; 
they, they drink iodine, they drink, what

826
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,340
you call this… What do you eat, drink for 
this thing, it’s some sort of sulphuric

827
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:49,929
acid or some sort of an acid they drink? I 
don’t know?

828
01:29:49,929 --> 01:29:51,790
Various yogis: Meths… Methylated Spirits.

829
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:58,929
Shri Mataji: Methylated or whatever… [laughs] 
I don’t know! I don’t understand. So,

830
01:29:58,929 --> 01:30:04,369
you see they are so foolish, what I am saying 
that taking up anything like that at random

831
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:07,840
is not good. 
And I was sorry because his wife wrote to

832
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,420
Me, “How much they have done for Sahaj Yoga.” 
The only solution is Sahaj Yoga. There’s

833
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:17,719
no other solution, which he has helped Me 
a lot.

834
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:22,260
“You see,” and he was very sorry he said 
that, “How am I to do without servants?”

835
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:28,170
You see the servant system is like that. If 
he gives roof to everyone he’ll be left

836
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:32,090
with no house. There’s not done, this kind 
of generosity’s not done anywhere. If there

837
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:37,989
was such an agency like that, which was doing 
such a work, it is possible.

838
01:30:37,989 --> 01:30:42,670
Even the so called communists everywhere, 
wherever they are in a democracy, have their

839
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:51,560
own properties. Once the democracy will go 
away they won’t be able to even talk.

840
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:56,400
But I do not say that Capitalism is the solution; 
I say Sahaj Yoga is the solution, all right?

841
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:02,159
It is the Sahaj Yoga and he’s done so much 
for Sahaj Yoga. For that servant we cannot

842
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:08,780
in any way insult him; servant is not important 
for us, who is the servant? Who are these

843
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:16,829
poor people to us? We are not responsible 
for them, the state is responsible. We are

844
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:22,849
responsible for Sahaj Yogis, because they 
are the people who make the difference.
