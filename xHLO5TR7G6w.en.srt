1
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:22,843
I’ve been desiring all the time that
I should go to Turkey or Tunisia

2
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:28,161
where there could be an entry into
the Islamic world,

3
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:42,477
because they have been promised that
they will be resurrected,

4
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:47,231
and that resurrection has to take place.

5
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:50,505
For that I have to venture

6
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:56,166
and give them their resurrection which is
promised by Mohammed Sahib,

7
00:02:56,367 --> 00:03:02,125
I mean that’s My duty; and not only duty,
but I’m bound by it,

8
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:07,258
that I have to tell them about their
resurrection and to save them.

9
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,687
They deserve it, no doubt.

10
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:19,904
When all the religions prospered

11
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,009
in a very funny manner, I would say,
separately,

12
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,905
everyone thinking they are the best,
the chosen ones,

13
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:33,822
the highest ones, the greatest ones,
believing in themselves,

14
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:40,107
they started going down and down and down.

15
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:49,307
The reason is, you see, there is no respect
for each other.

16
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:57,636
And the respect is not there because
there is no respect for oneself.

17
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,209
If you respect yourself, you respect others
also.

18
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,706
But when you have no respect for yourself,
you cannot respect others;

19
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,173
but you should bombastically say that,

20
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,998
“I’m this, I’m that, I’m that” –
any religion.

21
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,889
Then your ego works,

22
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:26,720
and ego makes you a person who does not
know about yourself.

23
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:34,408
If somebody has respect for oneself,
he will never push forward,

24
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:44,115
 he will never try to be something
prominent, he’ll never try to show off.

25
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:54,586
On the contrary such a person would be
hesitant to do something

26
00:04:54,787 --> 00:05:01,579
out of the way, something arbitrary,

27
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:11,806
something showy, because it is absurd,
and it is stupid.

28
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:19,171
So to do something stupid is a sign of ego,

29
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:25,576
absolutely ego makes you stupid, and
ultimately with it you become idiotic.

30
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:33,718
So the respect for oneself has to be
developed and as Sahaja Yogis

31
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,357
you have to respect yourself: “We are
Sahaja Yogis, so how can we do like that?”

32
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:45,707
As I told you that if you teach your
children all the time that,

33
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,872
“You are Sahaja Yogis, you are something
exceptional”,

34
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:54,232
then they will have respect for themselves,
self-respect.

35
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,248
Is a very good word, “self-respect”,

36
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,166
I don’t know how many people know about it.
Only when they are insulted or troubled

37
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,623
they think of their self-respect, otherwise
they go amok

38
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:08,852
and behave in such a manner that as if
they have no self-respect of any kind.

39
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:14,977
So as Sahaja Yogis we have to have
self-respect.

40
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:21,978
And when we have to have Sahaja Yoga
as our manifestation,

41
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:31,160
as our personality, as Yogis, we have
to have a sense of self-respect.

42
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:34,867
And even now you can find on the periphery
you find many people

43
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:40,624
who lack self-respect and understanding.

44
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:48,009
Some people are still sort of parasitic.

45
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,254
Some people hang on to things when they
are told not to hang on,

46
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,503
to take it easy, to work it out, they
try to assert,

47
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:02,085
“No, we’ll be there, we are going to be
there, we are going to fight it out.”

48
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:06,211
That’s not for a self-respecting person;

49
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,575
it’s a foolish thing to do.

50
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:18,270
Like two persons were going, one up
on the staircase, another coming down.

51
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:23,543
So the one who was going up in his ego,
he says,

52
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:27,787
“You better move; I don’t move for fools.”

53
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:33,107
So the another one says, “I do”
and he moved.

54
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:41,533
So this is what is the sign of a sensible,
wise, self-respecting person.

55
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:49,044
He doesn’t go into fights, he doesn’t go
into unnecessary discussions

56
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:57,307
and arguments and assertiveness, but
he sees – “Wait, is it worth it?”

57
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:00,357
But when it comes to protection of truth,

58
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:06,958
he stands up and he can find lot of courage
for the truth.

59
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,404
I think self-respect is the first beginning
for Sahaja Yoga,

60
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:15,066
is to develop self-respect in their inner
being

61
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:20,119
as well as in their manifestation.

62
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:25,586
It shows very well in protocol also,

63
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:31,471
like I’ve seen people who - supposing
I have to go to Brighton,

64
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:35,702
“Mother is going, all right, we’ll go
in Her car.”

65
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:41,132
If it was for My love, that’s different;

66
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,830
but just to save some money, “Let’s just
jump into the car”.

67
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,023
That’s not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

68
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:55,171
Then it is also in power, when they have
to express their power, you see.

69
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,889
Like the other day one girl came to Me,

70
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,711
she had given realization, she was
all right.

71
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:05,349
Second day she came, “Mother, I lost
my vibrations.”

72
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,401
I said, “Why, what happened? With whom
were you talking?”

73
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:12,140
So she told Me the name of a lady who
was asked

74
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:19,756
to get out of Sahaja Yoga, Alice, and
she talked to Alice.

75
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:22,071
This Alice was allowed to come
to the program

76
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,900
but she took over as if she is a great
Sahaja Yogini

77
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:28,698
explaining Sahaja Yoga to this lady and
finished her vibrations.

78
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:34,863
Now this lady is such an important thing
because she was going to Florida.

79
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:39,661
If she is just allowed to come in
the program she thinks

80
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,163
she is now a very big Sahaja Yogini and
she can talk to anyone

81
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:48,326
whatever she wants to, and spoil
the vibrations of another person.

82
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:52,636
If I’ve appointed somebody as a leader,
it is not on the basis of their looks

83
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:58,834
or education or anything, but on their
vibrations and their dedication.

84
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:05,357
So the Sahaja Yogis have to seriously think
about it.

85
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:08,485
Such people are always around to show off
their knowledge.

86
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:12,884
You see, in Sahaja Yoga is so easy,
the knowledge part of it, it’s very easy.

87
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:18,155
Anybody who is intelligent enough can read:
this is the chakras, this is this,

88
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:26,322
they can give big lectures, explain this
deity sits on this chakra. It’s so simple.

89
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:39,294
But the compassion and knowledge,
hand in hand, makes a Sahaja Yogi.

90
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:43,966
Now some people have another style,
is of compassion.

91
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,653
Naturally compassion is always sympathy,
as I told you,

92
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:53,065
except when it is with knowledge is
all right.

93
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:56,449
But just compassion -

94
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:02,097
with compassion they will always sympathize
with all the bhootish people.

95
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:06,413
If there’s one bhootish person in Sahaja
Yoga, he’ll bring ten more on Me,

96
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:12,248
“Mother, look after this person, look after
this person, look after that person.”

97
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,022
Firstly because that person was damaged

98
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:22,023
and secondly because that damaged
personality thinks that,

99
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,829
“Another is damaged, let us save this
damaged person.”

100
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,073
All right, if it is so, first of all you
should be all right,

101
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:35,342
and tell that person to “work on yourself”,
because if you try to help that person,

102
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:39,621
your negativity will increase. You’ll go
from bad to worse.

103
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:47,843
Always sympathies will go to a person
who is not all right, we should say.

104
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:51,537
So you tell such a person, “All right,
you work it out this way,

105
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:55,378
but I have nothing to do with you”,
or send that person

106
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:00,215
to somebody who is an egoistical,
so they share better.

107
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:04,403
There’s complimentary between the two,
and it works out better

108
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:09,079
and saves Me a little worry.

109
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:14,667
But beyond all this the combination
of these two

110
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,813
actually must emit vibrations.

111
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:26,297
It is how many vibrations you have within
yourself is the point which one should see.

112
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:30,982
First the vibrations when they are,

113
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:36,070
how are we to know we are all right
as far as vibrations are concerned?

114
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:46,057
What is the sign of being a good Sahaja
Yogi, or we are really Sahaja Yogi,

115
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:52,413
is that we develop a kind of a detachment.

116
00:12:55,668 --> 00:13:00,667
First the detachment comes naturally
because you are away from your body,

117
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:06,771
so you are not bothered about your body,
you don’t think about it.

118
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:10,115
That doesn’t mean you do not look after it.

119
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:14,574
It doesn’t mean that you don’t have
any sense of how you look

120
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:19,799
and how you move about, because you
have to be decently dressed also.

121
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,600
But attachment means that all the time
thinking,

122
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:27,482
“This chakra is catching, that chakra
is catching,

123
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:33,321
my head is catching, my Agnya is catching,
this is happening.”

124
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:39,764
This is the subtler way how Sahaja Yoga
can ruin you, is this all the time thinking,

125
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,031
“This is wrong, this is wrong”, condemning
yourself.

126
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:46,447
So this detachment has to be there about
yourself,

127
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:50,706
“No, doesn’t matter, so what, I’m like
a barometer.

128
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:53,518
If I go near somebody and if I catch
well and good, you see,

129
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:56,272
I’m just helping that person, well
and good.”

130
00:13:56,473 --> 00:14:01,470
Or you give yourself a bandhan and just
approach somebody.

131
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:06,736
So worrying too much about your chakras
is not a very good thing

132
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:12,595
for the progress of Sahaja Yoga. On the
contrary, you should try to meditate,

133
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:17,988
don’t think of individual chakras, just
meditate with your heart.

134
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:25,110
So now you will see from My lecture,
or whatever you call this,

135
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:32,374
is that you have to have a heart which
is open to Sahaja Yoga.

136
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:37,364
When your heart is open, first of all
you forgive yourself

137
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:41,553
and you forgive others, and you don’t see
to your individual chakras

138
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:46,965
or bother about others, in the way that
you are concerned

139
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:53,004
about one individual, but you look
at the whole as a whole.

140
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:57,848
You will then start talking about Sahaja
Yoga – “How is Sahaja Yoga spreading,

141
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:01,104
how many people are getting realization,

142
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:05,269
how much responsibility I have done,
I should”.

143
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,914
“I have done” means not ego out of it, but,

144
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:12,990
“I should do? What work can I do here?

145
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:19,553
What mistakes we Sahaja Yogis have
committed that it has not worked out?

146
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:25,050
What is the situation? How I can help?”.

147
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,918
This kind of a, you see, sort of as if,

148
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:31,774
like you really become a light and you
want to give light.

149
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,379
So what’s wrong with the lamp which
is not giving light?

150
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:42,649
But you don’t think about yourself, you
think as a body, the whole thing.

151
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:49,093
This is the first thing is to open
your heart.

152
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:58,887
As soon as you open your heart you will
widen yourself, you’ll grow.

153
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:08,079
For that you need not condemn yourself but
opening your heart is – look at this ocean,

154
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:14,202
how it is touching all the shores but it is
in itself, in its own maryadas.

155
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:18,495
If you try to press the ocean from any side
it will show on the other side.

156
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:23,034
You cannot press it. It has its height,
it has its limitations,

157
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:26,244
it stays in its own limitations.

158
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,515
So open-hearted person is like this,
it touches every shore

159
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:34,446
but keeps to itself, to its own maryadas.

160
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:39,683
So this understanding if it comes,
the expansion also is in such a manner

161
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:43,524
that you do not go into individual corners
and individual places,

162
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:49,460
but you keep to yourself and you touch
everyone.

163
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,881
This is the opening of the heart when
we say.

164
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:03,289
Then a Sahaja Yogi will have automatically
a proper discretion,

165
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:11,591
discretion how far to say, how far not
to say, how far to go, how far to behave.

166
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,097
Immediately you can find out a Sahaja Yogi
who tries to show off

167
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:19,459
and wants to talk about something they
don’t know

168
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,481
and gets hold of ten people around you
and talk about Sahaja Yoga.

169
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:32,402
Anybody who sits round like that, never go
near that person.

170
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,077
I discovered a horrible woman in England
who used to do that.

171
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:48,260
And then she formed a group against
the whole system,

172
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:58,032
but she caught hold of the leader itself and
all of them had to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

173
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:07,816
So one has to understand that we have
to be simple people,

174
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:13,522
not complicated. For that heart has to be
open –

175
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:17,402
that’s all I can say, open your heart.

176
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:22,070
Not, it’s not imaginary, it is a state
I think,

177
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:31,139
in which you have to be stationed to be
self-satisfied.

178
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:36,437
This is a very good way of approaching
Sahaja Yoga

179
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:40,409
for yourself and for others.

180
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:47,257
If you want Me to say – rather
embarrassing –

181
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:51,215
but if you put Me in your heart, heart has
to increase

182
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:57,196
because of My size, you see.
You can’t help it.

183
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:03,403
It has to grow.

184
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,176
So that’s the best, easiest way to do it,
you see?

185
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:11,061
You are such lucky Sahaja Yogis that
I’m there with you.

186
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:13,770
You don’t have to do anything. Put Me
in your heart, finished.

187
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:17,893
You are all right now, no problem.

188
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:27,249
Not that “I love you, Mother”, but is
the point is,

189
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,847
“I put you in my heart.”

190
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:40,936
But don’t ever think like this: “Mother 
loves me, because I can cook for Mother,

191
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:46,048
because I can look after Her sari, I can
press Her sari” - then it’s ego.

192
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,775
The other way round becomes immediately
ego, I tell you.

193
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:56,775
I didn’t know but there are instances of
this kind. Immediately it becomes an ego.

194
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:02,188
But if you say, “How much I love Mother” -
just admire yourself -

195
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:06,361
“Oh, I love Mother so much.”

196
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:15,117
And you’ll feel very fine within your
heart, as so joy-giving.

197
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:22,587
Imagine people who never had Me with them,
who came on this earth,

198
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,006
had to fight for dharma, had to fight
for righteousness

199
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:31,216
and for truth, how they must have fought.

200
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:38,534
But I am before you, so it is, “How much
I love my Mother”.

201
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:47,090
Is a very simple method, a basic method
for every Sahaja Yogi

202
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,561
to discover oneself, and to develop
oneself.

203
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:08,707
Then the discretion, the light, everything
just starts emitting.

204
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:14,748
You see yourself in that light and you walk
in that light

205
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,679
and people see that you have light.

206
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:27,474
Now you are convinced about Me. You have
seen

207
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:32,517
photographs, you have seen the sun,
the reaction, everything you have seen it.

208
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:38,898
So now that you can love such a person,

209
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:50,994
itself is a very big boon for us that we
love Mother.

210
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:57,722
Even if you think that I have not yet said
“hello” to you,

211
00:21:57,923 --> 00:22:02,377
or sometimes I may not look at you – maybe.

212
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:07,145
But it’s not Me – it’s you.

213
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:11,562
I, in any case, love the whole world –
is no question!

214
00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:14,766
Nobody more, nobody less.

215
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,539
But how far you are closer to Me depends
on you, you see,

216
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:26,625
because I’m a fixed quantity. How far you
move towards Me is the point.

217
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:30,119
I’m a fixed quantity and sometimes people
are amazed that,

218
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,008
“Why Mother was not all right with us
this time?”

219
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:42,421
Actually, I stand wherever I am, but you
have moved away.

220
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:47,432
So all kinds of discretions start flowing
into you.

221
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:56,434
Even you are convinced that I’m
the Adi Shakti

222
00:22:56,635 --> 00:23:03,597
and there are so many convincing facts
that you have – photographs are there,

223
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:09,481
and all happenings are there, miracles,
everything, everything is there -

224
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:18,268
still you are floating, floating on these
ideas

225
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:26,577
that, “Oh, look at this, this is Mother’s
photograph, this is what has happened.”

226
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:29,365
Still you are floating.

227
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:36,453
If you really want to go deep down,

228
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,783
you have to just feel your heart.

229
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:46,035
There you’ll find the miracle.

230
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:50,562
These outside miracles are to push you in

231
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:55,646
and there you will grow, and grow in
a better way.

232
00:23:55,847 --> 00:24:01,758
That’s the only thing we have to find out
and discover.

233
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,326
This will really help Sahaja Yogis who are
new, you see,

234
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:10,218
when they will see how you love Mother.

235
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:17,296
Yesterday only we had parked our car
in a funny way perhaps, maybe,

236
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:22,700
and they were all about to quarrel
and fight Mr Guido.

237
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:25,443
They might have beaten him, beaten him
also,

238
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:27,007
but he said - “Why did you park here?”

239
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,303
He said, “It’s my Mother who has come,
I’ve parked it here

240
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:33,511
because my Mother can’t do this”, finished.

241
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:40,813
As it is anybody who loves his mother, as
it is, is regarded something very good.

242
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,510
Now the mother is horrid;

243
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:49,188
still if you tell them, “My mother is
horrid”, people won’t like it.

244
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:54,949
But you say that, “I love Adi Shakti.”

245
00:24:58,021 --> 00:25:02,441
[Shri Mataji: Who is it?
Yogi: Oh. Put him out.

246
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:05,418
Shri Mataji: Who is he?
Yogi 2: What does he?

247
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,232
Yogi: Mr Mauro (?) from Switzerland,
Shri Mataji.

248
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,770
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

249
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:12,149
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Mr Mauro from Switzerland.

250
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,056
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogis: Switzerland…

251
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:22,554
Yogi: They came without asking.

252
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:26,423
Shri Mataji: Put your hand on his heart,
doctor.

253
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:32,269
See, this is how we help. He didn’t
understand what I was talking.

254
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:39,854
Put your hand on his heart. Yogi: He never
should come without asking us.

255
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,317
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right, it will be
all right.

256
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:46,520
Yogi: He should never come without
asking us. Shri Mataji: Is all right.

257
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:52,368
(Aside) What to do, open the window.

258
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:05,395
Open the window perhaps, maybe.

259
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:19,323
Yogi: Yes. Are there certain modifications?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

260
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:39,907
Correct, you are there. Is Nicholas, na?
Yogis: Yes.

261
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:43,113
Shri Mataji: He is very good.

262
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:56,919
Are you all right now?

263
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,766
Absolutely, in the beginning if you pick
people up, you have to tell him

264
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:14,086
just for the puja it’s too much vibrations
and too much for themselves to absorb.

265
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:17,888
So you have to be careful. But this Nicholas
is all right, he has suffered so much

266
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:24,593
that it’s good for him that he came
to the puja, must be about him.

267
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,465
But now only you must choose people
who can come to puja;

268
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:36,214
everybody can’t bear, you see, this is
too much of vibrations.

269
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:41,912
But, you see, I know who can come very
easily [of them?],

270
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:45,029
Very poor things - some of the seekers have
suffered so much

271
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,062
that one puja can settle them down 
completely.

272
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:57,873
It’s all right now, see. Are you all right
now? Person: Yes.

273
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:02,277
Yogi: He will never again. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: He will never again.

274
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:06,399
Shri Mataji: He doesn’t enquire. You know,
you know you have a right.

275
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,453
You are on the right path.]

276
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:17,349
So we again go back to the same point 
is of self-respect.

277
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:24,932
When you reach that state of love,

278
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:31,265
respect yourself, then you don’t condemn.

279
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:36,327
“Because I love Mother, how can I do
such a thing that will bring

280
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:43,949
bad name to Her? That’s not behooving
the way I should be.

281
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:49,392
I have to behave in a way that My Mother
likes.”

282
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:54,265
The whole all question is solved because
you have “Somebody” before you,

283
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,607
and you know what I like and what I 
don’t like.

284
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:05,206
So always you’ll try to do things which
will be pleasing to Me;

285
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:14,288
but actually it is not such a material 
pleasing but is the essence of it,

286
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:29,493
the essence of pleasing, and that if you
know what will make Me feel pleased…

287
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:32,218
Actually, I get lost when I think about
My pleasing,

288
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,697
I think, there’s nothing that pleases Me 
or displeases Me.

289
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:42,191
But maybe the Deities part of it, maybe 
that part of Me, maybe that,

290
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:48,006
because They always do things which
will please Me. They know.

291
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:54,217
So in the same manner, if you can really
work it out,

292
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,440
you’ll get that inner inspiration and
understanding.

293
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:10,983
The essence of everything, we are
on the principle of it, the Tattwa.

294
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:17,559
So the essence of everything if you catch…
“What is the essence of this?”

295
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:23,344
Now put that test to anything.

296
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,162
Just on the essence if you try to live,
the rest is looked after.

297
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,589
So the self-respect, the essence of
self-respect is:

298
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,630
“because I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

299
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:49,310
because I have got Self Realization and
because I love my Mother”.

300
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,732
This is the essence.

301
00:30:55,177 --> 00:31:06,377
If we can look to the essence of flowers –
why there are so many varieties?

302
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:12,947
So many varieties of flowers, just see.
Just tremendous. Why?

303
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:19,940
Because essence of beauty, the aesthetics
of beauty, is variety.

304
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:26,304
Every leaf, if you take out each leaf

305
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:33,073
it cannot be matched with anyone in the
whole world, exactly it will not be.

306
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:39,831
So the essence of aesthetics is variety.

307
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,257
So we have to have Sahaja Yogis
of different varieties,

308
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:51,362
of different nature, of different humour,
to humour ourselves.

309
00:31:51,563 --> 00:31:55,315
We are not to have everybody just the same.

310
00:31:55,516 --> 00:32:03,292
But in the essence of it, all of them have
to love the Mother.

311
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:07,915
Then the best of yours that you enjoy
the most,

312
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:15,590
not the flowers so much, not the nature so
much, nothing more than other Sahaja Yogis.

313
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:19,866
Once you start enjoying other Sahaja Yogis
and their company,

314
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,876
then you have achieved it.

315
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:30,384
I mean, imagine enjoying every human being
who is a Sahaja Yogi

316
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,503
and their company, then it’s more than
sufficient. What more do you want?

317
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:43,270
You don’t enjoy other people, you don’t
enjoy other things so much.

318
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:48,445
But if you are in a beautiful place and
beautiful circumstances

319
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:54,483
and you are with other Sahaja Yogis also,
then nothing like this.

320
00:32:54,684 --> 00:33:05,853
It becomes doubly enjoyable, I should say,
and every moment becomes an experience,

321
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:11,357
every person becomes an experience,
is like a wave of joy.

322
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:17,847
Every person you meet, every collectivity
you meet, every ashram you go to,

323
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:23,315
it creates a beautiful wave in your heart
of joy.

324
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:31,910
My joy is silent, but when I meet somebody,
then it shows itself up.

325
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:39,535
It comes up like a wave or sometimes
as you see these drops from the ocean

326
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:44,019
breaking on the shores, beautiful drops.
We call them tushhaar -

327
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,625
in Sanskrit language there’s a beautiful
name for that, tushhaar –

328
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:58,422
and then the waves go back to your heart.
So beautifully is the relationship

329
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:04,039
and you just watch it as a witness and
see the joy.

330
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:13,748
Then everything melts away, all your
knowledge so-called,

331
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,604
all your pains, all your troubles,
all your past,

332
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:25,688
all your future, but you remain in
the presence, in meditation,

333
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,305
watching all this beautiful happening.

334
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:38,657
May God all of you understand. 
May God in all of you

335
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:45,177
as Spirit emit that experience
all the time to all of you.

336
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:48,421
May God bless you.

337
00:34:52,896 --> 00:35:01,902
This is the sari from Greece. Just see
that art of Greece expressed,

338
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,055
beautiful.
Gregoire: It’s like the Aegean sea.

339
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:12,612
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Gregoire: The water is like the Aegean sea.

340
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:19,696
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Like in
the sea you have

341
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:25,976
blue and emerald, both colors, the same
way it is.

342
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:35,425
So now, only today, because we have come
first time to Turkey,

343
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:41,476
we’ll just have the establishment of Ganesha
and just wash My feet if possible;

344
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:45,927
bring some plate, our plate is there.

345
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:49,596
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, may I just read
a prayer at the beginning of the Puja?

346
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:52,427
Shri Mataji: All right.

347
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,488
Gregoire: So. Will we take three times
the mantra of Shri Ganesha

348
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:04,543
and then I will read a prayer for
the beginning of this Puja.

349
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:28,273
Gregoire: Shri Mataji, we bow before Thee
again and again.

350
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:35,967
We celebrate this Puja in the old imperial
city called Constantinopolis,

351
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:43,959
Byzantium and Istanbul, where Islam and
Christianity confronted each other,

352
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,722
on the shores of the Bosphorus, the gateway
between Russia

353
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:52,916
and the Mediterranean Sea between
north and south,

354
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:58,786
at the place where Asia and Europe meet
between East and West.

355
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:02,484
And as these two continents meet here,

356
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:10,792
 may two powerful desires of ours,
Thy children, meet in this Puja.

357
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:15,304
One desire is for the salvation
of the seekers

358
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:18,569
and the redemption of this world.

359
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:24,481
One desire is for Thy welfare, well-being

360
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:30,254
and good health of Thy earthly Incarnation.

361
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,680
As Asia is bigger than Europe,

362
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:47,024
so is the second desire of the yogis
much bigger than the first one.

363
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:54,514
Shri Mataji, we know that Sahaja Yoga
has been born

364
00:38:54,715 --> 00:39:02,027
in the fire of Thy tapasya, is sustained
by the fire of Thy tapasya.

365
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:08,099
We know that the cool fire of the Kundalini
is powered by the fire of Thy tapasya

366
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,796
and we know, as the whole worlds and
the fourteen universes do,

367
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:19,357
that Shri Shiva Himself was completely
overcome and conquered by Thy tapasya.

368
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,504
But, Shri Mataji, now it is too much.

369
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:30,918
The excruciating work and hardship that
Thou take on Thy physical body is inhuman.

370
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,190
And as Thou do all this for us, we pray
now that

371
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:41,695
as Sahaja Yoga was born in the fire
of Thy penance,

372
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:47,280
it may now be sprinkled by the cool rain
of Thy satisfaction.

373
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:52,714
That Sahaja Yoga may now grow through
Thee being prasanya.

374
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:56,606
Shri Mataji, in the last decade of this
century,

375
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:02,880
we pray that Sahaja Yoga will develop by
itself in the many countries of this world.

376
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:12,870
We might for instance organize two or three
important international Sahaja Yoga camps

377
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:16,623
where people will come from everywhere
as pilgrimage

378
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:21,602
toward the place where Thou will reside,

379
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:27,052
so that this punitive travel schedule
should definitely be alleviated;

380
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:39,111
and we ask this because we are Sahaja Yogis
and because we have our Realization

381
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:48,318
and because we love our Mother so much.

382
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,864
Shri Mataji: Now his desire power is more,
that’s why he’s crying.

383
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:56,799
Now let us see that, what our action power
is going to work out.

384
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,010
Put yourself to action power. You see,
the action power when it takes over,

385
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,451
it can be conquered with the desire power.

386
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,593
I also fill so much sometimes with
the desire power

387
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:19,446
that so much still to be done;

388
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:25,518
and if you want Me to tell you about it,
you must know

389
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:33,647
that all these rakshasas who came on this
earth, are known all over the world.

390
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:36,112
Everyone has heard about TM.

391
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:43,266
Everybody has heard about all kinds
of hoaxes.Think of it.

392
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,534
People have not even heard about
your Mother.

393
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:56,894
Now we’ve decided to put our declaration.
We have decided,

394
00:41:57,095 --> 00:42:00,620
but no newspaper will take it.

395
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:05,151
But if that horrible Rajneesh who has said
that, “I’m a hoax

396
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,002
and I’ve known how to make money

397
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:12,704
and I’m untruthful and I’m a businessman”,
who has openly said it,

398
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:17,924
but whatever he says everyday appears
in the newspaper in India.

399
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:24,470
So when I put Myself onto the other side
of it,

400
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:30,810
I feel that [a] lot of action still needs
to be done.

401
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:39,117
Firstly, he has some people who are so
dedicated, surprisingly,

402
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:44,735
and also they are paid by him because he 
has made money, so it’s a vicious circle.

403
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:47,535
He has made lots of money, he can pay
people,

404
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:51,648
he can pay newspaper people, he can pay
his disciples so-called,

405
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:55,761
and make them work for him. So it’s
a paid job.

406
00:42:55,962 --> 00:43:00,553
While Sahaja Yogis have to work on their
own.

407
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:11,739
So to say that action power of Mine should
stop or should take rest,

408
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:18,525
it will, when My desire will be fulfilled.

409
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:26,414
So it has to be established. Still
in Turkey we are afraid a little bit.

410
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,580
Nobody would accept it on the newspaper,
so we have to do something about it,

411
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:38,785
so that all those who are lost with other
gurus, with other people,

412
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:45,774
will just jump into it. People don’t even
know our name!

413
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:53,046
It’s all right, you people have gained
a lot, you have all the enjoyment,

414
00:43:53,247 --> 00:44:00,829
you are all doing everything; but it’s not
yet recorded.

415
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:05,210
We have to record it,

416
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:11,317
for that whatever has to be done we cannot
give up, at any cost.

417
00:44:17,508 --> 00:44:20,136
This is the problem.

418
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:24,523
So at least four years more I have to work
hard, I know that.

419
00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:30,882
As far as My body is concerned, I have
no problem.

420
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:35,006
I’m eternally fed with energy,

421
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:39,192
I don’t have problems, you don’t worry
about Me.

422
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:44,397
I look like an ordinary human being,
I’m not.

423
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:55,383
So don’t you worry. Be satisfied.

424
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:59,536
I’m not in any way harmed, no one can
harm Me,

425
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:03,903
no one can kill Me, nothing.

426
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:08,955
But we have to establish, that’s important.

427
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:21,031
Even a very ordinary person from India

428
00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:24,509
becomes well-known on the spiritual field,
just imagine,

429
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:32,456
who has done no work, somebody hanging
in the air.

430
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:53,494
So like I would say also that we have
to make sacrifices.

431
00:45:53,939 --> 00:46:00,984
As far as your feeling are concerned about
Me, that you don’t have to worry,

432
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:03,695
you are all looking after Me very well.

433
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:11,511
I’m overfed, not with food only but with
love and affection.

434
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:15,913
But we have to still do very much,
that would do.

435
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:20,270
So don’t you worry about Me, I’m perfectly
all right.

436
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:26,956
Do I look tired to you?
Gregoire: No, Shri Mataji, not now.

437
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:37,993
Yogi: Gregoire, Gregoire. 
Shri Mataji: This is not recorded, is it?

438
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:44,903
Yogi: It is on there, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: All right, camera is this on.

439
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:56,111
[Hindi] Now, today [Hindi].

440
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:04,467
Now today, you see, according to Hersh
is that in India,

441
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:07,430
they don’t wash My hands but wash My feet.

442
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:14,435
Yogi: We deserve to worship Your feet,
they do so much work, Shri Mataji…

443
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,466
Shri Mataji: No, but moreover the vibrations
are much more there,

444
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,783
I don’t know.
Yogi: Yes.

445
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:23,306
Shri Mataji: Is said that [Sanskrit words],

446
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:29,852
“from the Feet of such [a] person flows
the river Ganges”, you see,

447
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:36,750
or the river of the Gods, you see.
So the Feet have that speciality.

448
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:40,531
And imagine, the other day we did not do
this washing,

449
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:44,425
so Hersh told Me that, “Let us do the Feet 
washing”.

450
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:48,966
And we did it in this pot which is made
of copper.

451
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,651
And there was also some copper into it.

452
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:57,592
The whole night it was kept with the copper,
and it gets poisonous.

453
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:05,402
But nobody felt the poison. On the contrary,
vibrations improved.

454
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:13,050
So the poison was neutralized.
Just like when Shiva

455
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:16,158
drank all the poison and nothing happened,
in the same way.

456
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:18,189
[Indian yogi comments:“We had once prepared
in Madras,

457
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:25,613
I mean, in three hours it just – 
(indistinct) – then Mother repeated this” -

458
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:28,453
“Mother repeated”. (unclear)]

459
00:48:28,654 --> 00:48:31,931
Shri Mataji: Little bit… [Inaudible].

460
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:41,993
Now you can say the Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha. Atharva Sheersha.

461
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,714
If the people – if you try to remember
things by heart,

462
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:55,852
even some songs will be good idea, so that
you needn’t have books.

463
00:48:57,707 --> 00:49:02,231
[Puja continues with Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha.]

464
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:37,388
Shri Mataji: You can sing this song.
Yogi: "Ganesha Sthuti".

465
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:47,700
[Sahaja Yogis sing “Ganesha Sthuti”]

466
01:04:34,146 --> 01:04:37,069
Shri Mataji: So, “Ai Giri Nandini”.
Yogi: “Ai Giri Nandini”.

467
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:43,320
Shri Mataji: Vibrations is too much…
Vibrations is just so much.

468
01:04:46,163 --> 01:04:50,504
[Yogis sing “Ai Giri Nandini”]

469
01:12:38,573 --> 01:12:42,558
Shri Mataji: “Jogawa”, will you have this?
Yogi: “Jogawa”.

470
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:02,175
[Bhajan “Jogawa” is sung]

471
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:20,249
Shri Mataji: This song is composed
by Rajesh.

472

[“Chalat Musafir” is sung]
