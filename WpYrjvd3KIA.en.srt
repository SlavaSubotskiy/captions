1
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,999
You'll spoil the carpets, be careful

2
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,834
Please be seated.

3
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,333
It’s all right.

4
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,792
I hope you can hear Me all the way, can you?

5
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,083
Come forward a little bit, perhaps.

6
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,583
Today is a very

7
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:19,542
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

8
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:26,917
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

9
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:41,375
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

10
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:46,667
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

11
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,999
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

12
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,375
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

13
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,750
by the fanatics,

14
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:02,417
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

15
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:15,999
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

16
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,709
and the fanaticism

17
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,375
that makes person thinks always

18
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,709
that they are on the right

19
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,999
and they have every right to be

20
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,333
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

21
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,125
another person.

22
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,999
And these fanaticisms grew

23
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,333
since long – it’s not a new thing.

24
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:57,667
It is so obvious now that our main problem

25
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,999
in this world is of fanaticism.

26
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,667
Fatima lost Her two children,

27
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,667
and She was the embodiment of

28
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,208
Gruha Lakshmi.

29
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,375
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

30
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,458
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

31
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:29,750
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

32
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:35,458
can be only corrected by Fatima.

33
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,834
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

34
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,166
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

35
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:47,500
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

36
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:55,625
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

37
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,000
a very, very important place.

38
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,999
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

39
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:09,125
there were struggles and fights

40
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,999
and wars going on between different tribes.

41
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,583
As a result many, many

42
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:21,834
young men were killed.

43
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:28,417
Only quite old people survived,

44
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,834
and also so many women.

45
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,999
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

46
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,417
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

47
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:47,208
but you cannot allow them to remain

48
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:55,959
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

49
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,542
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

50
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,667
for that religion.”

51
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,500
So He understood that unless and until

52
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:13,250
women are kept absolutely chaste,

53
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,083
absolutely pure,

54
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,917
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

55
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,709
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

56
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:27,458
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

57
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:31,834
meaning “Where the women are respected,

58
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,792
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

59
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,083
not that they are to be worshipped,

60
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,125
but they are respectable –

61
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:45,999
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

62
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:51,291
So, so much responsibility is on women.

63
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,792
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

64
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,333
She did not go out of Her house

65
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:03,125
and She remained a housewife,

66
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,999
and She made Her two children grow up

67
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:11,083
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

68
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,999
against fanaticism.

69
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,667
Her husband also was there.

70
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,750
This is how a woman of a housewife

71
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,250
is shown to be so powerful that though

72
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,333
she’s in the house, though she’s –

73
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,417
looks to be just a mother,

74
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,333
but how powerful she is.

75
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:43,500
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

76
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,208
Men also have been very nasty

77
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,125
and very aggressive with women.

78
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:53,999
As a result we find there’s a big

79
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,999
opposition to men,

80
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,250
and a kind of a big rift has been created

81
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,417
between men and women.

82
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,709
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

83
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,375
perverted,

84
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,333
going to bad women,

85
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,542
the good women also thought,

86
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,375
“Why not we also become like that?”

87
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,166
and they also started doing wrong things

88
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,667
which they should not have done.

89
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:33,333
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

90
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:39,125
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

91
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:45,000
and also the nation, as administrators,

92
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:49,083
but women are responsible for the society.

93
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,875
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

94
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,750
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

95
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,083
she is responsible for

96
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:05,417
the maintenance of the society.

97
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,583
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

98
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,166
that she’s dominated,

99
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,125
that her husband dominates her,

100
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,083
that the husband’s family dominates her,

101
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,875
but it’s the quality of a woman

102
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,792
that brings up the level of the society.

103
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,250
Not only the level,

104
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,999
but also in the family she is then respected.

105
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,542
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

106
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,500
perhaps we never realize it.

107
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,999
Now we see so many lights here,

108
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,750
electricity is there running.

109
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,999
But what is the source of this electricity?

110
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:51,417
Is it not much more important than these lights?

111
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:57,166
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

112
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,999
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

113
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,999
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

114
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,208
I was surprised when I went to

115
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,333
Italy also, that

116
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:17,917
how women have made themself cheap.

117
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,750
And they want to look attractive to every man.

118
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,999
What is the need?

119
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,834
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

120
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,208
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

121
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,750
This cheapness of women

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,667
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

123
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,709
I know one feels very unhappy

124
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,375
the way men treat them.

125
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,291
But you must have your own personality,

126
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,917
you must have your own understanding

127
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,458
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

128
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,458
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

129
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,709
But if you do not keep to your own

130
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,625
personality or your chastity,

131
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,750
then you cannot achieve

132
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,166
your goal in life.

133
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:20,625
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

134
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,999
to your husband,

135
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,166
to all the society the woman gives power.

136
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,542
I am also a woman, as you know,

137
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,709
and I also have a family.

138
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,083
With all the powers that I have,

139
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,999
I never showed them that I have those powers.

140
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,625
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

141
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,583
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

142
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,750
And he also came from a society

143
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,999
which was more Islamic-oriented.

144
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,333
But that was just a joke for Me,

145
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,291
because I thought

146
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,208
“He’s just like a child

147
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,375
and I have to be

148
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,875
very patient with him.”

149
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,583
He always says that because of My powers

150
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,583
he earned everything in life.

151
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,375
Always, in the of everyone he says so.

152
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,750
I don’t know that part, but definitely

153
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,875
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

154
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,417
I never think the way other people think

155
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,750
that we must try to dominate the husband,

156
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,458
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

157
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,999
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

158
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:46,709
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

159
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,834
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

160
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,208
to do something wrong,

161
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,750
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

162
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,667
That’s slavishness. Men have to be men.

163
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:01,083
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

164
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,999
I do not say it that way;

165
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,999
because if you have your own powers,

166
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,792
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

167
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,625
he’ll have to come and

168
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:17,291
understand what you want.

169
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,333
He’ll have to know what you are.

170
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,458
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

171
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,625
that it has done that way.

172
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,208
I would never say anything.

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,083
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

174
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,750
All right.

175
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,999
After all he has to fight outside

176
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,166
and he has to take out temper on Me

177
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,458
that he couldn’t do:

178
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,208
if he does this to others they will beat him,

179
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,875
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

180
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,583
And I never, never felt that way

181
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,041
that he’s dominating Me.

182
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,125
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

183
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,999
But I’ve seen that whenever

184
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:59,333
I said something to him, he thought about it.

185
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,999
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

186
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,999
and all these decisions

187
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,333
he still remembers one by one

188
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,709
and knows that it was very, very important.

189
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,291
Other things I never tell him what to do.

190
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,999
Whatever was most important is the principle.

191
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,166
Now, he also realized that

192
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,999
I have a very important mission.

193
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,333
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

194
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,500
But first I had to establish Myself

195
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,999
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

196
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,959
The men as a whole are very different type,

197
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,875
you must understand.

198
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,375
They are extroverts,

199
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,834
and whatever the women care

200
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,083
too much for, they do not.

201
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,792
It’s all right,

202
00:16:56,041 --> 00:17:00,000
because women and men are complementary.

203
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:04,417
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

204
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:09,417
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

205
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,999
who never went out,

206
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,875
but he knew his source of energy

207
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,333
from where it was coming.

208
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,458
Because women were never respected as shakti,

209
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,417
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

210
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,750
that “we have to fight men,

211
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,834
they are problematic, they are troubling us

212
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,792
and we should take revenge.”

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,458
That’s how society cannot work out.

214
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,750
Responsibility of the women is much greater

215
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,208
than that of men.

216
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,083
Men have to just go to offices,

217
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:55,999
work it out something, come back home.

218
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,542
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

219
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,750
for the growth of the children,

220
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,750
the protection of the husband,

221
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,291
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

222
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,291
That’s why in India we say,

223
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,999
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

224
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,166
and she has to be respectable.”

225
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,667
Moreover it is not only in India,

226
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:25,166
I’ve seen it all over that women

227
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,208
are always respected if they are housewives.

228
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,417
For example,

229
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:34,667
I go with My husband to some function.

230
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,583
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

231
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:39,583
For example,

232
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,999
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

233
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,542
his secretary won’t be respected.

234
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,917
No one.

235
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,917
I, as his wife, is respected the same way

236
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,709
because I’m his wife.

237
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,333
Nobody looks down upon Me

238
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,583
because I’m somebody’s wife.

239
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,834
Is all over it is like this.

240
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,709
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

241
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,250
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

242
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,667
always looked after her body and just

243
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,999
to be thin and all that,

244
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,375
and she wanted to all the men

245
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,834
and all kinds of things,

246
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,999
she would wear, you see, jeans and, you know, quite old lady.

247
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,500
And her husband was a big man

248
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,999
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

249
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,208
very senior to us.

250
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,166
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

251
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,792
So, she was not there.

252
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,542
So many asked him, so many people,

253
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,291
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

254
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,375
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

255
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,834
She was to come here.”

256
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

257
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:51,000
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

258
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,458
So before sitting for the dinner

259
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,750
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

260
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,792
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,999
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

262
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,166
So she said, “They made me sit here.

263
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,417
I don’t know what to do.”

264
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,417
So I brought her out. I said,

265
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,125
“Why did you make her sit there?”

266
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,999
And she was thinking she’s very smart

267
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,750
she’s done her hair nicely,

268
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,375
she’s looking like an actress.

269
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,000
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

270
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,583
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

271
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,291
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

272
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,999
the way she was dressed stupidly.

273
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,750
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

274
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,625
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

275
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,917
gentleman so highly placed.”

276
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,999
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

277
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,709
smoking.

278
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,792
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

279
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,750
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

280
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,959
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

281
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,959
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

282
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,542
And they still thought, all the rest,

283
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,375
she’s the secretary who has come.

284
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,208
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

285
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,750
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

286
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:15,500
at that old age behaving stupidly.

287
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:19,041
So even in the West a woman is respected

288
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,542
if she’s a good housewife.

289
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,583
Anywhere, she is respected.

290
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,834
I was surprised also that

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,792
I knew somebody very highly placed,

292
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,458
a minister in the cabinet

293
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,000
of England,

294
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,000
and he was

295
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,125
supposed to be little wayward

296
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,083
and nobody would take notice of him.

297
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,166
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

298
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,250
I was not so good at the scandals

299
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,125
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

300
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,041
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

301
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,834
“No, not worth it.”

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,291
I said, “Why?”

303
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:11,917
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

304
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,959
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

305
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,750
They said, “He’s a flirt,

306
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:19,709
and he is looking at other women

307
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:23,041
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

308
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,999
and they told stories about him. My God!

309
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,208
Such a big man like a minister –

310
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,792
why is he behaving like this?

311
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,792
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

312
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,709
Nobody would shake hands with him.

313
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,999
Even men would not look at him.

314
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:46,458
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

315
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,417
stupid people. That’s different.

316
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,542
But one Sahaja Yogi

317
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,959
who will visit these places

318
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,375
will be amazed how stupid they are.

319
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,583
They can make it out.

320
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:04,000
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

321
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,792
whether they are women or men.

322
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:11,834
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

323
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,458
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

324
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,208
What diseases you'll have?

325
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:22,999
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

326
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,500
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

327
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,208
Women think they can dominate their husband,

328
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,375
they can do this to their husband,

329
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,999
they can put them right, but they don’t know

330
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:38,999
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

331
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,834
I know of somebody who was suffering

332
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,417
from blood cancer, but we cured him

333
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,542
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

334
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,834
Again and again he was getting relapse.

335
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,999
Then we found out it was his wife.

336
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,166
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

337
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,417
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

338
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,834
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

339
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,375
if you live with that woman.

340
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,875
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

341
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,750
But if you are going to live with this woman,

342
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,625
I’m not going to treat you.”

343
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,625
He also called her and I told her on her face

344
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,083
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

345
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,999
and if you try to torture your husband,

346
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,999
he cannot be cured.”

347
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,125
But she went on.

348
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:35,999
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

349
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,875
He developed a big spleen like that,

350
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,999
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

351
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,083
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

352
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,291
So on both the cases, I would say,

353
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,417
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

354
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:54,000
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

355
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,875
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

356
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,458
Now, we are husband and wife

357
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,208
because we love each other, we are complementary.

358
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,834
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

359
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:10,500
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

360
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,999
and women should not expect men to be like you –

361
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:20,834
very, I should say, noble.

362
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,583
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

363
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:29,999
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

364
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,917
If her chastity is disturbed,

365
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,625
then she is a dangerous person,

366
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,999
very dangerous.

367
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:43,083
She can not only harm her husband,

368
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,999
but also her children, her society.

369
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,999
We come from a culture which is very akin

370
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,625
to Islamic culture also.

371
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,667
Indian culture is like that.

372
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,917
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

373
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,583
more than anything in this world.

374
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:06,291
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

375
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,917
And once - there’s a story

376
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,999
I must tell you, very interesting,

377
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,959
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

378
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,999
She was the wife of a king.

379
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:20,083
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

380
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,792
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

381
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,125
See, this is, was a funny thing.

382
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,959
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

383
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,000
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

384
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,250
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

385
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,583
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

386
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:42,375
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

387
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,250
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

388
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,500
but he might see my reflection.”

389
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:52,667
So she stood before a mirror

390
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,709
and he saw her reflection.

391
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:57,000
Then he became even more mad

392
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,500
and he said, “I must have this woman.

393
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,750
If you don’t give her to me,

394
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,542
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

395
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:08,875
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

396
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:12,000
shows what a useless fellow he was.

397
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,667
So he brought all his army, everything,

398
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,750
and settled down near the fort

399
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:20,792
where these people were, and sent a message that

400
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,458
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

401
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,125
then I’m going to attack.”

402
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:30,667
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

403
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:34,792
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

404
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:38,375
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

405
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,999
This is a question of our prestige.”

406
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,834
They took a hundred palanquin.

407
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,709
Do you understand palanquin?

408
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,750
They took a hundred palanquin.

409
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:56,166
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

410
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,417
sitting with these arms and their machines,

411
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,750
and there were two who were carrying them.

412
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,166
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

413
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,000
hundred maids.”

414
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,792
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

415
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,417
having his drinks and things, very happy

416
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,208
that the queen is going to come.

417
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:18,583
So these people went there

418
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:22,999
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

419
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:28,792
They had told these women that “In case we win,

420
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,417
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

421
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,291
and you will see the fire,

422
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,250
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

423
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:41,625
But if we do not win, then you should know

424
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:45,000
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

425
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:49,000
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

426
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,166
and thousands were with this man and he had

427
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,792
guns and cannons and everything.

428
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,542
So they started fighting.

429
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,999
In that fight

430
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:05,083
that Muslim king won -

431
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,208
because he had so much of power -

432
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,125
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

433
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,709
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

434
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:21,417
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

435
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:26,125
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

436
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,542
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

437
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,709
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

438
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,875
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

439
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,500
Any other man coming and touching them

440
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,709
means their chastity is finished.

441
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,999
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

442
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,999
So, how they respected their chastity!

443
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,625
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

444
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,917
another

445
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,458
temptation,

446
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:05,333
but if this is your power,

447
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,792
why you should submit yourself

448
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:10,999
to something which is so useless?

449
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:14,000
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

450
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,750
Men also must know that if their

451
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,875
wives are so chaste and so good,

452
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,250
they must respect them.

453
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:26,250
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

454
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,709
which is that we are very chaste people.

455
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,208
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

456
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:38,625
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

457
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,375
who does not respect the chastity.

458
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,333
Then the men also become chaste.

459
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,375
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

460
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,875
And this chastity is your main power,

461
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:56,000
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

462
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,291
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

463
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,834
you know how powerful you become

464
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,625
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

465
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,166
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

466
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:14,125
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

467
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,792
One has to give up all the past ideas,

468
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:22,375
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

469
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,999
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

470
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,458
Recently I read a beautiful book,

471
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:34,999
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

472
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:40,333
In that they have said that how this media has put

473
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:45,000
ideas into the heads of women and men,

474
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:51,291
decrying the utility of married life

475
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,542
how they have killed the married life.

476
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:59,458
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

477
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,999
The same thing goes on all the time.

478
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,500
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

479
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,542
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

480
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:12,834
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

481
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,500
that also is established.

482
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,500
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

483
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,709
People understand the importance of married life.

484
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:25,999
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

485
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:30,999
it is a tapasya with which you understand

486
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,999
your own powers.

487
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,959
I would say a man is like the sun, but

488
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:41,166
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

489
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,875
The difference is like this:

490
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:47,291
that the sun shines, gives light,

491
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:52,125
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

492
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,417
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

493
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,667
she bears so much of things,

494
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,625
she bears all our sins.

495
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:06,083
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

496
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,750
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

497
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,875
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

498
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:16,291
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

499
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,083
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

500
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,750
through my education,

501
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,625
through my

502
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,333
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

503
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:33,333
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

504
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:38,417
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

505
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,709
This is the typical

506
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,250
ideology of a woman.

507
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:51,208
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

508
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,083
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

509
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,875
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

510
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,458
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

511
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,583
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

512
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,667
This is a woman’s attitude.

513
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,959
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

514
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,875
of them had come to see Me.

515
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,999
I was sitting with them in an open space,

516
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,875
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

517
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,959
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

518
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,999
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

519
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,458
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

520
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,458
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

521
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,583
She had prepared all kinds of things,

522
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,583
her friends also came to help her.

523
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,792
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

524
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,917
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

525
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:40,041
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

526
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,000
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

527
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,417
she’d go round and round and round ...”

528
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,709
I said, “Why?”

529
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,583
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

530
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:56,417
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

531
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,000
I was quite surprised.

532
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,999
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

533
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,375
We want to give love, and

534
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:14,166
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

535
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,959
whether you are a brother or a husband

536
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:22,000
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

537
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,999
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

538
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,750
not only joyous but also religious.

539
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,125
Because it’s a relative thing.

540
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,291
If a woman starts misbehaving,

541
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,625
that’s the worst for the society:

542
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,208
men also start misbehaving.

543
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,500
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

544
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,709
So to control them,

545
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,917
put them as householders,

546
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,999
women must know how to keep them.

547
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,667
It’s not easy to run a house,

548
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:59,917
it’s not easy to run your family,

549
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:04,417
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

550
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:09,208
And those who have those qualities are the best women

551
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,583
and they really achieve it.

552
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:16,750
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

553
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,667
how much they loved you,

554
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,208
all the men and the women.

555
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,333
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

556
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:26,542
Because she sacrificed everything,

557
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,458
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

558
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,417
She did so much for you, so you could...

559
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:39,250
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

560
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,250
tremendous!

561
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,083
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

562
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,709
She gave Her two children to be killed.

563
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:54,834
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

564
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,125
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

565
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,834
She knew Her children will be killed,

566
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,333
but still She sent Her children,

567
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,166
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

568
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:09,333
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

569
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:12,750
Such bravery, such courage,

570
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:18,208
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

571
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:22,208
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

572
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,542
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

573
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,709
for the war. Stay at home.”

574
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,667
And if She had forced them not to go,

575
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,208
then they would not have gone.

576
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,709
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

577
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,875
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

578
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,333
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

579
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:48,625
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

580
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:53,000
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

581
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,500
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

582
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,750
Because these fundamentalists

583
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:05,792
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

584
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:11,583
So today is a day I have to tell men also

585
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:17,083
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

586
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,542
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

587
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:26,999
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

588
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,417
Not that she should be respectable

589
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,709
but you should see that everyone respects her,

590
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:36,291
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

591
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,750
be identified with her.

592
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:41,709
But if she’s not a chaste woman

593
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:45,458
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

594
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:49,041
I do not have that much courage to say that

595
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,999
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

596
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,375
It’s very difficult.

597
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,709
I don’t know what complications might come.

598
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:01,999
With all these experiences

599
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,625
one learns one thing for definite,

600
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:09,542
that woman is much more inward,

601
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,667
she has much more powers,

602
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:16,667
she is much more wiser than other people are,

603
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,083
if she keeps to her chastity.

604
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:25,583
That’s the point on which all her

605
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:30,583
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

606
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,625
She may be anything.

607
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:35,000
We had women – like there was a lady who was

608
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:39,083
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

609
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,999
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

610
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,542
and she fought a very horrible king called as

611
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,792
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

612
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:51,417
her name was Tarabai.

613
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,999
We have women in India of different, different,

614
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,750
say, characters in a way,

615
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,834
fighting in different, different ways,

616
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:05,917
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

617
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:10,291
All their powers were there as housewives.

618
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,709
So do not look down upon

619
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,583
the housewife.

620
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,792
When I’m traveling in the plane,

621
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,875
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

622
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,208
“Housewife.”

623
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,875
My profession is housewife.

624
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,999
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

625
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,792
I’m looking after My children,

626
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,999
I’m loving them, they love Me,

627
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,667
and this profession is the best, I think,

628
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:49,792
because it is so joy-giving,

629
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,625
it’s so beautiful.

630
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,709
It’s love.

631
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,333
It’s so energy-giving.

632
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,333
And at this age also I never feel My age,

633
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:08,999
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

634
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,792
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

635
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,792
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

636
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:19,542
and I must not do this work or that...

637
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:25,375
Because this feeling of love

638
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,583
for My children: I have to nourish them,

639
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,625
I have to look after them,

640
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,667
because all My powers I have to give them.

641
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,999
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

642
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,250
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

643
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,291
That’s the only desire I have,

644
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,667
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

645
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,417
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

646
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,458
but as far as I am concerned

647
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:57,041
I want that you should forget as to

648
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,375
what powers I have, but you should yourself

649
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,792
have all these powers within yourself,

650
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,417
so that you can save the world.

651
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,999
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

652
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,041
And I want to assure you that you all can have

653
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,999
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

654
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:20,291
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

655
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:25,333
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

656
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,999
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

657
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,625
things that men are doing and women are doing;

658
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,750
we are not.

659
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,083
In the evolutionary process,

660
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,542
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

661
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,834
that became human beings. But no,

662
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,834
in between there were some other human beings

663
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,333
that came in, which vanished.

664
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:51,250
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

665
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,625
who will be saved. All the rest will be not there -

666
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:58,041
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

667
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,750
These are all self-destroying things

668
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,125
which kills the family,

669
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:07,709
which kills the chastity within us,

670
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,999
and then we are left high and dry.

671
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,959
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

672
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,999
we have problems. So be careful,

673
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:21,208
very, very careful.

674
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:26,083
And this special puja for

675
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,041
Fatima Bi is

676
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,834
puja of Vishnumaya.

677
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,792
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

678
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:38,417
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

679
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:39,792
You’ll never feel guilty,

680
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:42,250
because that’s such a virtue you have.

681
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,709
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

682
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:48,875
and you can stand up to any nonsense

683
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:53,291
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

684
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,250
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

685
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,375
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

686
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:06,999
May God bless you.

687
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:19,083
Right, so now we have very few children …

688
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,291
How many children we have?

689
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,999
Come along, come along, come along.

690
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,458
Let’s sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

691
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,458
All right, you can sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

692
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,375
Let’s say the Ganesha’s mantra,

693
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,083
and then we’ll sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

694
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:41,208
and after that we’ll have the hundred-and-eight names.

695
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:26,291
This stone, feroza, comes from Iraq,

696
01:46:26,667 --> 01:46:31,583
and Fatima used to wear quartz, no doubt about it.

697
01:46:33,166 --> 01:46:35,999
This one is called as a quartz;

698
01:46:36,166 --> 01:46:38,041
it’s called as feroza.

699
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:41,999
And full of it, it’s there in Iraq, so many.

700
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:47,000
She used to wear this feroza, it’s absolutely correct.

701
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,083
Also this, for your information, ...

702
01:47:22,417 --> 01:47:25,125
these vases also come from Iraq,

703
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:27,999
also from the same place where She was.

704
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:31,709
So just see the coincidence,

705
01:47:31,917 --> 01:47:35,083
exactly, at this time, to come from Iraq.

706
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:40,000
May God bless that country and may there be peace.

707
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:23,083
There’s another suggestion that everybody cannot

708
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:28,959
go to India, so people can’t get married, you see.

709
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:32,834
So we’re thinking of also organizing marriages,

710
01:55:34,166 --> 01:55:37,125
when – during Diwali Puja.

711
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:40,999
But you won’t have such a wide choice, that’s the point is.

712
01:55:41,166 --> 01:55:44,999
Doesn’t matter. Those who want to get married

713
01:55:45,208 --> 01:55:49,208
should send Me forms filled in,

714
01:55:49,417 --> 01:55:51,959
and send it to Guido.

715
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:58,999
And another thing is that we can’t have

716
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:03,750
the same elaborate way as we have it in India. We try,

717
01:56:03,999 --> 01:56:06,375
but still you know it’s very difficult.

718
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:08,625
It’s a different country.

719
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:11,792
We’re trying to find out things

720
01:56:11,999 --> 01:56:14,917
that can be worked out.

721
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:17,417
In any case

722
01:56:18,999 --> 01:56:22,250
we’ll organize the marriages, because you don’t want

723
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:27,041
another type, a simple type, you want to have Indian style.

724
01:56:29,917 --> 01:56:32,917
So I’ll go to India before Diwali,

725
01:56:33,083 --> 01:56:35,458
try to organize things for you.

726
01:56:35,667 --> 01:56:38,792
May God bless you.

727
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:04,125
Thank you very much for everything.

728
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:10,083
I’m sorry I couldn’t get presents

729
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,709
for all of you - all of you this time.
