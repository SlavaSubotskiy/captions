1
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:10,143
And in Navratri you know that the puja

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:14,819
should be performed in the night.

3
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:24,337
To dispel the darkness, it is very important

4
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,944
that we bring light in the night itself.

5
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:35,556
Today, there is also another coincidence

6
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:53,286
that you are celebrating My birthday.

7
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:08,334
On this day, Gauriji established Shri Ganesha after her marriage.

8
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:17,617
Shri Ganesha is the source of purity, of purity.

9
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:24,116
 The first thing established in this world was purity .

10
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:30,558
So that, whatever living beings, the human beings

11
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,736
all those who came into this world

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,644
should be protected by purity.

13
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:47,213
and be away from impure things.

14
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:59,541
That is why, the whole creation was drenched with purity by Gauri ji.

15
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:04,494
And after that the creation came into existence.

16
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:09,703
So in our lives, the most important work is that

17
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:16,252
that within ourselves, we should place purity at the highest level.

18
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:25,655
But purity does not mean

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,137
 that we take our bath, wash ourselves

20
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:34,423
clean up,  keep our body alright

21
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:40,006
but to clean our hearts.

22
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:45,540
The biggest disorder of the heart is anger.

23
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:50,124
Anger is the highest disorder of heart.

24
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:55,093
And when a man gets angry

25
00:02:55,117 --> 00:03:04,930
that which is purity gets destroyed.

26
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:12,871
Because another name of purity is selfless love.

27
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:21,985
That love which always flows and does not expect anything.

28
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,409
The satisfaction of this love is that it is just flowing.

29
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:35,197
And when it does not flow, it gets suffocated and disturbed.

30
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:44,543
So, purity means that you fill your heart with love, not with anger.

31
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:49,883
Anger is in any case our enemy

32
00:03:49,907 --> 00:04:00,956
but, it is the enemy of the whole world.

33
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,756
All the wars that have taken place in the whole world

34
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,974
all the losses that have taken place

35
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:13,609
have been because of collective anger.

36
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,445
There are many excuses for anger.

37
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:19,787
I got angry because this thing had happened.

38
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:23,131
 I got angry because that thing had happened.

39
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:28,277
Man can always find some reason to get angry.

40
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:36,888
But even extremely destructive things like war are there because of this anger.

41
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:41,623
The basic reason behind that is anger.

42
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:50,354
If our heart is full of love, we cannot get angry.

43
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:59,798
And even if anger is shown off, that too will be for love only.

44
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:04,666
Even when an evil ‘Rakshasa’ (devil) is destroyed

45
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,526
that is also done out of Love

46
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,706
because he deserves to be killed

47
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,842
so that he does not commit any more sins.

48
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,713
But this is not the work of human beings.

49
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:24,751
 This is the work of Devi, which She has done during Navaratris.

50
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:28,813
So, expand your heart and see in your heart

51
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:36,260
 whom do we offer such love which is selfless love

52
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,043
for whom we do not feel that

53
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:45,245
this is my son, this is my sister, my house, my things.

54
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,547
Whom do we love like that?

55
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:55,233
For whom do we have such love?

56
00:05:55,257 --> 00:06:01,095
You have reached a much higher state than that of a human being.

57
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,794
Because you are a Sahajyogi.

58
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:11,788
You are connected to this subtle power of love, of God Almighty.

59
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:15,160
And this power is flowing continuously within you

60
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:23,558
 is nourishing you, is protecting you and is elevating you.

61
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:29,380
Repeatedly, it motivates you, protects you

62
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:38,919
gives you pure joy and enriches you with sweet love.

63
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:46,955
You have been united with this beautiful power

64
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:54,615
 but how much place do we have in our heart for such kind of power

65
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:58,790
has to be seen.

66
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:08,610
In our heart we have love for our Mother, that is true.

67
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:13,017
All of you, love your Mother

68
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:22,938
 and because of this love you are tuned, you are in tune with the joy.

69
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:27,752
But we should have two more types of love within us.

70
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:33,155
Only then, we can say that you love your Mother.

71
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,153
Firstly, we should love ourselves

72
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:45,134
that we are Sahajayogis. We got this power very easily.

73
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:51,306
But now, how should we  grow (spiritually)?

74
00:07:51,330 --> 00:08:01,367
Many people work very hard to spread Sahaja yoga

75
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:08,194
which we can call the horizontal movement.

76
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:12,291
It is like spreading from earth, in all the directions.

77
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:14,978
They do not put attention on themselves.

78
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:18,248
Thus the vertical movement

79
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:23,619
They did not achieve their spiritual growth.

80
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:29,073
They can do a lot of things outside, they can run about

81
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:35,503
outside they can do work, get things done, meet everybody.

82
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:39,630
But cannot develop their inner power.

83
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:43,733
Many people put a lot of attention towards their inner power

84
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,657
and do not put attention towards outside.

85
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:50,067
So, they do not get balance.

86
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:54,716
And when people put attention on the outside only

87
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,740
 their inner power becomes less and less.

88
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,294
And while becoming so less and less

89
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:07,097
they go to the brink and in no time, start falling into the ego trip.

90
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:12,684
They think how much we have worked for Sahajayoga.

91
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,496
How much we work hard for Sahajyoga!

92
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,928
And then a new life starts of such people

93
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:28,001
which is not at all useful for Sahajayoga.

94
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:32,928
They start thinking about themselves that, i am a very great leader

95
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:38,048
and everybody should give us lot of importance

96
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:41,727
which is called self-importance.

97
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:47,115
So, everywhere they see that they should be given importance.

98
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,712
In everything they will try to show their own importance

99
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:56,344
show their own specialty, always come in the front

100
00:09:56,368 --> 00:10:04,040
but from inside there is a hollowness.

101
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,330
And then suddenly we see that

102
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:12,959
that they are suffering from some kind of a sickness

103
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,031
have become mad.

104
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:18,823
They have some big problem in their life.

105
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,225
Then they start saying

106
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:24,405
Mother, "We had completely surrendered to You

107
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:31,607
 so how did this happen?"

108
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,126
How did we get it?

109
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:39,150
How did this go wrong?

110
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:43,940
Its responsibility lies on you only.

111
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:47,302
You got mesmerized.

112
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:52,946
Such people go one sided.

113
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,522
They cannot get along with other people.

114
00:10:56,546 --> 00:11:00,768
Their only connection is how much they can dominate others.

115
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:06,933
And how can  they show that they are superior people.

116
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,531
Then they go on showing their own importance.

117
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:15,469
They should be included in everything and always given importance.

118
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:19,351
If someone does not give him any importance then it is a great mistake.

119
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,310
Then they start faltering to such an extent

120
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:30,298
that they will even forget that they have to do something for Mother

121
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,944
that you have to donate something for Mother also.

122
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:40,259
Like this, I see that in some places like Rahuri, in Bombay

123
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:46,082
everywhere some people suddenly come up

124
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,029
and think that they were very important.

125
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:55,544
And in such places, neither there would be Aarti

126
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,376
and luckily for Me there would be at least My photo.

127
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:02,745
but nobody had even a desire to clean the photo.

128
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,412
Thank God, they did not put their own photo!

129
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:12,360
Their own importance and their own show off!

130
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,432
And by showing off, thinking of themselves superior

131
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:17,810
 different from others.

132
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:22,073
 Not asking anybody anything, nothing. We will do.

133
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,177
Then the quarrels started.

134
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,360
After the quarells started, groups formed.

135
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:31,300
Because, the bond that binds you all together

136
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:34,667
is the thread of your Mother.

137
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,368
And if you remain in that bond

138
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,841
and know all the time

139
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,644
that we are the children of the same Mother

140
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,685
and that nobody is higher or lower.

141
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,237
Neither, we do any work

142
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:53,309
this Chaitanya (the All-Pervading power of God) is doing everything.

143
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,655
We don't do anything at all.

144
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,028
When this feeling itself is over

145
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:01,814
that i am so great, i have done this

146
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,823
i did this and will do this and i will do that

147
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:16,034
then chaitanya says," Ok do whatever you want to do

148
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:17,959
go wherever you want to go."

149
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,161
Have you to go to hell? Go!

150
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:24,775
If you want to destroy yourself, you can destroy yourself.

151
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:27,443
If you want to do your complete destruction that also you do.

152
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:31,799
Whatever you want to do, you do.

153
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:38,944
It will not stop you because it respects your freedom.

154
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,934
 If you want to go to heaven there is arrangement for that

155
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,474
and if you want to go to hell there is arrangement for that too.

156
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:51,085
But in Sahaja Yoga there is one more big drawback

157
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:54,448
one very big drawback.

158
00:13:54,472 --> 00:14:00,141
We are a big Virat Shakti (collective power)

159
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:07,707
We are not alone, we are part and parcel of the same body.

160
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,114
But in that (body) if one person gets like this

161
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,859
or two or four persons become like that

162
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,877
who start making their own group

163
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:20,942
then like cancer malignancy, that only one cell starts growing

164
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:27,400
then that person can grow and can contaminate whole Sahajayoga.

165
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:34,996
And all My efforts can be in vain.

166
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:38,379
We should learn from sea

167
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,968
which stays at the lowest level

168
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:51,561
and absorbs all the rivers inside itself.

169
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:56,001
And without sea the world cannot exist

170
00:14:56,025 --> 00:15:01,608
and by evaporating itself, by making steam

171
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:06,518
gives the gift of monsoon to the whole world.

172
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:17,504
Its humility is a sign of its depth, but this humility is not superficial

173
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,436
that we say hello Mister, Bhaisahab namaste, nothing like this.

174
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,520
It remains at the lowest level

175
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:27,149
it absorbs everything, purifying everything

176
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:32,084
and then it converts itself into steam and showers the rain.

177
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:36,062
And then the same rain pouring down into the rivers

178
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:41,991
comes running towards the same sea.

179
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:44,397
And the recognition of this sea

180
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:50,317
if you go to the shore of any sea you will observe that there

181
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:56,332
all the coconut trees, which are there, are always bent towards the sea.

182
00:15:56,357 --> 00:16:00,117
There is a lot of breeze

183
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,066
come what may

184
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,036
but they never turn away from the sea

185
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:11,352
because they know that it is sea.

186
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:16,010
So, like the sea only, our heart will become vast only when

187
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,775
when we we will have extremely humbleness and love in our heart.

188
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,563
But giving self-importance only, feeling always that we are something special

189
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:31,408
in that case, the greatest disadvantage is

190
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,784
that Paramchaitanya will cut you off. It will say, "Go away".

191
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,871
if you want to make yourself important, 'Go away'!

192
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,960
And then it cuts you off, just like a nail is cut and thrown.

193
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:43,733
in the same way, you will be thrown away on one side.

194
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:47,466
which is very painful for me.

195
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,818
So when such 3-4 people start thinking that they are doing a lot of work

196
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:55,475
we have done this, we have done that

197
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,281
they should immeditely cool down

198
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,428
step back and introspect themselves

199
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:06,839
''Do we meditate? Do we go into meditation? How deep we are?"

200
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:13,230
And then whom do we love?

201
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,278
Who are the ones whom we love?

202
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:22,629
How many people do we love and with how many we have enemity?

203
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:26,295
In Sahajayoga some people have gone very deep

204
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,960
very deep indeed, there is no doubt about it.

205
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:34,461
But there are many who are still on the peripherry

206
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:37,277
and can't say when these people will be thrown out.

207
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:42,474
Because, I have already told you that, after the year 1990

208
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:51,283
that a new dimension is going to begin

209
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:58,585
and you will have to take a jump

210
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:10,360
to get down from this state, to settle down in that new dimension.

211
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:12,914
Like a wheel when it moves

212
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:19,947
on reaching a point, it moves forward.

213
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:26,482
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is also going to progress collectively.

214
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,997
And to stay in this dimension

215
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:33,522
the very first thing needed within us is purity

216
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,856
filled with humility.

217
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,374
You have seen people in this world

218
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,507
who think that they are very pure

219
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:45,002
and morning, evening they will do their prayers

220
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,600
they will not allow anybody to touch them.

221
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,950
We will not eat this.

222
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,176
If he comes they will say,"ok you sit far away".

223
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:55,131
If anyone touches them, they will be terribly angry.

224
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,814
This madness

225
00:18:56,838 --> 00:19:04,646
if you are absolutely clean, absolutely pure

226
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,779
then by touching anybody, by talking to anybody

227
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,650
did you ever become impure?

228
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,113
Because you purify everything

229
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:19,121
it is your nature to purify everything

230
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:23,470
So whosoever you meet you will purify that person.

231
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:26,939
What is there to be afraid of?

232
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:30,816
Why should you condemn  anyone?

233
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,037
 Why should you gossip about others?

234
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:41,157
This is just one sign that your own purity is lacking.

235
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,923
If your purity is complete

236
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:48,153
then in that purity there is the power and brightness.

237
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:58,623
It is so powerful that it can absorb any impurity.

238
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:04,308
As I told you, all the dirt in the sea

239
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:09,048
gets completely one with the sea.

240
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:11,371
The second type of people are those

241
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:16,684
who think only of their own progress.

242
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,566
They think that they have nothing to do with others.

243
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,077
We sit in our house, do Mother's puja, do Her arti.

244
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:29,998
We recognize Her and we want our progress.

245
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:36,187
We have nothing to do with the world

246
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,571
and want to be separated from others.

247
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:44,630
Such people cannot progress

248
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:48,281
because you are a part and parcel of the same body.

249
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:51,103
Imagine if a finger ties itself (with a thread)

250
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,839
and will say that it has nothing to do with anything else

251
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:57,661
and say that “I will stay alone”. It will die

252
00:20:57,685 --> 00:21:00,214
because from where will it get blood?

253
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:03,262
How can the veins function in this?

254
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:07,566
How will it transmit consciousness?

255
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,784
It will remain separated, it will remain neglected.

256
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:16,048
You can try it by tieing a finger

257
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:18,022
and keep it tied for 5 days

258
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:22,710
after that you will see that this finger will not work at all.

259
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:26,275
 it will be totally useless.

260
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,401
Then you will say, "Mother, I do so much puja

261
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:34,579
i recite such a lot of mantras, i work a lot for Sahaja Yoga

262
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:37,386
then why it has so happened?"

263
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,658
Because you are separated, you have moved away.

264
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,314
You have moved away from that Samuhik Shakti (collective power).

265
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,643
Sahajayoga is a collective power.

266
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,276
So, when you go away from this collectivity

267
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:59,659
there only you got separated from the power of collectivity.

268
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,945
So we have to take care of both the things

269
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:11,767
to take care of one’s own power and also be collective.

270
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:16,738
Only then you will get the complete balanced state.

271
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:21,272
But outside you do a lot of work.

272
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:26,455
I have seen some people who have done  a lot of work for Sahajyoga

273
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:34,010
and used to give very good speeches, they would talk well.

274
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:36,403
Then, they made audio recordings of their speeches

275
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,980
and started telling people that you should hear our tapes.

276
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:48,995
And the people started listening to their tapes instead of My tapes.

277
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,180
So much so that, for example that I am sitting here

278
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:56,483
they will come and do Namaskar to the photo but not to Me !

279
00:22:56,507 --> 00:23:02,610
Because they were used to bowing to the photo.

280
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:04,436
They had nothing to do with Me.

281
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:07,968
They had every connection with the photo.

282
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,852
Such kind of very strange people I have seen.

283
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:13,858
Then they also got their own photo printed

284
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:16,076
and were showing that photo to everybody.

285
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,956
saying that i am like this, i am like that.

286
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,914
So, in this way, in all the possible ways

287
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:27,928
they show their own importance .

288
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:30,482
and gradually they fell in such a big ditch.

289
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:31,873
Suddenly!

290
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,410
They did not even understand

291
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,423
and fell apart from Sahajayoga.

292
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:39,783
We do not see them anywhere.

293
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:40,744
People started telling me

294
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,792
" Mother they were great leaders, they were this, they were that".

295
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:46,767
Yes, they were!

296
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:51,014
But where did they go? They went. What can I do?

297
00:23:51,039 --> 00:24:05,502
They just evaporated. Where? Don't know. Why did they go away?

298
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:08,688
Because there is no balance.

299
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:13,157
And when there is no balance

300
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:17,869
 then one will go either to the left or to the right.

301
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:20,063
And as I have told you several times

302
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:24,670
that there are two types of forces within us.

303
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:28,033
By one force we are attracted towards Sahajayoga

304
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:30,907
and with the other force, we are thrown out.

305
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:35,059
For example, if you tie a stone to a rope and swirl it

306
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,864
the stone will keep on moving in a circle

307
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:38,553
till it is connected with the rope

308
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,640
and as soon as it will be separated from the rope

309
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:49,301
suddenly it will be thrown away like a tangent.

310
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:53,820
In the same way many people go out of Sahajyoga.

311
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:54,833
Then people say

312
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:59,254
" Mother, see in Sahajayoga the number of the people has reduced.

313
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:00,735
What can I do?"

314
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,184
But if the number has reduced, it is not a loss to Sahajayoga.

315
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:09,533
 It is their own loss.

316
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:12,850
There is absolutely no loss at all to Sahajayoga.

317
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:21,092
because that which has nothing to do with profit or loss

318
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:25,299
how can it lose something?

319
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:34,021
But, if you want to be benefitted by it, then you try to understand that

320
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:42,882
that Sahajayoga does not need you, you need Sahajayoga.

321
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:47,767
Now, the other meaning of 'yog' is 'Yukti ', means a trick.

322
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:57,554
First, is that there should be connection, but the second is “Yukti”.

323
00:25:57,578 --> 00:26:07,241
This 'Yukti' should be understood. What is this trick?

324
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:12,211
It can be made to understand in 3 ways.

325
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:17,992
First, Yukti is that we must have the knowledge about it.

326
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,481
Knowledge does not mean "Intelligence"

327
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:25,820
but in our fingers, in our hands

328
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:32,206
 inside, the complete awakening of the Kundalini is knowledge.

329
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,678
And when you have this kind of knowledge

330
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:38,422
then you start having more knowledge also.

331
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,898
Many things, which you could not understand (earlier)

332
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:42,783
you start understanding now.

333
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:48,561
Now you understand who is truthful and who is not.

334
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:53,332
And with this knowledge you can awaken the Kundalini of others

335
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:55,717
and then you can even explain to them.

336
00:26:55,845 --> 00:27:04,448
And you can perfectly be one with them.

337
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:11,210
You can communicate with them, talk to them about this knowledge.

338
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:17,078
So, because of this knowledge, you get intellectual knowledge too.

339
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,383
You understand Sahajyoga.

340
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:21,651
Otherwise could anybody understand this earlier?

341
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:29,767
“Ida Pingala Sukhamana Nadi Re, Ek Hi Dor Udaunga”

342
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:36,344
So, this kind of talk Kabira used to do, would anybody understand him?

343
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,471
Did anybody understand Nanaka ?

344
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:43,307
Or did anybody understand Gyaneshwara ji?

345
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:46,248
Nobody understood LaoTsé?

346
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:50,542
The saints are saying something very mysterious and secretive

347
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,165
taking it like that.

348
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:55,926
But after being in Sahajayoga, you started understanding everything.

349
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,808
So, even your intellectual cleverness too increased.

350
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:02,559
That too became more clever. You started understanding it.

351
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,922
It is good that you started understanding it.

352
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,407
And whatever was secret became understandable.

353
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:15,700
Also you have been able to understand everything.

354
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:20,490
The first Yukti is that you have increased your knowledge.

355
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,585
Now what is the second Yukti?

356
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:31,603
That is when you have devotion towards Me.

357
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:40,569
Now when you have this Bhakti, it should do Ananya-Bhakti

358
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:49,624
Means that you have to become one with Me.

359
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:57,986
For example, you start thinking as I think.

360
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,307
For example, today it got delayed.

361
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:04,406
"So I too could have said

362
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:05,989
" I am also very tired, it is so late I was asleep whole night.

363
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:10,150
Now I can't do anything".

364
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:14,708
But I thought that the puja of Navaratri has to be done at night

365
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:17,234
and I had to get this auspicious time only.

366
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,083
This is the auspitious time.

367
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,771
This moment only should this puja be performed.

368
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:28,028
And this should happen and we should do it

369
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:30,432
and we are doing it with such a lot of joy

370
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:32,585
 because this is the auspicious time

371
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,835
and we should be ready for that.

372
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,435
We do not even think about that

373
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:43,673
that we are tired, we did not take rest, nothing.

374
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:47,279
For example, a soldier goes to the battle field

375
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:49,141
and he sees that the enemy is standing in front of him

376
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,024
this is the right time to kill him

377
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:53,172
and at that time only, he should kill that enemy.

378
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:59,216
In the same way, this is the right time for us to do this puja.

379
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,861
So I am sitting here

380
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:02,779
and you should also understand that

381
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:04,646
Mother has chosen this time only

382
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,100
that this is the perfect time for us.

383
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:10,706
So, we should do the puja right at this moment only.

384
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:12,419
But those who are half baked people

385
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,815
will think the other way.

386
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,328
Now we are sitting here since morning

387
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:21,903
We did this, now we are feeling hungry, we have not taken our meals.

388
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:25,978
Children must be sleeping.

389
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:27,975
So, this is not Ananya-bhakti.

390
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:32,486
So, My thoughts are not your thoughts.

391
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,059
The way I think, you don't think.

392
00:30:37,083 --> 00:31:05,462
Anybody's

393
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:13,162
That is not in your thought process.

394
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,616
Sometimes, I think!

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,909
"Mother,even today this man is so bad. He is like this, like that".

396
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:24,059
I say,"No, he’s a very good man, an excellent man

397
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,485
how do you say like that?

398
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,564
How did you say like that?"

399
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:33,331
Then I start wondering, why they are not seeing what I see?

400
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:37,376
If they are seeing through My eyes, they should also see what I see.

401
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,547
But it is not so, they are seeing something else.

402
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:50,033
So, this is not 'Ananya' (one). This is 'Anya' (other).

403
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:55,768
In the same way as My love is there for you

404
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:57,643
and I am satisfied only with one thing

405
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,646
that you have same love for others.

406
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,109
If that thing is not there

407
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:11,815
In that case I feel that it is ' anya' (separated) and not 'ananya' (one).

408
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:20,961
If everybody is a part of My body, then they should become like Me.

409
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:25,719
They should think like Me

410
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:30,293
They should do, what I am doing.

411
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:34,903
Why do they think differently?

412
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:37,236
Why do they think the opposite?

413
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:45,167
From where do these strange thoughts come to their mind?

414
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:47,944
So, this is not 'Ananya' bhakti (devotion).

415
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:58,445
This bhakti is your individual way.

416
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:08,981
So, your thought process, your work and your love

417
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:17,904
it should be just the same as you love Me.

418
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:21,029
And if this is the source of love

419
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:25,838
whatever is in the well, should come out in the bucket.

420
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:28,790
How can anything else come in the bucket?

421
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:31,553
And when something else comes

422
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:41,443
then I feel that they have taken the water from some other well.

423
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:50,136
This is not my bucket.

424
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,617
Now the third yukti is that

425
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:57,156
when i told you the second thing

426
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:03,505
that you keep within you, an Ananya Shakti.

427
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:10,336
Mother, "I am surrendered to You. I am very much surrendered".

428
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,050
So, if you are surrendered, then if I tell you something

429
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:15,694
or explain you something

430
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:24,790
or keep some proposal or something before you

431
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,965
how can the question of refusal arise in that?

432
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:34,344
If you and Me are one, why should this question arise?

433
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,797
Mother has said, "so it is oK".

434
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:40,926
Because, we have become Mother only, how can we say," No"?

435
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:45,234
For example, you can see My eye

436
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:49,697
So, My eye knows that you are sitting in front of Me

437
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,272
because My eyes are Mine.

438
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:54,632
So, whatever is My understanding

439
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:58,497
there is no difference between that and the understanding of My eyes .

440
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,976
It is one and the same thing.

441
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,032
What I am understanding through My intelligence

442
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:07,888
that I am understanding through my eyes also.

443
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:14,733
Then you did't get what is called, 'oneness' with Me.

444
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:21,298
So, this is another yukti, "Mother please come to My heart

445
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:24,216
come into my head, come into my thoughts

446
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,916
come into every moment of my life".

447
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:31,140
Wherever you ask Me, I am available with folded hands.

448
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:35,532
I am ready, but you will have to say

449
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:38,592
and will have to say, with full heart.

450
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:44,660
If you connect with Me with the aim of getting benifitted

451
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,903
even then it is not good.

452
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,041
But once the connection is established

453
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:53,567
then all the purposes will be automatically achieved.

454
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:55,795
You won’t have to do anything.

455
00:35:55,819 --> 00:36:00,159
When all the purposes will be achieved automatically

456
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:05,179
your attention will be in that only.

457
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:08,074
Now the third thing is that

458
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,297
that we are doing this work

459
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:14,464
we have done this work of Sahajyoga.

460
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:19,381
We decorated this, set this right

461
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:25,496
I did this, then you are not a Sahajyogi.

462
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,238
In Sahajyoga, your all karmas(actions) should become Akarmas (non actions).

463
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:40,745
But," I am doing something, I have written this poem i have done this".

464
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:47,564
When, you see it once very subtly,

465
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:54,592
" Do I really think like that, that I have done this

466
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:57,427
does it come to my mind?"

467
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:00,745
That means, my yoga (connection) is not yet complete.

468
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:06,524
When your yoga is complete, you will not think like that.

469
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:08,840
You cannot think at all, thoughts wiill not be there

470
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:09,756
You are in Akarma.

471
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:14,920
 "This is happening, that is happening, all that is happening".

472
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:18,440
You start talking like this

473
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,827
And then we should say that you are at one with Me.

474
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:29,004
Like My hand is doing some work. Does it say," I am doing this".

475
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:34,434
It does not even know that it is doing, it is happening.

476
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,497
[Not Clear]  I am only doing.

477
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,735
But if he starts thinking," I am doing

478
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,352
that means that my hand is cut off.

479
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:45,298
It is not connected.

480
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,599
If it is connected, then he will never feel

481
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:54,475
 that,"I am moving, i am walking, i am holding", he never feels.

482
00:37:54,499 --> 00:38:02,082
And when you feel that I am doing,  then chaitanya says," Do it".

483
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:04,081
And then biggest of all problems starts.

484
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,714
This is third yukti (trick).

485
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:09,873
You should learn that trick, where i am doing something.

486
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,000
For a moment you should introspect.

487
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:16,811
Am i doing. What am i doing?

488
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:19,595
Till you were searching self realization

489
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,743
till then you were doing something

490
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:24,541
because, you had ego.

491
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:30,501
You were single individual, you were in VYASHTI, (alone).

492
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,251
Now when you are in SAMASHTI (collective)

493
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:38,539
when you have come in the collective, you are not doing anything.

494
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,035
You are just a part and parcel of that collective

495
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,296
and that work is being done.

496
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,050
This is the third Yukti that you should understand.

497
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,741
I am trying to tell you all these Yuktis because

498
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:52,971
you have to take a jump now (into the new dimension).

499
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:57,590
In this way, you should always try to introspect.

500
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:59,298
And pay attention to yourself.

501
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:03,831
Right now, it is better to look at oneself

502
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:07,522
and see, am I thinking this?

503
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:09,319
I am thinking for others.

504
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:13,406
Do I think that somebody is much better than me?

505
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,764
And that I should learn something from him.

506
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:22,533
Do I see his qualities or just i see his drawbacks?

507
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,821
If we see the good qualities of others

508
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,018
 and our drawbacks then it’s a very good thing.

509
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,197
Because you can not eliminate the drawbacks of others

510
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,682
You do not have the right to do that

511
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:34,916
Where you have the right, you can take out your drawbacks only.

512
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,018
So, what others have done? Others are like this

513
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:44,706
people having such thoughts are not yet fully settled in yoga.

514
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,953
Simply by seeing what is lacking in me, you can improve.

515
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:50,920
By seeing the bad points of others you can never improve.

516
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:54,042
It is like, you are thinking that in somebody else’s house

517
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,540
These things are bad in their house

518
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,275
these things are bad in their house.

519
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,385
We should know. We should know this Yukti.

520
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:06,541
 If we are in a fix, it is because of our own problems.

521
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:11,278
Sahajayoga is a very great thing. It is a very unique thing.

522
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:13,921
But the drawback we have

523
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:19,390
but the reason that even now we are not able to enjoy it

524
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:23,275
its reason is that there is some or the other drawback in us.

525
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:28,141
And on getting all this

526
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:34,250
if we are able to master this Yukti

527
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:36,370
what will you get?

528
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:41,108
Only Joy! Nirananda! And nothing else!

529
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:45,703
 And then what else do you want?

530
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,108
Your face itself will change.

531
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,697
You will drench only in joy!

532
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:55,343
And today, on My Birthday

533
00:40:55,367 --> 00:41:02,352
I would like that that your birthday too might be celebrated.

534
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,916
That from today, we understand this Yukhti

535
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,496
and fill ourselves with purity, like Shri Ganesha.

536
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:18,373
Only with purity can the wisdom settle down in human beings.

537
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:22,918
Because the other name of love is 'Purity'.

538
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:28,092
But wisdom also means love only.

539
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:31,234
Every thing means love.

540
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:37,824
If you are not able to acquire this wisdom

541
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:41,910
and don't consider 'Love' as your own

542
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:46,726
You are wasting your time by coming to Sahajyoga.

543
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:51,008
Now the time has come as such

544
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:54,001
that everybody has to be united

545
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:57,144
and have to transform ourselves.

546
00:41:57,168 --> 00:42:02,436
We have to transform ourselves, we have drawbacks.

547
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,952
We have to purify ourselves completely.

548
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:11,813
How much you are loving yourself

549
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:15,631
 if your child gets a little bit dirty, immediately you go and clean him

550
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:18,083
because you love him.

551
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:21,724
In the same way, when you will love yourself

552
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:25,836
 you will make all efforts to transform yourself.

553
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:27,939
 How much i have been transformed?

554
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,240
Is this drawback still in me?

555
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:32,619
Am i still like that?

556
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:39,755
And as a result of this transformation

557
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:44,443
there is blessing of that life

558
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:48,636
which cannot be described.

559
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,207
which Kabir said

560
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:54,916
"Aab mast hue, phir kya bole” (Now I am drenched in joy, what shall i say?).

561
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,741
So, you all be in that state of joy!

562
00:42:57,765 --> 00:43:00,154
you all achieve that state of joy!

563
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:04,722
and in that joy, you be joyous!

564
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:15,829
These are My blessings!

565
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:21,745
Music.
