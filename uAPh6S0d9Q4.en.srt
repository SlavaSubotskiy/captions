1
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:06,393
Today is the fourth day of Navaratri

2
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:10,782
and in Navaratri you know that
the puja should be done in the night.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,436
To dispel the darkness,

4
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:21,599
it is very important

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,513
that we bring light into the night.

6
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,560
Today,

7
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:38,640
you are also celebrating my birthday.

8
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:55,094
On this day,

9
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,715
Shri Gauri

10
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,409
after her marriage,

11
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:05,695
created and established Shri Ganesha.

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,693
Shri Ganesha

13
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:16,509
is the source of ‘Pavitra’
(Purity & Holiness).

14
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,722
The first thing that was
spread in this World

15
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,058
was the Purity

16
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:27,448
so that all beings,

17
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:30,512
human beings,

18
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:34,602
who came into this World

19
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,991
can stay protected with the Purity

20
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:44,472
and keep away
from unholy things.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,136
This is why Shri Gauri

22
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:56,701
bathed the whole creation
with the Purity

23
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:03,592
and it was only after that
the rest of creation was initiated.

24
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:09,231
So the most important thing
in our life is

25
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:14,669
to consider Purity as the highest
of all aspects within us.

26
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:22,040
To keep Pure does not mean

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,120
that we take bath, wash ourselves
and make our body alright

28
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:38,193
but it means that we should
clean our Heart.

29
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:43,451
The greatest malady
of the Heart is anger.

30
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,560
Anger is the greatest malady.

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,231
And when this anger
enters into a person

32
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,626
then the Purity within

33
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,916
gets destroyed.

34
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,917
Because Purity is nothing but
’Nirvajya Prem’ (Eternal Love),

35
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,640
the Love that is ever flowing

36
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,366
and does not expect anything
in return.

37
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,827
It is completely satisfied
with its own nature of flowing.

38
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:31,479
It feels disturbed
when it cannot flow.

39
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,920
So Purity means

40
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:41,400
that you fill your Heart with Love

41
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,623
and not with anger.

42
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,741
Anger

43
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,587
is not only our enemy

44
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,226
but

45
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:57,977
also enemy of the whole World.

46
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:03,577
All the wars across the World,

47
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,264
the losses suffered,
they have happened

48
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,800
because of the Collective anger.

49
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:16,637
There are a lot of excuses
for being angry.

50
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,952
“I became angry
because of this”.

51
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,367
“I became angry
because of that”.

52
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,320
Man can search for any excuse
just to be angry

53
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:36,770
but then this same anger
can also lead to such hideous wars.

54
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,706
Anger is the reason behind it.

55
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:44,242
If a Heart is filled with Love,

56
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,651
anger cannot enter it.

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,768
And then even if any anger is shown
it is only because of Love.

58
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,175
When an evil ‘Rakshasa’
(devil) is destroyed,

59
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,990
it is also done out of Love

60
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:16,216
because it stops him from
continuing with his evil actions.

61
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,699
But this is not the job
for human beings.

62
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,326
It is the job of the Goddess which
She carried out during the Navaratri.

63
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,981
So we should enlarge our Heart
and then think,

64
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:35,173
whom do we have such a Love for, that is ‘Nirvajya’ (eternal and unconditional)

65
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:37,030
is ‘Nirmam’ (Detached),

66
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,910
without any of “this is my son,
this is my sister,

67
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:42,432
this is my home, this is mine”.

68
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:48,500
Whom do we have such a Love for?

69
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,600
Do we Love someone like that?

70
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,262
You have reached a much higher state
than that of a human being,

71
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:05,368
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi and
you are united

72
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:10,520
with this subtle power of Love
Love of God Almighty.

73
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,240
This Power is continuously
flowing within you,

74
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,295
it is nourishing you,

75
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:21,059
it is supporting you,
it is enriching you.

76
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:26,767
It motivates you all the time.

77
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,649
It protects you

78
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:36,799
and fills you with the essence
of sweet Love.

79
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,469
You have been united with
such a graceful Power

80
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:54,176
but how much place do we really
have in our hearts for It,

81
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,126
this we need to evaluate.

82
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:04,576
We do have Love for our Mother
in our Hearts,

83
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,534
it is true.

84
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,832
All of us Love Mother

85
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,101
and because of that Love

86
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,320
you are feeling
Joyful and Blissful.

87
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,542
But there are two more kinds
of Love which we should have,

88
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:30,989
only then the Love for Mother
will be complete.

89
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:36,818
The first is where we have
the Love for ourselves

90
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,199
that we are Sahaja yogis.

91
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,711
We have achieved our powers
in a ‘Sahaja’ (Spontaneous) manner

92
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,702
but now we need to understand
how to go ahead.

93
00:07:51,623 --> 00:08:00,599
Many people do a lot of work
for spreading Sahaja Yoga

94
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,960
which we can call
as horizontal movement.

95
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,305
Equally spreading in all directions
parallel to the plain of Earth.

96
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:15,190
These people do not look
at themselves

97
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:18,583
and therefore cannot get
to the vertical movement

98
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:22,484
needed for their spiritual ascent.

99
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:26,947
Outside they can do a lot.

100
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:32,295
They will run around
and work a lot,

101
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,559
meet everyone

102
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,374
but they do not pay attention
to attaining the Powers within.

103
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,752
Also there are many who pay
more attention to the Powers within

104
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:46,318
and neglect the Powers outside,

105
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,626
so they do not achieve a balance.

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,638
And when people only move outwardly,

107
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:58,349
the Powers within begin to diminish

108
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,258
and with this diminishing

109
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:07,030
they get to a state where they
drown into the Ego.

110
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,392
Then they start thinking:

111
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,458
"Look, how much we have done
for Sahaja Yoga,

112
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,897
how hard we are working
for Sahaja Yoga."

113
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:24,593
A new life starts for such people

114
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,430
which is not at all suitable
for Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,638
They start thinking about themselves,

116
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,680
that we are very important
and that we should be respected.

117
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,880
What we call as Self-importance.

118
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:46,138
So everywhere, they want their
importance to be considered,

119
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:51,279
they try to show their importance
in everything,

120
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,954
show their specialities,

121
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,800
put themselves in the front
but a hollowness settles within.

122
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:09,331
Then they get shocked and surprised
that they have become sick,

123
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,041
that they have become mad,

124
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,019
some great
misfortune has befallen.

125
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:23,622
Then they say ‘But Mother, we were
completely surrendered to you,

126
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,638
then how did this happen?

127
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:36,299
how did we get into this?
how did this mess occur?’

128
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:43,581
You are yourself
responsible for this,

129
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:47,113
for moving away and getting lost.

130
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,196
Such a person

131
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:55,560
becomes one sided and cannot form
relationships with others.

132
00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:00,400
The only relationship
they have is

133
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,050
‘how we can order people around
and show our superiority’

134
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,147
and in this showing off they
feel important.

135
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:14,416
They should be in the front,
they should be given importance

136
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,231
and if others
do not give them importance

137
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,770
then it is considered
as a sign of disrespect.

138
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,126
It continues to the extent
that they will forget completely

139
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,685
that this is work of Mother,

140
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:33,335
and they should also
contribute to it.

141
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,369
In this way, I see that

142
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:41,275
in Rahuri, in Bombay and elsewhere,

143
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,410
such people suddenly came up

144
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,251
and started feeling very important.

145
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:54,129
And then over there neither ‘Aarti’
was performed

146
00:11:55,458 --> 00:12:01,425
nor did they have the desire
to clean My photograph.

147
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:05,911
But at least they did not use
their own photograph.

148
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,922
So much of self-importance,
bragging about themselves,

149
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:17,622
with that bragging they felt superior,
separating themselves from the rest,

150
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:21,602
not to ask anybody about anything,
‘we will do everything’.

151
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:27,530
Then the quarrels began
and separate groups were formed.

152
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,055
Because the thread
with which you are all bound together

153
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,256
is that of your Mother.

154
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:39,648
So if you remain bound to it
and remember all the time

155
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,415
that we are all children
of one Mother,

156
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:48,053
there is no one superior or inferior,
nor do we do any work,

157
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,696
it is the ‘Param Chaitanya’ which
does all the work,

158
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,830
we really do not do anything.

159
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,123
But when this feeling is lost

160
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:04,046
and a sense of being great comes in
that we have done this and that,

161
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,648
we will do this,
we will do that,

162
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,183
then

163
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,057
the ‘Param Chaitanya’ says,
Alright do what you want to do!

164
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,978
Go wherever you want to!

165
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,879
You want to go to hell
then go ahead!

166
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:24,367
You want to wipe yourself out,
get wiped out!

167
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,343
You wish to destroy yourself,
go ahead!

168
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,982
Do whatever you want to do!

169
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:37,663
It won’t stop you
because it respects your freedom.

170
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,702
If you want to go to heaven,
there is a provision for it

171
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:46,642
and if you want to go to hell, there
is a provision for that also.

172
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,588
But in Sahaja Yoga,
there is one more big Condition.

173
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,304
One very big condition.

174
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:56,524
We are a Collective

175
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,628
‘Virata Shakti’ (Universal force).

176
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:03,366
We are not individuals.

177
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:08,019
We are all part and parcel
of the same body.

178
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:13,591
So if an individual or few become
like this who form own groups

179
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:18,388
then just like malignancy in
cancer where one cell starts growing,

180
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:25,840
similarly even one person can grow to
eclipse the whole of Sahaja Yoga

181
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,759
and all our efforts
can then go waste.

182
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,953
We should learn from the Sea

183
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,420
which remains at the lowest level

184
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:46,928
and allows all things,
all rivers to merge into it.

185
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,113
And without the Sea this
World cannot exist.

186
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,782
It allows itself to be heated up

187
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,280
to form vapors and sends
a blessing of rain into the World.

188
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,536
Its Humility

189
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:11,750
is the sign of its depth,

190
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:20,243
And in that Humility there is
no superficiality of any kind.

191
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,649
From the lowest level, accepting,

192
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:27,033
integrating & purifying everything,

193
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:30,234
to make vapors and give rain.

194
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,600
And then the same rain

195
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,903
falls into the rivers and comes
running back towards the Sea.

196
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:44,592
And the recognizance of this Sea!

197
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:50,535
If you have gone to any Sea beach
and looked at all the coconut trees,

198
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:55,973
you will find them
always bent towards the Sea,

199
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,131
such strong winds blow,

200
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,857
whatever may happen,

201
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,223
but they never turn away
from the Sea.

202
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,650
Because they know, it is the Sea.

203
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,982
Our Hearts will become as large
as this Sea

204
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,393
only when this Humility and Love
will come into us.

205
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,478
But if we want to give
importance to ourselves

206
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,985
and consider ourselves
as something special,

207
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:30,552
In this the problem is that

208
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:33,638
the ‘Param Chaitanya’
will cut us away. ‘Go!

209
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,599
You consider yourself important!
Go away!’

210
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,918
Just like someone cuts the nails
and throws them away,

211
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:43,346
in the same way you will
be thrown on one side.

212
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:47,458
That will indeed be very sad
and painful for Me.

213
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:51,670
If there are any more people who feel
that ‘we do a lot of work,

214
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:54,861
that we did this work,
we did that work’

215
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:59,177
they should immediately cool down,
step into the background

216
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,239
and introspect.
Do we meditate?

217
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,788
Are we really in meditation?

218
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,095
How deep are we?

219
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,912
And then,
Whom do we Love?

220
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,253
Who all do we Love?

221
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:20,242
How many do we Love and
with how many have we become enemies?

222
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:26,672
Some people in Sahaja Yoga
have gone very deep,

223
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,807
very deep and settled down,
there is no doubt in it.

224
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,528
But there are others
who are still on the periphery

225
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,359
and when they may be thrown out,
cannot be said.

226
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,453
As I have already told you before
that after the year 1990

227
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:47,038
a new dimension will open up

228
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:55,925
and you will have to take a leap

229
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:02,638
so that you can get out
of the current state

230
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,773
and catch hold of the new one.

231
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,154
Like the wheel,
when it rotates,

232
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:15,234
it comes to a point

233
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:19,890
and then slips ahead.

234
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:23,316
In the same manner
this movement of Sahaja Yoga

235
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,743
will become Collective

236
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,400
and to stay in it the first
thing we should have is

237
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,304
complete Purity inside

238
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,265
which is filled with Humility.

239
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,111
As such you see a lot of people
in this World,

240
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,399
who think that they are Pure,

241
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,843
they meditate day and night,

242
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:48,906
they do not allow anyone to touch
them, they will not eat particular food,

243
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,959
when someone comes they ask him
to sit away

244
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,137
and if someone touches them
they are upset.

245
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,367
All this is madness!

246
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:01,129
If you are really Clean,

247
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,784
if you are really Pure

248
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,862
then in touching anyone,

249
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,744
in talking with anyone,

250
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:13,242
impurity can never come in

251
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:16,278
because you purify everything.

252
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,332
Your whole nature is of Purification,

253
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:23,312
so you will purify everyone you meet.

254
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:27,109
Why should there be any kind of fear?

255
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,638
What is the need to condemn anyone?

256
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,885
Why should there be a
need to gossip?

257
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:39,326
It is a sign that Purity
within you is less.

258
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:44,764
Because if there is complete Purity
within you then

259
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:48,015
in that Purity there is a power
and intensity.

260
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,944
And it is,

261
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:59,149
so powerful that it can suck in
any kind of impurity.

262
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:07,163
Like I said before how everything
gets integrated in the Sea.

263
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:15,537
Now there are others who
only think of their own progress.

264
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,700
They think ‘why should we concern
ourselves with others?

265
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:24,241
We sit within our four walls
and worship Mother,

266
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:27,237
we do Her Aarti, we follow Her!

267
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:29,684
and we just want our ascent
to take place,

268
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:33,004
we have no concern
with the rest of the World!’

269
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,809
and they keep themselves away.

270
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,091
Such people also

271
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,017
cannot progress

272
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,236
because you are all part and parcel
of the same body.

273
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:51,956
Please understand, if there is
a finger which ties itself and says

274
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:55,347
‘I do not want to have anything to do
with the rest and I will stay alone’.

275
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:57,616
Then such a finger will die out.

276
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,650
Because how will blood flow into it?

277
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,767
How will the nerves work in it?

278
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,742
How will the awareness flow into it?

279
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,593
It will remain cut out!

280
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:11,492
It will be left out!

281
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:15,966
You can try this on your finger.

282
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:21,638
Tie it for five days and you will realise
that the finger no longer works.

283
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,737
It will no longer be of any use.

284
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:30,446
Then you will say
‘Mother I do so many pujas,

285
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:34,726
I pray to you so much,
I do so much of work

286
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,647
then why is my condition like this?’

287
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:41,116
Because you are disturbed!
Because you have lost your way!

288
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:44,221
You have moved away
from the Collective.

289
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:47,377
Sahaja Yoga represents
the Power of the Collective

290
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:51,080
and the moment you move away
from the Collective

291
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:56,017
then you are no longer connected
to this Power.

292
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:03,162
So we have to pay attention
to both the aspects.

293
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:07,000
We should support our ascent within

294
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:10,337
and also be an active part
of the Collective.

295
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:15,480
Only then there will be
a complete balance within.

296
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,467
But you do a lot of work outside.

297
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,233
I have seen people who did a
lot of work for Sahaja Yoga

298
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,303
and used to give very

299
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:33,832
good speeches,
used to talk well.

300
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:37,233
Then they recorded those
speeches on the tape.

301
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,441
and began asking others
to listen to it.

302
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:45,020
Then the people left My tapes and
started listening to their tapes instead.

303
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:52,543
And their condition was such
that like I am sitting here,

304
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:56,514
they will do namaskar to My photo
but not to Me

305
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,448
because they have the habit of
bowing before the photo.

306
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:07,281
As if they have no relationship with Me,
they have only relationship with the photo.

307
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:10,406
I have seen such insane people!

308
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,648
Then they printed their own photos
and began showing it to everybody

309
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:19,496
‘we are like this
and we are like that’.

310
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:26,811
In this and other ways they tried to
impress upon others their own importance.

311
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,591
Doing all this
they fell into a ditch.

312
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,974
Very suddenly! They could
not understand it at all

313
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,910
and in that moment they were
left out of Sahaja Yoga.

314
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:45,209
Others say ‘Mother! These people
were leaders! Yes they were!

315
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:50,319
But then where did they go?
They left! What to do?

316
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:52,585
Absolutely!

317
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:54,319
They disappeared!

318
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,590
Where?

319
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:57,548
I do not know!’

320
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:03,114
So why did these people leave?

321
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:08,108
Because there was no balance

322
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,345
and when there is no balance

323
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:17,384
a person can go to the Left
or the Right side.

324
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,839
As I have said before,
there are two types of Powers

325
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,644
working within us

326
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:27,693
one by which we get
pulled towards Sahaja Yoga

327
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:31,002
and with the other
we are pushed away.

328
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:35,032
If you tie a stone
to the rope and rotate it

329
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,696
then the stone keeps on rotating
till the time it is tied to the rope.

330
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:41,727
The moment it is released,

331
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:48,461
it gets tangentially thrown away.

332
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,870
Many people have gone out
of Sahaja Yoga in this fashion.

333
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:57,828
And then others say ‘Look Mother, the
numbers in Sahaja Yoga have depleted’.

334
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,391
What can I do?

335
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,476
And if they have depleted, it is not
a loss for Sahaja Yoga,

336
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:07,609
it is their loss.

337
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,199
It is not a loss
for Sahaja Yoga.

338
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:20,809
Because for such a thing which is
beyond any gain or loss,

339
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,690
how can it have
any kind of loss?

340
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:28,369
So if you want to be benefitted

341
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:36,880
then you should understand that
Sahaja Yoga does not need you,

342
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,984
it is you who needs Sahaja Yoga.

343
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:46,781
The other meaning of ‘Yoga’
is ‘Yukti’ (Technique).

344
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:54,415
So the first meaning
is the ‘Union’

345
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,625
and the other meaning
is the ‘Technique’.

346
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:00,999
We should understand the meaning
of ‘Yukti’ (Technique).

347
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:04,980
What is this ‘Yukti’ (Technique)?

348
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,552
It can be explained in three ways.

349
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,879
First ‘Yukti’ is to get
the Knowledge.

350
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:20,470
Knowledge does not mean intelligence.

351
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:24,553
To feel (Chaitanya)
on our fingertips, hands

352
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:31,673
and the complete awakening of Kundalini
within us, is part of this Knowledge.

353
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,347
When we get this knowledge then
other knowledges also come to us.

354
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:42,889
A lot of things you could not understand
before, you can do so now.

355
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:48,161
You begin to differentiate between
who is true and who is false.

356
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:53,422
And with this Knowledge you are able
to raise the kundalini of others

357
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:55,710
and you can explain to them

358
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:04,384
and you can be completely
integrated with them,

359
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,043
you can discuss with them,

360
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,350
you can talk with them

361
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,725
and meditate together.

362
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:17,498
So you begin to gain even the
intellectual Knowledge with it.

363
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,487
You understand Sahaja Yoga.

364
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,640
Otherwise could anyone
understand before?

365
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,761
‘Ida, Pingla, Sukhman Nadi Re
(the three channels)

366
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:29,717
Ek Hi Dor Udaunga’
(ascent of kundalini)

367
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:32,532
when Kabira used to speak these poems

368
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:35,009
could anyone understand it?

369
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,149
Could anyone understand
(Guru) Nanaka before?

370
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:43,373
Nobody understood
what Gyaneshwara talked about,

371
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:46,199
neither did they understand Lao tse.

372
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,439
People just considered it all as
some mysterious or secretive talk

373
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,004
and they used to leave it at that.

374
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:56,147
But after Sahaja Yoga
you began to understand all this!

375
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:59,348
So your wisdom and tact increased,

376
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:02,540
you could penetrate
and understand it.

377
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:06,559
It is quite true that you
began to understand it

378
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:10,291
and that Knowledge
which was earlier inaccessible

379
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:13,547
became accessible
and you now know everything.

380
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,768
So this is the first
‘Yukti’ (Technique)

381
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:20,731
through which you have
increased your Knowledge.

382
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,255
So what is the second ‘Yukti’
(Technique)?

383
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,602
That is the one where

384
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:30,451
you should have ‘Bhakti’
(Devotion) for Me.

385
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,714
And when you do that ‘Bhakti’

386
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:38,446
then it should be ‘Ananya Bhakti’.

387
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,604
(Complete devotion)

388
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:46,040
Means that you should achieve
‘Tadatkarita’ (Oneness) with me.

389
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:55,640
You begin to think in the
same way as I do.

390
00:28:58,044 --> 00:29:01,231
Suppose we consider that it has
become very late today.

391
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:04,801
So I could have said
that it is now too late,

392
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:08,918
I have been awake the whole night,
it cannot be done anymore.

393
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:14,816
But I thought, ‘Today is Navaratri
so it has to be done in the night

394
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:17,445
and this is the ordained time
given to us.

395
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:21,734
This is the auspicious time and the
Puja has to be done at this time.

396
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,791
And it should be done
so I have to do it.

397
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,273
And I am doing it with utmost joy

398
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,644
because this is
the most auspicious time

399
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,059
and I should be ready
at that time.’

400
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,350
I don’t think about it at all

401
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:41,557
that I am tired, I have not rested,
nothing of the sort.

402
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:45,503
This is the ordained time.
Like if a warrior

403
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:49,073
has gone to war, sees the enemy
standing before him

404
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:53,107
and it is time to kill the enemy then
he should kill him at that moment.

405
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:57,562
Similarly this is the time at which
I have to be in this Puja

406
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:00,528
so I am sitting here.

407
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:04,409
And you should also think that
Mother has fixed this time,

408
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,581
this is the proper time for us and
we should do the Puja at this time.

409
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,994
But the half-baked people think
just the opposite.

410
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,306
‘We have been sitting here
since morning,

411
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:19,350
we did this,
we are now hungry,

412
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,422
we have not yet eaten,
the children must be sleeping’.

413
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:29,792
Then it is not ‘Ananya Bhakti’
because my thoughts and actions

414
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:32,568
have not come into your
thoughts and actions.

415
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,411
You do not think in the way,
I think.

416
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,973
(30 seconds without talk)

417
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,088
It has not come into your
thoughts and actions.

418
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:18,290
Sometimes I think....
‘Mother this person is so bad

419
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:19,724
he is like this,
he is like that

420
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:23,832
and then I say, no, he is
a good person, he is nice person.

421
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,886
Why are you saying this?

422
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:28,550
How did you say it?’

423
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:32,552
then I am thinking, why are they
unable to see what I can see?

424
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:35,116
If they are looking
through My eyes

425
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:37,146
then they should be able
to see what I see.

426
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:38,477
But it is not so.

427
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:40,730
They are seeing
something else.

428
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:47,426
So it is not ‘Ananya’ (United), they
have become other ‘Anya’ (Separated).

429
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:53,634
As I have Love for
all of you.

430
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:57,539
I become ‘Trupt’ (Satisfied)

431
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,768
when you also Love everyone
in the same way.

432
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,507
If you do not have this within you

433
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,708
then it feels as if

434
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:09,926
they are ‘Anya’
not ‘Ananya’.

435
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:16,408
If they are all part and parcel
of My own Body,

436
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:20,455
then whatever I am,
they have to be just the same.

437
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,833
they should be thinking in
the same way.

438
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:29,733
The way I do things, they should also
do in the same way.

439
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,461
So why do they think differently?

440
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:39,410
Why are they having just the opposite
thoughts? In their mind,

441
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:43,934
where do these strange thoughts
and ideas come from?

442
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:51,010
So it is not ‘Ananya Bhakti’,
it is ‘Bhakti’ of a different type!

443
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,716
So our thoughts and ideas,

444
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,093
and our actions

445
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:08,663
and our Love

446
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,244
it should all be expressed
in just the same way

447
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:16,351
as you have Love for Me.

448
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,693
And if It is the
source of Love

449
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,655
then whatever is within the Well
should also flow on the bank (shore).

450
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,357
How can something else appear?

451
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:31,405
And when something else appears

452
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:34,856
then I think that they have
filled the water

453
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:43,352
from the bank of a different well.
This bank is not Mine’.

454
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,815
Now the third point of this
‘Yukti’ is.....

455
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,881
In the second point,
I told you

456
00:33:57,223 --> 00:34:03,280
to keep within yourself
‘Ananya Bhakti’.

457
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:08,178
Mother we are surrendered to You!
We are completely surrendered!

458
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,076
But if you are surrendered,

459
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:16,159
then when I say something or
if I explain something to you

460
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:24,560
or if I put some proposal
in front of you,

461
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,785
then how can the question
of refusing it arise.

462
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:31,249
If you have become One with Me,

463
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:34,808
then how can this question
come up at all.

464
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:36,239
‘Mother has said it!

465
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,977
It is alright because we have become
‘One’ with Mother

466
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,030
so how can we say no?’

467
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:44,125
Now consider that My eye
is looking at you,

468
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,182
so it knows that you are
all sitting here.

469
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:52,320
Because it is My own eye,

470
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,456
so there is no difference

471
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:59,474
between what My eye knows
and what My intellect knows.

472
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,802
What I know through the intellect

473
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,748
is the same as
what I know with My eye.

474
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:11,180
So this ‘Tadakarita’
(Oneness)

475
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:14,372
which should be visible in you,
hasn’t come.

476
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,121
So in this second ‘Yukti’
we should pray that

477
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,686
‘O Mother, please come into my Heart,

478
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,336
please come into my brain,
please come into my thoughts,

479
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:26,998
please come into every part
of my life.’

480
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,687
Wherever you ask Me, I will be
there with folded hands,

481
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,377
I will be there.

482
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,837
But you will have to say it

483
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,983
and say it with all your Heart.

484
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:42,287
If you try to get connected with
Me because of some motive

485
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:46,349
then it is not proper.

486
00:35:46,924 --> 00:35:49,008
But if a connection is established

487
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:52,169
then all desires
get fulfilled by themselves.

488
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:55,773
You will not have to do anything.

489
00:35:55,974 --> 00:35:59,130
And when all your desires get
fulfilled by themselves,

490
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,609
then your whole attention
will be in It.

491
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,155
Now the third point is,

492
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:12,893
‘We are doing this work!
We did this work of Sahaja Yoga!

493
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:16,979
We did this decoration!

494
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:19,056
We did it well!

495
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:21,402
I did it!’

496
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:25,080
then you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

497
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,508
So the ‘Yukti’ of Sahaja Yoga
is that all your ‘Karma’ (actions)

498
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:30,591
should become ‘Akarma’
(non-actions).

499
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,796
‘I am doing something!

500
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,899
I have written this poem!

501
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,793
I have done this!’

502
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:45,838
Once you look at all this very
closely in the subtle,

503
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:50,235
‘Do I really think like this?

504
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,510
Do I really think this
that I did it?

505
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,655
Do such thoughts really come
into my mind?

506
00:36:57,856 --> 00:37:00,700
Then it means that my ‘Yoga’
(Union) is not complete’.

507
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,305
Because when the ‘Yoga’
(Union) is complete

508
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:06,017
then you do not think like this.

509
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:07,852
You cannot think like that.

510
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,710
No such thoughts! You are in
‘Akarmay’(non-doer state).

511
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:13,144
‘This is happening,
that is happening,

512
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:14,917
it is all happening’

513
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:17,732
This is the way
you begin to talk

514
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,519
and then it can be said that you are
completely in ‘Tadakarita’ (Oneness).

515
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:26,105
Consider my hand,
when it is doing something,

516
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,718
it doesn’t say that
‘I am doing it’.

517
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,553
It does not even know
that it is doing,

518
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:33,718
it is all just happening.

519
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:37,342
Whatever movement it has,
I am the one making it.

520
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:40,177
But if it thinks that it is doing it

521
00:37:40,378 --> 00:37:42,407
then it means that My hand
is cut off.

522
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,589
It is no longer attached.

523
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,500
If it is attached will it ever think
that ‘I am moving,

524
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:51,880
I am holding’?
It will never feel like that!

525
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:58,712
And when you have thoughts
like ‘I am doing it’

526
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:01,944
then Param Chaitanya says
‘Go ahead and do’,

527
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:05,684
and then real mess begins to take
place. So this is the third ‘Yuki’.

528
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:07,518
We should learn this ‘Yukti’

529
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,832
where if a thought comes
‘I am doing something’,

530
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:12,800
in that moment you should
introspect ’Am I doing?’,

531
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,018
‘What am I really doing?’

532
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:19,969
Till the time you were
seeking the light,

533
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:24,568
you were doing something
because there was Ego within you.

534
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:30,405
You were a lone Individual,
you were in ‘Vyashthi’,

535
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:32,520
now when you have come
into the ‘Samashthi’,

536
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,702
when you have become
a part of the Collective,

537
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:37,465
then you are not doing anything.

538
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:41,925
You are just a part and parcel
and that work is happening.

539
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,686
Try to understand this third ‘Yukti’.

540
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,765
I am telling you
these ‘Yukti‘ (Techniques)

541
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:49,657
because we have to now
take a great leap.

542
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:56,457
You should try to
introspect like this all the time

543
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:59,448
and keep a watch on yourself.

544
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,552
At this time, it is important

545
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,880
that we should turn
our attention inwards and watch,

546
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,123
but what?

547
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:09,406
‘Am I thinking this?
Am I thinking about someone else?

548
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:13,257
Am I thinking
how he is better than me

549
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:16,140
and that I should learn something
from him?’

550
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:20,918
Am I able to see his good qualities
or do I look at the defects?

551
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:25,942
If you can see the good qualities
in others and own bad qualities

552
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:27,929
then it is very good.

553
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,026
Because you cannot remove
defects in others.

554
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:33,063
You do not have that authority.

555
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:34,931
You have authority to correct
your own defects.

556
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:37,963
‘So what did others do?
Others are like this!’,

557
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:42,415
Those who think like this, their
‘Yoga’ (Union) is not yet complete.

558
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:46,340
‘What are the defects within me?’

559
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,688
Only by keeping this watch you
can correct yourself.

560
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,800
You cannot correct it by
watching others.

561
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:53,779
It is as if you are thinking about

562
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,295
the defects in the house
of another person.

563
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:01,602
But we should know, we should
understand this ‘Yukti’,

564
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:06,688
that we are ourselves responsible
for our half-baked condition.

565
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,583
Sahaja Yoga is
very unique and great.

566
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:16,149
But the problems which are coming
in us or that we are

567
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:22,003
still not able to enjoy It completely
is because of the defects within us.

568
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,033
And all this,

569
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,049
when you achieve all this,

570
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,433
when you have learned
these ‘Yukti’ (Techniques),

571
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:36,063
what will you gain?

572
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,761
Only ‘Anand’ (Joy),

573
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:41,114
‘Niranand’ (Complete Joy)
and nothing else.

574
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,213
And then what else
do we need?

575
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:51,137
Your whole countenance will change
and you will be just filled with joy.

576
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:55,255
Today on this occasion of
my Birthday celebration,

577
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:02,207
I would like that we also
celebrate it as your Birthday

578
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:06,632
that today onwards we will understand
this ‘Yukti’ (Techniques)

579
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:11,248
and fill ourselves with
Purity and Holiness

580
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,226
just like Shri Ganesha.

581
00:41:13,715 --> 00:41:17,548
And with this Purity,
Wisdom comes into a person.

582
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:22,361
Because Purity is another name
for Love,

583
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,135
so Wisdom also means Love,

584
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:30,538
so everything is Love.

585
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:32,920
And if you

586
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:36,641
cannot achieve Wisdom

587
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:41,113
and if you cannot become this Love

588
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:45,534
then you are wasting your time
in Sahaja Yoga.

589
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:50,391
Now a time is coming,

590
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,114
when all of us should dissolve
ourselves in it

591
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:57,005
and we should transform ourselves.

592
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:59,425
We have to get transformed,

593
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:01,917
we have to see our defects.

594
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:06,225
We have to make ourselves
completely pure.

595
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:10,729
This is how you can show
your Love for yourself.

596
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,431
If your child gets dirty,
you run and clean the child

597
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,955
because you have Love for the child.

598
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,680
In the same way
once you will Love yourself,

599
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:25,078
you will put yourself into
complete transformation

600
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,826
that how much change
has taken place within me,

601
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:30,215
I still have these faults within me,

602
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,098
I am still like this.

603
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:35,142
And because of this transformation

604
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:41,626
the blessings which come

605
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:47,030
in your life cannot be described
by mere words.

606
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,563
As Kabira has said
‘Jab Mast hue to fir kya bole’

607
00:42:51,764 --> 00:42:54,779
(When you are in the Blissful state
then what more can you say).

608
00:42:55,002 --> 00:42:57,693
You all should now
get into that ‘Masti’ (Bliss).

609
00:42:57,894 --> 00:43:04,352
And attain that joyous state
where you become completely blissful.

610
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,855
May God Bless You.
