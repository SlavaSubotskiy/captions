1
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:14,291
One, there is this program that we have bought a land

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:19,900
There, how to do agriculture through Sahaja Yoga, for that there is a research center

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,502
For that we have a Director,  who is Dr Hamid, who will himself be coming and staying here

4
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:29,249
Now in the fields if you put Vibrated water....... He has done this experiment

5
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:31,585
He did not have any thing with him to Vibrate

6
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:34,067
And they do not have water from the well , whereas we have water from wells here

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,941
He put the ring which had my photo into the tap

8
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,379
So he showed....

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,625
now there were two type of Hybrid and two type of seeds

10
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:49,325
so when he grew the Hybrid, it grew so big

11
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,284
Without Hybrid it became like this

12
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,755
And without Hybrid, on that he put Water from Sahaja yoga

13
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,365
and they became so big. So he conducted many experiments like this

14
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,278
Now acid rains happening there

15
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:03,444
On Acid rains he has conducted experiments using vibrated water

16
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:07,900
You will be surprised that on trees which are more than 60 years of age there is no effect

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,123
but the rest of the trees are all flourishing

18
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:11,814
They have this very big problem

19
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:16,384
So there is this very big work and for that he has made many a Charts and all of them are coming

20
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:17,435
in which country?

21
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:19,405
In Agriculture , over here only, in India

22
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,956
All the work will happen in India only,

23
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,719
you see this is one very big work that agriculture over here becomes OK

24
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,073
Now if you go and see the agriculture of our Sahaja yogis and you will say where has this come from?

25
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:31,582
these grains which are like pearls!

26
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:36,289
And these grains which are kept in storerooms also, rats dont eat it

27
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,207
rats dont touch it.... leave them in the open

28
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:40,318
Everything else they will eat, but they will not eat those

29
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:43,166
And each of the fruits if you will see, like Papaya...

30
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:48,184
if you see the papaya of Sahaja yoga, then you will not believe that they are Papays's of India

31
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:50,596
So sweet and they last for very long

32
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:54,454
So this thing we have to do to improve the prosperity of our country

33
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,348
this is one of the big work being done

34
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,405
All problem !

35
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:13,490
now if you have any poor people….I would like to tell another thing ……about poor people

36
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,049
Now see, our country is an agriculture based country

37
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:21,357
what we call as farm based people, they are more in our country

38
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:24,229
With the help of Sahaja Yoga what happens is that,

39
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:30,983
sometimes the agriculture produce can increase sometimes 10 times or even 20 times

40
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:35,342
each each Sunflower grows so big , with the help of these vibrations

41
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:37,245
And a lot more can happen

42
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:41,299
So due to this, a sahaja Yogi who is there , becomes rich

43
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:47,197
Because he has the best seeds, the best agriculture produce

44
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:49,460
and he is better off than most other people

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,950
So the countries which is agriculture based, for them Sahaja Yoga is an amazing thing

46
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,898
Even Milk... our Indian cows also gives about 4 to 5 (ser) milk at the maximum

47
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,491
now she starts giving around 12(ser)

48
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,320
And we don’t need to buy hybrid seeds

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,517
Just vibrating the normal seeds solves the problem!

50
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:11,799
So you don’t need to be a slave of any company

51
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,676
So in this way, the problems of our country, specially our country, can be solved.

52
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,041
There are many such things

53
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,898
In Sahaja Yoga one can understand. which are the special things we have in our country

54
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:23,415
What all can be sent abroad

55
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,443
You get a subtle understanding about this.

56
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:30,000
And with this you see how so many people are sending things abroad.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,062
What all is being done

58
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:33,181
And you all will also prosper

59
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:37,106
because you get this subtle understanding

60
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:44,582
In every way due to an individual personality become a part of the Whole

61
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:50,538
all the hidden qualities which are within him starts getting enlightened

62
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,886
Big big musicians are in Sahaja Yoga

63
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:56,415
Big big artists are in Sahaja Yoga

64
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:59,841
Our commander-in-chief is also in Sahaja yoga

65
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:05,580
In this way, this thing is like this that when a person achieve this state

66
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,212
he achieves a state called " Parama Pad" (the supreme status)

67
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:10,475
Every-time we say " parama pad dijiyo means please bless us with the supreme status

68
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,408
This is the "Parama Pad" the Supreme Status

69
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:19,134
Because this body is filled with energy you don’t need.

70
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,327
Actually, this is the first time the energy is filling you all.

71
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,745
Then you give vibrations.

72
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:28,087
In Rahuri [Maharashtra state] there called university there they have experimented

73
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:33,909
In the University for first time they have
experimented in agriculture university with these vibrations

74
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:41,077
They have found that the growth of all this wheat was 10 ten times more

75
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:44,620
They have found that the fruits that came out of it were beautiful

76
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,873
and they were so tasty and so lasting

77
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,796
They found that when the cow was given vibrated water

78
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:55,907
Indian cow started giving milk like an Australian cow

79
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,783
But I cannot write a guarantee check for you

80
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,283
That is one thing.

81
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:03,289
So all the miseries so called, will drop out

82
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,846
The second power of the second center has the power of creativity

83
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:21,087
You get the creativity, which is living

84
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,503
So far you never had

85
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,207
we take everything from the nature

86
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:30,541
We have never given anything to the nature

87
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:37,417
When this center is enlightened then when you give.. say vibrations to a field of wheat

88
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:42,958
In India they have done experiments in many universities of Agriculture

89
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:48,193
and we have many scientists are doing it, they are Sahaja Yogis

90
00:05:48,193 --> 00:06:00,952
and they have found out that the same seed if it is vibrated can produce five times more wheat

91
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:09,217
not only that but they stored that wheat in a big store where there were other things stored up

92
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:17,578
And the rats did not touch those bags, Gani bags which contained those wheats.

93
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,000
It’s worth seeing all these

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,509
There were cows, Indian cows do not give milk as much as the milk as much as other cows

95
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:33,034
like, you can say New Zealand or Australian cows

96
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:37,211
but these two type of foreign cows are extremely aggressive

97
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:42,618
and their milk make people very, very aggressive

98
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,727
and the taste is not so good

99
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:47,651
But Indian cows give very nice milk

100
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:50,947
It doesn’t make people very aggressive and the taste is very good

101
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:53,593
But the Indian cows when they were given vibrations,

102
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,590
supposing they were giving five seers of milk

103
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,952
they have started giving at least ten  seers or twelve  seers,

104
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:06,477
not so much as these aggressive ones have give

105
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:12,527
but their longevity increased

106
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:23,666
This is how you start giving these enlightened dimensions to things.

107
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:40,508
Material development is much faster and in balance when you get Self Realization

108
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:45,103
These vibrations help agriculture very much

109
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:51,543
We have a scientist, Dr. Hamid, in Austria

110
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,404
who has experimented with vibrations

111
00:07:54,404 --> 00:08:02,647
and has found out that even non-hybrid seeds give you greater yield than the hybrid seeds

112
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:12,724
In my own field I sowed about 60 kilos of rice in one acre of land

113
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,949
And they told me “It’s a special rice. It won’t grow here”

114
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,455
But it turned out to be 1700 kilos

115
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:24,076
One of the best rices

116
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:28,930
And even the sunflower was so big, two feet diameter

117
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,234
You could not lift; one person could not lift

118
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:35,669
Giving oil six to ten times more!

119
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,580
Do you know, from your country, you are exporting sweet peas

120
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,592
and also sort of pulses to India

121
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:49,017
Chickpeas also. Millions tones of....

122
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,784
If you vibrate them…

123
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:52,753
Better do it fast

124
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:58,518
If Indians start doing it, they may not import

125
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,806
Now our country is of farmers so, I told everyone that do Sahaj yoga,

126
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:25,548
use vibrated water for farming,

127
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,514
come to Sahaj yoga by which your yield can increase up to ten times.

128
00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,805
But people do not listen.

129
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:38,153
Many Agriculture University people also did big research

130
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:42,148
and the news spread everywhere that such a thing can happen.

131
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:53,286
Even from Austria a very famous Mr. Hamid, Dr. Hamid has come for this.

132
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,505
He was an advisor in UNO.

133
00:09:55,608 --> 00:10:00,858
He also did experiments and explained to everyone

134
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:06,041
but don’t know what’s the matter that this doesn’t go into the heads of people.

135
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,726
As if their brains are not alright.

136
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:11,894
Try to do farming this way and see for yourself.

137
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:15,329
If you see ten farms and one farm is full of greenery

138
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,998
then understand for sure that this is a farm of some Sahaj yogi.

139
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,752
In everything, also we have seen, in animal husbandry.

140
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:27,795
We did experiments and were told that one cow gives up to ten litres of milk.

141
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:30,571
Surprisingly, it’s about our Indian cow

142
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,284
and even the seeds which they use are not the seeds brought from the shops or anywhere

143
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,058
but commonly used seeds,

144
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,539
so much was produced from that seed,

145
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,030
but nobody is ready to listen.

146
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:49,462
In this India, if you call a newspaperman,

147
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,767
they only notice that there was a carpet spread out at your place,

148
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:56,856
there was a lamp was illuminated at your place.

149
00:10:56,937 --> 00:11:01,161
There is nothing beyond that. They don’t see anything beyond that.

150
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,922
They don’t hear anything,

151
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:08,379
they don’t write anything instead they write some silly things which has no meaning.

152
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,404
We have brought such a great thing before you,

153
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,425
at least listen to something.

154
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,960
But they are not ready to listen to anything.

155
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,587
Don’t know what kind of brain people have here!
