1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,410
It is the vital energy, which has

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,280
 one electromagnetic energy that you have.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,540
 What we call as a “Prana”

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,860
 It is the energy from 5 elements.

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:36,580
 It has the energy by which we are today human beings from amoeba

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,640
 and it has the energy which creates desires within us.

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,100
 It has the energy that can cure us

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,260
 and redeems us

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:16,280
 and the energy that can give us powers so we can do living work.

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:37,400
 Sahaja yoga is with that energy which is in totality complete consciousness,

11
00:01:48,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 and it is a special time today. You can say in modern times, and there are so many people who are trying to think beyond,

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 we can say it is meta modernism,

13
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,040
 no, no, meta modernism

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:37,880
 and that is something which shows the wisdom of people who understand that we have to go beyond

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 and they are not satisfied with what they are but they have to go beyond

16
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:16,840
 and there are so many who feel that their awareness is to be expanded.

17
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:38,400
 In this short time as much as possible I am trying to give you a general picture about Sahaja yoga.

18
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,720
 “Saha” means “with”, and “ja” is born,

19
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,400
 so it is born with you to have this union with that all-pervading power, Sahaja you have.

20
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,840
 It works on all living beings

21
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,760
 and also on energies.

22
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:41,880
 For example, you can improve your agriculture in Sahaja yoga 10 times more,

23
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,400
 you can improve your ecological problem through Sahaja yoga,

24
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:16,860
 you can make your animals much more healthier through Sahaja yoga

25
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,860
 and you yourself become so dynamic

26
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,280
 and so compassionate

27
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:57,600
 that a scientist becomes a person who works only with all the understanding of limitations of science

28
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,060
 and helps to create a new world.

29
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:22,560
 I must say all the scientific discoveries have helped Sahaja yoga greatly.

30
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,600
 Supposing there were no aeroplanes I did not have come to see you

31
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,360
 if there were no microphones I could not have talked to you

32
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,060
 and these microphones also carry vibrations.

33
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,740
 Even on television one can give realization to people.

34
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:19,400
 So all these discoveries you have made has been of such a great help to Sahaja yoga.

35
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,600
 We have developed the watches to save time,

36
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,960
 we save our time to waste it mostly,

37
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:59,680
 and after self-realization, we use it for our spiritual ascent and spiritual growth, growth through meditation.

38
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:23,400
 So I am very much thankful to you all scientists for making these devices which have made it possible to spread Sahajayoga all over the world.

39
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,400
 The knowledge of Sahaja yoga is very deep,

40
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,100
 our civilization has grown like a big tree,

41
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,240
 but knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots

42
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,600
 and if you do not have the knowledge of the roots this great development will be one day under a shock.

43
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:31,220
 So it is important for us to know the knowledge of the roots if we have to survive

44
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,900
 and to enjoy the blessings of science.

45
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:58,040
 I am sorry in this short time I cannot say much but I will be very happy to answer your questions if you have any.

46
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,840
 As a scientist, you have to understand everything whatever you do,

47
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,640
 if somebody cures you and cannot explain how

48
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,120
 then you should not accept as a scientist.

49
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,240
 but I know that what happens.

50
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,600
 This is something which is not dealt with by scientists so far,

51
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,660
 only in the scriptures they have talked about the soul,

52
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:44,300
 now soul, whatever I am telling you, again, you should accept it as a hypothesis.

53
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:03,740
 Now soul is a composition of 5 elements, the causal of 5 elements

54
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,940
 which is placed on the back side of our...it’s an energy form, it’s an energy form

55
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:25,840
 and is placed on the backside of our spinal cord in 7 loops…

56
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:46,500
 after self-realization you can even see the all-pervading power like small commas shining like light,

57
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,860
 also you see a kind of loops circular things

58
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,860
 and the Sahaja yogis ask Me: what is this?

59
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,560
 I told them these are dead souls.

60
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,440
 Now for example we talk of psychosomatic diseases,

61
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:49,980
 also doctors have reached a certain point of understanding that most of the psychosomatic diseases

62
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:59,600
 are caused by something that comes from our collective subconscious.

63
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:25,440
 For example, cancer they say is triggered by a protein 53 and 58. It’s a name they've got.

64
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:53,180
 And they say that it comes from the area which is built within us since our creation,

65
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:10,780
 now, this area which is built within us is the area which we call as collective subconsciousness,

66
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:38,780
 so all the plants which have gone out of the circulation of evolution or who have gone out of the circulation are all existing in that area of collective subconscious,

67
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:13,720
 so when a person who practices what we call as black magic or mesmerism also uses the dead souls

68
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,820
 which are around to captivate you.

69
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,640
 And people do mesmerize without knowing what effects it will have on human beings.

70
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:53,500
 Now what happens that if you put any such spirit, it can be without the knowledge

71
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:04,400
 of the person who is doing it automatically. It becomes like a [ ] and then the spirit gets out to your system,

72
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:29,500
 now recently they have found out in the science, scientific research that we have all got receptors

73
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:39,100
 and in the receptors these seven loops that I am telling you about are reflected exactly the same way

74
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,740
 I have seen..if you have seen the picture in the same that you see.

75
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:12,100
 And when there are on these loops if there is any effect then what you call as dopamine is created.

76
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:25,280
 Dopamine is a kind of a chemical which gives you epilepsy, it can give you madness can give you all mental problems also other virus and cancer, psychosomatic.

77
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:51,220
 So I, I didn’t know that I would talk to scientists otherwise I would have brought these papers which I have got from America.

78
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:10,820
 So we had about 10 people yesterday, who came from the same gentleman and were suffering from many diseases.

79
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,440
 Some had their hands stuck like that they couldn’t walk, some children suddenly stopped talking,

80
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,080
 some got their eyes completely scooped in, some got the brain paralysis.

81
00:19:46,880 --> 00:20:02,280
 So what happens that you can put one of their or many of these dead spirits on your back on the soul,

82
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,300
 and they take over

83
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,840
 and when they take over when they try to assert their personality,

84
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,420
 so for the time being one may feel elated because there are so many personalities acting for a while,

85
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,800
 but after sometime that person becomes exhausted and they recluse...

86
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:12,980
 This is followed by many false gurus in India, we know about it very well because just

87
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,840
 this black magic is too much in India.

88
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:37,540
 But mainly what one has to know, I would say that as a Mother I would say what did you get out of it?

89
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,620
 Only temporary curing is not the aim of life,

90
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,460
 but you have to be empowered and you have to have full knowledge as to what you are going to be.

91
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,600
 In Sahaja yoga you know all about the centres and it can be good to you.

92
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,700
 You can even see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the kundalini,

93
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,320
 this power which connects you to the mains.

94
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,900
 You can see also sometimes the rising of the kundalini

95
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,880
 you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, the actualisation of it,

96
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,980
 and you can feel the all-pervading power.

97
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:21,320
 You may be a doctor may not be a doctor but you can give diagnose to others what centres are in trouble.

98
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,960
 There are three channels

99
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,860
 which look after the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system,

100
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,280
 and you can control them,

101
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,020
 you can control your parasympathetic nervous system,

102
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,340
 you can raise the kundalini of others,

103
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,240
 you can cure others,

104
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,440
 yourself you feel extremely peaceful, joyous and happy,

105
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,980
 because you develop a new dimension of collective consciousness which Jung has written.

106
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,580
 So you become complete knowledgeable like a laboratory you know everything,

107
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:53,500
 it is not just "ah, it is happening. I don’t know how happening" - nothing of that kind...everything can be explained,

108
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,320
 everything becomes logical,

109
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,600
 so anything that just cures you is not sufficient,

110
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,340
 in India this art is very well developed

111
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,080
 but we know about it so much that we now don’t go to any false people,

112
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,180
 so now they are exported all to America,

113
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,440
 They are very gullible

114
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,820
 Americans are very gullible people,

115
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,540
 and these people have only interest in money they are money makers.

116
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,800
 Now it’s a living process,

117
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,300
 how can you pay for a living process,

118
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,520
 how much do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

119
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,820
 These people have all their interest in money,

120
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,500
 and not in giving you the powers

121
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,940
 and the knowledge

122
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,460
 because they haven’t got it.

123
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,300
 So first of all you must see

124
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,540
 what are the disciples like?

125
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,280
 What do they do?

126
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,740
 What sort age they are? What sort of body they have?

127
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,360
 How do they talk?

128
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,540
 What is their health?

129
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,180
 Do they know about all this?

130
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,620
 Can they explain it?

131
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
 How is their own life?

132
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,120
 You can find out.

133
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,640
 They have to be honest

134
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,880
 and they have to be compassionate,

135
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,620
 so be careful,

136
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:14,240
 so many will come once you have lots of money, there will be a market,

137
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,280
 so before anything happen, be careful.

138
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,180
 I am a Mother and you have asked me the question I have to tell you the Truth.

139
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,600
 Eighteen years back I have told this Truth but they would not listen to Me,

140
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,040
 In America I told them about AIDS, I told them about UPI disease is going to come,

141
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,960
 I told them about so many diseases they would not listen and now they are down with it.

142
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,940
 So what can you do if they don’t want to listen to you, you can’t help it.

143
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,000
 If they are bent upon their destruction then what can you do? They have all the freedom.

144
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:41,480
 Or somebody asked me how to go to hell, all types of questions they ask,

145
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,100
 I said take two running jumps and you are there.

146
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,620
 So it is like this,

147
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,900
 For getting your realization you have to first ask for it, I have to respect your freedom

148
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,300
 and it’s not a guarantee that you will get it at first shot.

149
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,660
 But if you are earnest it will work out

150
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:41,240
 and then once you are fully connected, no problems of any kind.

151
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,060
 I found Russians to be very wise people,

152
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:03,320
 and I feel that a day will come when Russians will be most powerful people spiritually.

153
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,940
 The country is not powerful by weapons but by the powerful peoples.

154
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,780
 I have to .. his question is still not answered.

155
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:06,480
 After realization, we become very sensible and satisfied people,

156
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,260
 and we develop a balance

157
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:23,620
 then we realize that the machines are for us and we are not for machines

158
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,060
 so we produce as much as we want,

159
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,860
 and whatever is necessary we produce through machines or we produce through our hands.

160
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,820
 So a balance is.

161
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,660
 As a result of that, the pollution goes down.

162
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,640
 Now in Spain there are five motor factories,

163
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:36,660
 now on the road you will find in car only one person is sitting, in every car,

164
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:52,300
 because so many cars are produced every day, cars are cheap so they buy a car and an ego is saying: now I've got a car!

165
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:16,380
 The father must have one car, mother must have one car, the child must have one car, the grandmother must have one car

166
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,860
 and they never meet each other,

167
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,620
 no rapport, no relationship,

168
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:38,480
 they live with their cars with their pretty girls and with a suitcase.

169
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,380
 So, after realization we become collective,

170
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,920
 there may be three cars but everybody would like to go together in one car,

171
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,060
 they want to live collectively

172
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,300
 because they enjoy each other.

173
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,140
 Now Sahaja yoga is working in forty nations,

174
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,700
 and they want to live in Indian villages,

175
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,840
 And light it with a spark. I mean you cannot do anything there,

176
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:50,400
 but they enjoy it having their baths in the flowing rivers and living in the nature absolutely very happy and comfortable.

177
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:07,860
 They wear few clothes of cotton or pure silk or cotton whatever they can afford, not too many things they don’t have in their house

178
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,180
 like plastics,

179
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,520
 mountains and mountains

180
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,300
 and they don’t know how to destroy it,

181
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,440
 and Sahaja yogis don’t drink,

182
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,600
 so only one glass is sufficient for one man,

183
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,080
 for drinking we have to have one..., another one, another one, another one,

184
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,660
 and too many choices because of ego.

185
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
 In the morning the mother will ask what will you have?

186
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,660
 One child will say this, another this another that,

187
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,540
 and if that is not in the fridge the child will start shouting,

188
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,940
 Formally the mother used to cook for everyone the same thing

189
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,460
 and everybody had to eat that and enjoy it,

190
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,040
 because we have lost our collective enjoyment, we have become like this.

191
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,860
 Now these entrepreneurs are also making fool of us,

192
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,060
 first they will start that you should wear very tight pants,

193
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,600
 so you develop varicose veins,

194
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,940
 so they will say alright make pants with holes in it

195
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,240
 so everybody starts wearing them,

196
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,220
 they go on changing fashions because their machines have to run,

197
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:08,560
 and we have no personality, we all want to be fashionable, what is the need?

198
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
 So we have piles of clothes,

199
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,880
 you go to an English home, as soon as you enter all pile will fall on you first of all.

200
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,200
 So, this matter is only for one purpose,

201
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,280
 is for expressing your love,

202
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,920
 like today we had a birthday,

203
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,680
 so we gave him a tea set,

204
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,480
 and I got some necklaces for all of you,

205
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,260
 and I enjoy very much giving them,

206
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,940
 that’s the only advantage of matter,

207
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,660
 otherwise possessions are headaches.

208
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 So, how ecological problems has come by? Because of greed and lust.

209
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:58,820
 After Sahaja yoga, you get everything beautiful and enjoy everything,

210
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:17,880
 because you feel that this has become a holy water now, everything becomes holy, auspicious,

211
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,200
 only thing which are auspicious, which emit vibrations Sahaja yogis will have it,

212
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,320
 all auspicious things are benevolent

213
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,980
 so the ecological problem is solved.

214
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:10,580


215
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:39,940


216
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:41,340
  So first question is that some diseases can be cured through Sahaja yoga  - as raising the kundalini.

217
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:05,960
 Yesterday there was a lady with multiple sclerosis. And she could not stand on her..

218
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,240
 and we raised her kundalini, she had problems on her centres,

219
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:27,980
 we corrected the centres raised her kundalini, gave her realization and she got alright,

220
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:46,260
 and then she still [ ] that she was sick so she was holding onto the chair

221
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:53,200
 I said now you get up and walk, and she then started walking so fast, everybody saw.

222
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,720
 Most of them get cured,

223
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,700
 but some of them do not.

224
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,680
 Now, first of all, you have to get your self-realization,

225
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,520
 then you have to come to our collective program

226
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,660
 and then you have to master Sahaja yoga

227
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,660
 when you start do it, then you can cure others.

228
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,760
 But Sahaja yoga is not for curing,

229
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,120
 it is for self-realization

230
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,120
 and when you get your self-realization as a bioproduct

231
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:21,820
 then you can become alright because when the kundalini rises She passes through these centres and nourishes them.

232
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:57,700
 Shri Mataji, if there were some psychological research done relating to influence Sahaja Yoga on people?

233
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:09,140
 Is it possible to see the findings of this research? And may I get Your blessing to conduct such research in center of Sahaja Yoga in Moscow?

234
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:03,880
 ...here accepted for research but if you want to do it otherwise you can do it by using Sahaja yoga methods

235
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:19,100
 to cure people who are suffering from psychosomatic diseases or depressions or anything by treating them and then noting down their improvements.

236
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:03,520
 We have here a saint scientist doctor from England, he is here and he can tell you about it.

237
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,540
 And we are all experimenting with many things. Is he here doctor Wells?

238
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:22,560
 Alright, you come and see he is now running seven hospitals, London.

239
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:43,660
 Now we have many doctors here and I think we should meet them who have come from abroad...we should call them.

240
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:59,140
 aap aaiye( you please come), We have doctor Talwar? ..Dr. Talwar?

241
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,540
 Dr Talwar from Delhi.

242
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,080
 Now we have Dr Ramzad Ali,

243
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,680
 He is from the U.K.

244
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,360
 And he is a great student of medicines actually.

245
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,540
 He has done a lot of studies.

246
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,160
 Then we have Dr Neelam,

247
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,420
 from India.

248
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,500
 Then we have Dr Sarah,

249
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:00,480
 then we have got a diplomat from UN, Gregoire.

250
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,320
 Then in Russia, we have got Dr Bogdan.

251
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,320
 Today is his Birthday.

252
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,380
 He has sacrificed his job

253
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,480
 in India and he is now here,

254
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,300
 working it out for Russia.

255
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,260
 We hope to see some sense of scientists also for you from America.

256
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,540
 They’ll explain many more things to you,

257
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,060
 also we will send you some papers that they have written.

258
00:52:49,060 --> 00:53:08,100
 And second - is Sahaja Yoga is universal science, which includes Hatha, Raja and other yogas or it is some new principle?

259
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,160
 I should say I was born with this knowledge.

260
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,160
 The second question is about all other yogas.

261
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:22,660
 Now Hatha yoga is meaning “Ha” and “Tha” meaning the sun and the moon both lines, both energies,

262
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:36,000
 but in modern times the Hatha yoga they are practising is only of one side,

263
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:51,080
 moreover the one who started hatha yoga was known as Patanjali,

264
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,580
 so thousands of years back he’s written a book so big as that so thick,

265
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:22,360
 in that he has written that there are Ashtangas, there are eightfold of yoga, eight aspects, spiritual paths,

266
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:36,000
 out of that yama niyama is the one which is just a wee bit,

267
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,960
 yama niyama, is control and the laws

268
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,540
 and out of that very wee bit are the exercises,

269
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,860
 now we also use those exercises,

270
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:21,620
 but later on throughout he has talked about Sahaja yoga,

271
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,680
 first you get thoughtless awareness and then doubtless awareness.

272
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:44,420
 In those days they used to only have one or two disciples,

273
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,420
 and they cleansed their all centers and then raise their kundalini,

274
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,560
 and it could take years together.

275
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,640
 But now in the Sahaja yoga today,

276
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:31,100
 I have evolved a method by which first you raise the Kundalini somehow,

277
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,380
 and in that little light, give them little light they see what’s the problem with that

278
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,720
 and just tell them how to correct

279
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,280
 so they can correct their own problems.

280
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,660
 In those days people have no time

281
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,000
 and people are very obstinate also

282
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,340
 so now supposing there’s darkness and you are holding the snake in your hand

283
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:36,580
 and I say now there is a snake in your hand, you won’t listen to Me, you won’t throw it away till it bites you.

284
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,940
 You will say it’s a rope,

285
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,020
 so the best thing is to put little light,

286
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,640
 so you see the snake and throw it away yourself.

287
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,420
 This is today’s Sahaja yoga

288
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:13,460
 but it’s the same what he achieved after so many years you can achieve it yourself in a very short time,

289
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:30,840
 and also as we have developed speed I think kundalini has also developed speed.

290
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:50,440
 We call it this as jet times and the kundalini is also a jet kundalini, we call it as a jet, Jet Times, jet. How do you translate this

291
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:11,000
 I am myself surprised, it works en masse.

292
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,500
 Yesterday there were 10,000 people,

293
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:28,060
 and I think 95% of people got realization 95.

294
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:51,380
 But we do tell you exercises when the kundalini rises, then we tell you if there is any physical problem what exercises to be done, it’s all scientific.

295
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:16,100
 But this way these days the way people do hath yoga, they just take all the medicine from the medicine box without knowing what is to be taken without discretion.

296
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,400
 Now another is Raja yoga.

297
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:41,160
 I went down to California and I saw some doctors whom I knew have cut their tongue.

298
01:01:53,500 --> 01:02:00,500
 and they told me that they had to cut it to do a thing called “khechari” to take back the tongue

299
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,760
 to raise the kundalini.

300
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:18,760
 So now when the kundalini rises it is like the ignition of a car,

301
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:34,720
 and when the car is ignited all the machinery works by itself, you don’t have to do anything.

302
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,680
 So what they do is to put back the tongue thinking by doing that the kundalini will rise,

303
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,820
 and poor things now can’t speak can’t eat very difficult,

304
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:17,380
 so it is like moving the wheels without starting the car, will it move?

305
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,160
 It’s all artificial,

306
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,620
 nobody gets realization in that

307
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,700
 because it’s a living process,

308
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,800
 now there’s integral yoga,

309
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,280
 that is all mental.

310
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,820
 Talking about yoga how can you get your realization?

311
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:05,080
 Supposing if you talk to the Mother Earth will she give us flowers?

312
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,720
 Talk..talk..talk..talk..talk..that’s all.

313
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,640
 People get fed up with that talks, books after books like this so many.

314
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,340
 So far I have not written any book for the same reason,

315
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,960
 then we have another one you call that one? It is transcendental meditation,

316
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:52,020
 that is the worst I tell you

317
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,460
 We had four people from transcendental,

318
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:20,040
 the man was the director of a flying foundation in Scotland,

319
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,460
 to get a mantra

320
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,400
 and the mantras were told in secret

321
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:48,700
 and the mantras were rare, funny ones “Inga, Pinga, Thinga”,

322
01:05:53,820 --> 01:06:00,500
 it has no meaning, it is not Sanskrit, it has no meaning but it has funny meaning also

323
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:11,580
 Inga means the scorpion’s bite

324
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:23,080
 and Pinga means when you get possessed you go round and round like that, that is Pinga

325
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,560
 and Thinga means when you show like this to someone,

326
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,460
 300 pounds for that,

327
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,960
 and 6000 pounds for flying halfway.

328
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:03,800
 What a stupidity, what is the need to fly halfway you already have traffic jams,

329
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:24,460
 then they were given to drink the water which boiled which boiled potatoes for six days

330
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,780
 then the rings of potato rings,

331
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,060
 and the last day was given the potatoes to eat.

332
01:07:51,520 --> 01:08:00,420
 But this director, his wife, his daughter and a deputy director all got epilepsy,

333
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,160
 so they came here.

334
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,540
 Luckily my husband has gone on a tour so they stayed in my house

335
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,400
 and with my treatment they got cured.

336
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:44,860
 They had lost all their money, this man was a diamond merchant, he had lost all his money his wife was a granddaughter of a Duke, she has lost everything.

337
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,160
 What is this lady…please tell her to sit down

338
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:06,040
 and a granddaughter who was the granddaughter of a Duke and this man became bankrupt.

339
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:27,120
 So and the director and the deputy director became bankrupts

340
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,520
 and he is now gone to South Africa and writing a book.

341
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,960
 The name of the book is “How we were befooled”.

342
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:56,800
 This t.m. and now they begin Ayurveda.

343
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,080
 They are marketing it now marketing it,

344
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,500
 there is no need for them to market anybody can take to Ayurveda,

345
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:36,680
 but for Ayurveda, you cannot do it here, you have to go to India because the herbs that are used for curing you cannot grow here.

346
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:57,380
 So, just that just trying to I don’t know what are they up to, I just don’t know, they can’t bring Ayurveda here.

347
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,820
 India, Indian medicine,

348
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:29,100
 I mean it is a common sense everybody knows in India that you can’t do Ayurveda anywhere else but in India.

349
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:42,800
 I think they will now give some sort of this to you in the name of Ayurveda and they will buy it.

350
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,940
 or they give may be some water which has boiled the potatoes.

351
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:09,960
 One should know all these things. There’s another one who gives diabetes, supposing.

352
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:24,260
 only to people who are very big cheats in India

353
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,060
 the horrible people who .. they are cheats.

354
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:50,300
 If he is so good why doesn’t he solves our problem financial problem in India?

355
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,140
 Why doesn’t he solves some  of our financial problem?

356
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,060
 All these people who doing it get heart trouble.

357
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,340
 I am telling you everything frankly,

358
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,600
 they will never talk against each other.

359
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:25,960
 Christ has said that the house of Satan will never speak against itself.

360
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:44,020
 But they will speak against Me they do!

361
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,060
 They make like that.

362
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,980
 They may speak against Me and tell you that I must be a dark force or something, they might,

363
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,240
 because it is their business, they will be using money when I am here.

364
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,135
 Alright, Thank you very much.
