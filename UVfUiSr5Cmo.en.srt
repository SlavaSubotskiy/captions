1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,630
who are from this
country, Greece.

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,950
When first I came
to Greece,

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,910
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,800
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

6
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,820
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

7
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,240
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

8
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,530
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,030
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,900
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,000
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,220
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,060
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,450
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

15
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,020
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,220
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,380
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,310
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

19
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,120
because he was busy
with his conference,

20
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,290
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,110
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,330
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,900
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,410
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,110
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,220
Now, you have to understand
that you people

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,820
have a very big responsibility
because you're

28
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,310
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,460
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

30
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,250
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,420
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,070
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,680
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

34
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,100
I mean the western
countries especially.

35
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,990
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

36
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,450
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

37
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,910
and which is very
dangerous.

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,370
To understand it,
you have to know

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,470
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

40
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,160
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,460
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,740
by your own behavior.

43
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,300
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

44
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,900
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

45
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,750
and they see that they
can influence very well,

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:53,580
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

47
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,800
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

48
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,380
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,950
down to earth and
so many, so many

50
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,100
good things you
have known in life,

51
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,610
it's very important to
understand the historical

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,500
background of your country,
first of all.

53
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,860
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

54
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,010
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

55
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,480
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,420
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

57
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,890
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

58
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,300
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,330
the historical background
of this country

60
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,820
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,900
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

62
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,900
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,900
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

64
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,700
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

65
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,650
Because there was
no connection

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,580
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,230
this, I mean, translation

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,220
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

69
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,550
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

70
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,450
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

71
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,420
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

72
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,380
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

73
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,260
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

74
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:02,230
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

75
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,860
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

76
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,290
And so, this Athena has
been described,

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,640
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

78
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,010
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

79
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,750
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

80
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,060
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

81
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,990
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,240
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

83
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,920
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

84
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,770
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

85
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,170
and everything
and he saw that.

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,960
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

87
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,290
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

88
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,350
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

89
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,540
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

90
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,340
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,640
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

92
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,560
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

93
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,730
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

94
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,100
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

95
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,790
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

96
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,270
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

97
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,490
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

98
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,780
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

99
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,620
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,930
showing that there are two
men and one woman

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,240
or two women and one
man and no relationship

102
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,800
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

103
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,440
And that was the tragedy.

104
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,670
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

105
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,370
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,870
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

107
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,350
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

108
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,130
What should we do?
Why should we?

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,360
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

110
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,370
We are very
unhappy people.

111
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,810
And all these things
started here to begin with.

112
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,250
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

113
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,780
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

114
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,070
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

115
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,740
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

116
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,470
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

117
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,590
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

118
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,020
That also made women
very left-sided.

119
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,040
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,300
with these tragedies
and all that.

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,280
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

122
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,680
sort of, disgusted
about that.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,130
So the left side
became very,

124
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,930
very prominent here
and that is how I think

125
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,530
many of these left-sided,

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,710
bhootish organizations
started here

127
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,240
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

128
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,110
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

129
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,980
which made you feel so guilty.

130
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,330
So you became
very left-sided.

131
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,710
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

132
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,460
by people who started
becoming overactive;

133
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,690
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

134
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,370
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

135
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,060
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

136
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,120
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

137
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,840
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

138
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,160
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,570
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

140
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,190
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

141
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,980
what is our historical
background.

142
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,690
The second, they should
be very well equipped

143
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,510
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

145
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,650
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

146
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,560
women also should
know everything about it.

147
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,450
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

148
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,140
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

149
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,620
because our chakras
are in danger.

150
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,550
All this knowledge
is free to you.

151
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,790
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

152
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,660
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,370
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

154
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,700
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

155
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,520
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

156
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,410
that we believe in and we
can show others also

157
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,320
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

158
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,810
We are not here to
spread some sort

159
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,680
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

160
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,950
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

161
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,550
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

162
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,610
and we have one
universal religion.

163
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,490
Now, people will ask
you then,

164
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,190
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

165
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,880
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

166
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,910
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

167
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,320
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

168
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,180
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

169
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,070
Gradually it will start
opening out.

170
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,270
It has happened with
all of you

171
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,270
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

172
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,310
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

173
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,210
you started opening
out, you matured

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

175
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,270
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

176
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,380
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

177
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,790
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

178
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,400
is to be condemned
all the time.

179
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,800
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

180
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,860
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

181
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,340
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

182
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,870
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

183
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,400
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

184
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,540
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

185
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,010
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

186
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,300
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

187
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,670
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

188
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,730
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

189
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,710
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,420
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

191
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,920
improve yourself,
to help others.

192
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
You can do everything
yourself.

193
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,450
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

194
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,760
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

195
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,880
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

196
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,210
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

197
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,620
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

198
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,690
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

199
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,210
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

200
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,670
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

201
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,620
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

202
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,690
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

203
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:22,530
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

204
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,400
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

205
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,660
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

206
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,980
But apart from that,
you should know

207
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,870
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

208
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,660
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

209
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,890
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

210
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,800
praying to that one.
What did we get?

211
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,670
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

212
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,310
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

213
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,310
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

214
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,250
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

215
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,480
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

216
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,000
quite capable person and
you can achieve

217
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,810
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

218
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,240
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

219
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,830
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

220
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,310
race anything.

221
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,020
You all can do very well

222
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,260
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

223
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,340
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

224
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,740
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

225
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,000
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

226
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,500
about any religion,
anything,

227
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,620
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

229
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,590
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

230
00:15:53,890 --> 00:16:02,570
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

231
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,090
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

232
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,020
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

233
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,660
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,290
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

235
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,930
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

236
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,060
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

237
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,990
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

238
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,420
and you'll be amazed

239
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,140
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

240
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,400
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

241
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,500
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

242
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,350
When I came out
I gave them.

243
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,470
I said, "Now, what to do?

244
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,880
I can't give you
realization just now."

245
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

246
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,500
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

247
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

248
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,210
all of them came and
came and sat down

249
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,460
and that open ground and
I gave them realization.

250
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,830
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

251
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,860
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

252
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,080
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

253
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,000
and realization is
being given.

254
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,020
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

255
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,710
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

256
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,230
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

257
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,760
No question of their
going back,

258
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,410
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

259
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,530
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

260
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,380
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

261
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,160
this democracy has
just harmed us.

262
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,600
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

263
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,870
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

264
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,680
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

265
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,500
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

266
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,080
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

267
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,820
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

268
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,740
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

269
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:24,810
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

270
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,580
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

271
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,010
and I started talking to
them about science.

272
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,520
I thought, better start
with science.

273
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,430
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

274
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,500
Tell us the science
of God."

275
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,630
Such open-minded people.

276
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,750
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

277
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,030
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

278
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,510
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

279
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,950
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

280
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,010
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

281
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,240
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

282
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,210
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

283
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,550
And that's very true about
every democratic country

284
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,430
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

285
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,600
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

286
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,310
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

287
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,330
but they are quite
money-oriented.

288
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,850
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

289
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,540
but the worst is
the corruption.

290
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

291
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

292
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,450
All these countries
are to be exposed.

293
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,620
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

294
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,770
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

295
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,340
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

296
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,480
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

297
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,680
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

298
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,190
that your spirit has
to work everything,

299
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,040
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

300
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,890
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

301
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,950
This is what one
has to know.

302
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,670
I was told it is very
difficult for you

303
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,500
to come for pujas
to Cabella

304
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,420
you all cannot join,
but one week,

305
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,360
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

306
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,820
You can come by boat
or something like that,

307
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,440
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

308
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,610
and then we can organize
your coming down.

309
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,350
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

310
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,050
and Guru Puja are
very important

311
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,950
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

312
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,530
I think it can be
arranged and organized

313
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,630
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

314
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,200
I know it's wherever I am,

315
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,870
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

316
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,460
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

317
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,080
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

318
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,790
nearer to other European
countries.

319
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,430
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

320
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,510
find it very difficult,
so this time

321
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,040
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

322
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,830
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

323
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,520
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

324
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,560
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

325
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,140
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

326
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,880
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

327
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,890
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

328
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,730
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

329
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,010
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

330
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,450
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

331
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,780
Please put your attention
towards Me,

332
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,700
don't turn your attention
very much.

333
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,600
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

334
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,060
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

335
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,000
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

336
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,850
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

337
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,550
or are you putting your
attention straight?

338
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,180
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

339
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,810
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

340
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,550
that you have here for
your collective.

341
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,650
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

342
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,070
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

343
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,590
a state where you
grow spiritually.

344
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,770
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

345
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,890
where you grow
spiritually.

346
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,890
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

347
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,860
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

348
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,220
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

349
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,480
Where are you putting
your attention?

350
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,820
If the attention could
be controlled

351
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,150
then things will
be all right.

352
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,300
He is crying,
the child is crying,

353
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,040
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

354
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,040
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

355
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,230
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

356
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,440
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

357
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,640
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

358
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,350
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

359
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,220
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

360
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,990
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

361
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,530
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

362
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,450
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

363
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,800
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

364
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,780
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

365
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,670
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

366
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,380
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

367
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,750
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

368
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,100
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

369
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,090
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

370
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,370
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

371
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,310
you can always
write to Me,

372
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,500
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

373
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,380
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

374
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,580
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

375
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,690
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

376
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,660
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

377
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,340
You must always
support the collective,

378
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,940
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

379
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,970
As you know, I was
telling him also

380
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,890
that he, if he has
problem with money,

381
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,870
we can give money
from Cabella

382
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,350
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

383
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,540
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

384
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,110
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

385
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,010
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

386
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,090
because we had such
a small group.

387
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,900
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

388
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

389
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,590
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

390
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,210
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

391
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,850
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

392
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,170
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

393
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,280
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

394
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,010
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

395
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,800
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

396
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,310
So best is to keep
to your own,

397
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,890
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

398
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,280
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

399
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,460
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

400
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

401
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,430
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

402
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,250
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

403
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,370
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

404
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,330
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

405
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,120
You can wash
yourself up, like,

406
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,390
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

407
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,610
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

408
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,210
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

409
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,080
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

410
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,710
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

411
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,160
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

412
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,960
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

413
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,490
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

414
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,590
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

415
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,810
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

416
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,630
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

417
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,130
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

418
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,330
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

419
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,510
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

420
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,880
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

421
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,620
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

422
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,370
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

423
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,430
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

424
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,200
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

425
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:32,250
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

426
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,920
your family, your society,
everybody,

427
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,820
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

428
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,460
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

429
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,680
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

430
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,620
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

431
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,930
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

432
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,780
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

433
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,090
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

434
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,550
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

435
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,960
and try to increase
this area,

436
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,160
this space of thoughtless
awareness

437
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,540
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

438
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,060
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

439
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,080
being realized by you,
curing by you,

440
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,860
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

441
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,380
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

442
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,660
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

443
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,480
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

444
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,940
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

445
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,670
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

446
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,920
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

447
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,450
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

448
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,010
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

449
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,720
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

450
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,020
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

451
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,710
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

452
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,100
and you can feel it,
the different centers

453
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,720
on your fingertips
about yourself.

454
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,390
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

455
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,760
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

456
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,940
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

457
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,440
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

458
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,720
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

459
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,650
So the language is
to change now.

460
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,970
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

461
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,530
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

462
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,050
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

463
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,950
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

464
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,760
We have to use them,
that's the point.

465
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,190
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

466
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,320
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

467
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

468
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,230
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

469
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,330
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

470
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,040
and it works out.

471
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,740
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

472
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,660
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

473
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,210
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

474
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,480
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

475
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,270
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

476
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,520
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

477
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,690
how you have achieved
all these things.

478
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,150
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

479
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,220
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

480
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,580
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

481
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,300
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

482
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,990
"Who were those people

483
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,160
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

484
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,230
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

485
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,980
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

486
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,580
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

487
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,150
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

488
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,500
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

489
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,980
So, I again tell
you that Greece

490
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,310
is a place where
you can do a lot.

491
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,610
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

492
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,030
and you have to
know what you are,

493
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,750
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

494
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,250
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

495
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,290
so they also develop that
personality by which

496
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,470
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

497
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,540
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

498
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,700
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

499
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,800
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

500
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,910
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

501
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,660
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

502
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,760
It's a new age
that has started.

503
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,370
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

504
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,100
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

505
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,040
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

506
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,480
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

507
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,190
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

508
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,640
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

509
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,790
and that you have
got your realization

510
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,060
and that you are
one of those

511
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,330
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

512
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,640
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

513
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,820
It's another point because
what I know about is that

514
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,730
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

515
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,960
many were lost
in between, you know,

516
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,010
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

517
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,950
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

518
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,180
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

519
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,540
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

520
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,050
that they have formed.

521
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,290
But your responsibility
is very great.

522
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,400
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

523
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,020
Never. Never think
like that.

524
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,060
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

525
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,900
May God bless you.

526
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,980
So today they want to
do the puja of Athena

527
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,210
And you will be surprised
that the names of Athena

528
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,990
are exactly about the same as
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

529
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,270
Is very surprising, they
have such beautiful names.

530
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,500
But we can have hundred
and eight names of… today

531
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,650
and you can read the
names and the meanings

532
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,900
and they can
say the mantras.

533
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,670
But first the children
have to wash My feet

534
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,280
with Ganesha stuti,
you can sing

535
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,460
Ganesha stuti.

536
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,500
You've got some musical
instrument or not?

537
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,830
Yes, yes.
You have.
