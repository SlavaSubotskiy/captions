1
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:53,095
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

2
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:58,643
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havan.

3
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:11,943
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

4
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:14,163
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

5
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:30,723
You know that He resides within us.

6
00:02:30,723 --> 00:03:00,933
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

7
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:06,333
excite His powers.

8
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:29,773
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

9
00:03:29,773 --> 00:04:05,943
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

10
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:22,682
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

11
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:35,053
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

12
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:40,763
attention to it with absolute purity.

13
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:57,883
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

14
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:07,733
Shri Ganesha.

15
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:12,643
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

16
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:25,173
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

17
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:39,423
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

18
00:05:39,423 --> 00:06:06,933
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

19
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:21,653
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

20
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:55,483
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

21
00:06:55,483 --> 00:07:07,703
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

22
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,752
So, in action you do like that.

23
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:22,972
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

24
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,203
been created.

25
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:33,893
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

26
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:38,263
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

27
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:54,393
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

28
00:07:54,393 --> 00:08:01,163
appreciation of creativity.

29
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:18,562
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

30
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:23,243
so that your ego is controlled.

31
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:35,453
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

32
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:39,782
Your Mother is a good example.

33
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:56,513
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

34
00:08:56,513 --> 00:09:01,953
that I am so knowledgeable.

35
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:17,963
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

36
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:23,853
that gives you a shock.

37
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:35,374
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

38
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:50,063
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

39
00:09:50,063 --> 00:10:02,203
But you must deal with it beautifully.

40
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:09,373
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

41
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:16,073
That is the central point, that is the result.

42
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:26,753
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

43
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:35,713
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

44
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:59,982
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

45
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:03,352
effect.

46
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:16,982
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

47
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:25,553
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

48
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:35,493
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

49
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,313
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

50
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:52,283
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

51
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:55,612
to call him Napoleon.

52
00:11:55,612 --> 00:12:06,443
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

53
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:08,153
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

54
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:21,313
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

55
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,612
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

56
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:28,643
There is no love in fanaticism.

57
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:39,943
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

58
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:46,915
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

59
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:52,423
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

60
00:12:52,423 --> 00:13:10,133
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

61
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:23,523
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

62
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:31,023
and not a tense, abrupt person.

63
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:46,703
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

64
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:51,183
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

65
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:56,732
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

66
00:13:56,732 --> 00:14:05,593
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

67
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:10,852
Innocence is the wisest thing.

68
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:16,922
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

69
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:24,014
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

70
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:35,523
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

71
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:50,253
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

72
00:14:50,253 --> 00:15:08,133
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

73
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:17,143
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

74
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:23,003
It gives you concentration.

75
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:33,883
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

76
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:38,852
Sucking everything!

77
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:58,253
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

78
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:11,133
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

79
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:21,603
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

80
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:28,792
to what he is to do next.

81
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:34,412
So innocence keeps you in the present.

82
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,243
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

83
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:40,403
Supposing I have to go today.

84
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:51,912
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

85
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:56,353
about it?

86
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:59,183
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

87
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:10,813
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

88
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:18,203
Because they are not in the present.

89
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:22,703
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

90
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:28,303
At the most what’s going to happen?

91
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:37,742
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

92
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:38,982
So why worry?

93
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:47,762
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

94
00:17:47,762 --> 00:18:06,523
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

95
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:18,382
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

96
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:26,333
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

97
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:41,142
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

98
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:54,303
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

99
00:18:54,303 --> 00:19:04,023
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

100
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:10,692
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

101
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:25,092
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

102
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:31,872
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

103
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:38,512
What can I fear anymore?

104
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:50,213
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

105
00:19:50,213 --> 00:20:06,632
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

106
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:13,232
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

107
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:21,752
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

108
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:29,873
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

109
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:38,992
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

110
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:54,942
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

111
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:55,942
… “.

112
00:20:55,942 --> 00:21:07,653
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

113
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:08,653
this … “.

114
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:21,582
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

115
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:37,072
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

116
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:46,612
It sees the play.

117
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:49,462
Just sees.

118
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:56,332
It enjoys the play.

119
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,553
Just enjoys.

120
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:14,612
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

121
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:19,112
power of innocence be enlightened”.

122
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:34,112
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

123
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:39,062
The source of emotional security.

124
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:50,757
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

125
00:22:50,782 --> 00:23:12,046
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

126
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,335
A motherly enchantment.

127
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:23,663
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

128
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:41,852
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

129
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:52,793
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

130
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,722
But some people confuse it.

131
00:23:54,722 --> 00:24:07,572
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

132
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:12,423
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

133
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:16,092
“Motha Bal”.

134
00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:27,112
And there’s no end to it.

135
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:43,733
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

136
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,872
no time.

137
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:54,702
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

138
00:24:54,702 --> 00:25:05,846
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

139
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:09,012
He is the eldest of all.

140
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:19,832
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

141
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:33,012
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

142
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:44,462
doesn’t like it much.

143
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:53,312
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

144
00:25:53,312 --> 00:26:04,582
But it does not go to his head or anything.

145
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:10,833
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

146
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:21,572
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

147
00:26:21,572 --> 00:26:33,072
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

148
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:39,702
Feet, because I have known that art”.

149
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:47,283
I said alright, come such and such day.

150
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:56,293
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

151
00:26:56,293 --> 00:27:00,303
It is me who is relaxing”.

152
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:10,012
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

153
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:27,033
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

154
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,033
It relaxes.

155
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:33,742
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

156
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:45,122
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

157
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:56,043
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

158
00:27:56,043 --> 00:28:03,762
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

159
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:07,922
who does that.

160
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:14,043
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

161
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:20,372
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

162
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:32,922
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

163
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:59,972
person needs it.

164
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:10,913
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

165
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:16,403
It is ‘you’ who need it.

166
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:21,582
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

167
00:29:21,582 --> 00:29:34,913
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

168
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:42,832
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

169
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:44,942
it that way.

170
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:51,092
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

171
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:59,262
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

172
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:09,892
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

173
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:19,632
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

174
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:28,303
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

175
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:40,072
where Ganesha is pleased.

176
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:45,842
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

177
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:51,422
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

178
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:59,862
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

179
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:16,112
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

180
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:19,612
all His powers.

181
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:29,812
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

182
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:39,192
Both the types of powers must be developed.

183
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:46,222
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

184
00:31:46,222 --> 00:32:05,913
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

185
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:10,993
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

186
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:18,122
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

187
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:39,413
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

188
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:58,462
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

189
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:18,002
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

190
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:44,222
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

191
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:53,283
It is very natural.

192
00:33:53,283 --> 00:34:10,732
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

193
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:17,572
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

194
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,132
than to their wives.

195
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:20,523
Funny thing.

196
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:24,342
It is absurd.

197
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:30,333
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

198
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,113
it is not good.

199
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:35,502
It’s again perversion.

200
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:47,643
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

201
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:52,433
It is absurd.

202
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:57,223
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

203
00:34:57,223 --> 00:35:04,293
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

204
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:19,733
There has to be very healthy relationship.

205
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:30,743
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

206
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:32,652
So nothing absurd should be done.

207
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:35,922
No thing overly should be done.

208
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:48,043
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

209
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:56,973
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

210
00:35:56,973 --> 00:36:01,643
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

211
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:17,753
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

212
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:18,753
of Mr.

213
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:29,882
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

214
00:36:29,882 --> 00:36:35,733
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

215
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:38,983
Or we may be jealous.

216
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:43,912
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

217
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:48,983
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

218
00:36:48,983 --> 00:37:01,372
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

219
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:02,833
like him.

220
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:08,912
I am talking of wisdom.

221
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:20,652
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

222
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:35,173
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

223
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:38,373
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

224
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:43,192
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

225
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:54,412
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

226
00:37:54,412 --> 00:38:10,773
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

227
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:23,483
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

228
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:30,183
So it is quite funny.

229
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:43,583
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

230
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:52,363
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

231
00:38:52,363 --> 00:39:03,352
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

232
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:11,023
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

233
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:17,452
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

234
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:23,843
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

235
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:29,253
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

236
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:35,853
I was just trying to put it right.

237
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:44,073
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

238
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:47,632
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

239
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:48,632
Meat out.

240
00:39:48,632 --> 00:40:02,573
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

241
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:13,133
So there should be maryadas.

242
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:27,192
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

243
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:39,253
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

244
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:50,692
this person or that person -I know it is.

245
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,973
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

246
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:53,973
that is good.

247
00:40:53,973 --> 00:41:01,283
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

248
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:15,333
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

249
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:21,442
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

250
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:32,662
So, now I can be very bad.

251
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:36,692
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

252
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:37,692
it was all right.

253
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:45,063
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

254
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:49,083
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

255
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,842
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

256
00:41:51,842 --> 00:42:00,122
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

257
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:03,723
Just like that.

258
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:10,083
To use it as a power.

259
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,622
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

260
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:21,003
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

261
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:33,043
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

262
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,202
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

263
00:42:34,202 --> 00:42:39,413
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

264
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:41,493
Now, what is the wisdom?

265
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:45,523
Where is it lost?

266
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:48,543
It is ridiculous.

267
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:54,593
So, one has to be wise.

268
00:42:54,593 --> 00:43:01,243
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

269
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:12,393
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

270
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:18,813
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

271
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:23,713
in one lecture.

272
00:43:23,713 --> 00:43:33,513
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

273
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:37,323
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

274
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,763
is all; he is not bothered.

275
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:51,902
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

276
00:43:51,902 --> 00:44:04,813
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

277
00:44:04,813 --> 00:44:11,773
with your innocence.

278
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:21,273
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

279
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:29,803
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

280
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,202
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

281
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:43,233
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

282
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:55,303
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

283
00:44:55,303 --> 00:45:12,723
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

284
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:15,323
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

285
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:24,513
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

286
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:32,753
Not to see anything that is tempting.

287
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:38,452
So put your eyes on the ground.

288
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:52,362
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

289
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:58,192
with lust.

290
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:12,622
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

291
00:46:12,622 --> 00:46:20,142
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

292
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:31,463
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

293
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:40,412
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

294
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:55,763
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.
