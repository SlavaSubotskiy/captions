1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:16,139
...that Sahaja Yoga is first to start your
germination, then it grows.

2
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:27,050
In that growth, you have to become a wider
personality and a wider personality.

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,950
With the marriage you become even a better
person, and you develop a better personality.

4
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:41,260
Now, why marriage is necessary for Sahaja
Yogis?

5
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,290
First and foremost thing, it is the most normal
thing to do, is to marry.

6
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,620
God has given you this desire to be married
for some purpose.

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:01:05,180
But, the same desire, if you do not use it
for the purpose it is given, it can become

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,780
a perversion, it can become a nasty thing.

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,210
It can be very detrimental to your growth.

10
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:25,200
So one should understand this desire within
us to have a marriage.

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,190
Marriage means a wife, who is a part and parcel
of your being.

12
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,490
A wife on whom you can depend.

13
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,490
She’s your mother, she’s your sister,
she’s your child, she’s everything.

14
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,970
You can share all your feelings with your
wife.

15
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,130
So it is important that the wife should be
such, that she should understand that this

16
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,740
is the need of a marriage.

17
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,250
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, as you have seen, all
of you have problems either of the left or

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,250
the right.

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:17,310
Now, when these marriages will take place,
mostly spontaneously, it will happen by the

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:27,599
nature’s plan itself, that you will marry
a person who is a complementary personality

21
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,599
to you.

22
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,030
Because, supposing you are a Left-sided person,
and if you have a person who has a Left Side

23
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,209
that is very strong, it will compensate, and
that’s how you make a good marriage.

24
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,099
But, for that, one thing is very important:
that you must share.

25
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,519
You must share life, every bit of it, every
moment of it.

26
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,880
If you do not know how to share life, it’s
going to be very, very difficult.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,310
When it comes to love, how do we express our
love?

28
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,840
By sharing all of our joys and all of our
pains, all of our problems.

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,880
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s a little more,
I think quite a lot more, much more.

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,330
Here you have to share the community.

31
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,249
The marriage is not for individuals, in Sahaja
Yoga, not at all.

32
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:26,840
If anybody has this feeling that the marriage
is between two persons in Sahaja Yoga, it’s

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
a wrong thing.

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,569
It is two communities, it can be two nations,
it can be completely two universes.

35
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,709
So, it is not to be enjoyed between yourself.

36
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,550
If you are a good husband-wife to each other
it’s not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga.

37
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,609
That love should be enjoyed by everyone else,
in the society, in the community.

38
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,999
If you cannot do that, then you have not achieved
Sahaja Yoga marriage.

39
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:57,300
It’s just an ordinary marriage as people
have; it’s just nothing special about it.

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:07,749
Such marriage should be able to give chances
for very great souls to come on this earth.

41
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:16,730
A person who is married in Sahaja Yoga, who
are Sahaja Yogis, who are sharing their love

42
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:29,390
equally with the Sahaja Yogis and the society
that is Sahaja Yoga, then only great people

43
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,390
will be born.

44
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,540
I would say Bogdan has done that.

45
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,610
Bogdan and Mandy, they have done it.

46
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,190
It’s something surprising.

47
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,380
You see, they were engaged before marriage,
they were married before Sahaja Yoga, they

48
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,730
were married after Realisation and I don’t
know how, it is clicked in their life, that

49
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,740
they really share companionship with other
Sahaja Yogis.

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,980
Whenever he writes to me, he always writes
about other Sahaja Yogis, he’ll ask about

51
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,300
every one of them, how are they, what are
their problems.

52
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Unless and until it happens, the marriage
has no meaning in Sahaja Yoga, at all, no

53
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
meaning.

54
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,950
So, first test of a Sahaja Yogi marriage is
that, how much you have been able to share

55
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,820
by this marriage, other people.

56
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:25,220
Now, for example, in a normal marriage, a
man is the person who is the head of the family,

57
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,100
as you say.

58
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,190
Now, he has to be the head, the man has to
be head for certain reasons.

59
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,580
There is nothing wrong in man becoming the
head, it’s all right: you become the heart.

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,970
Heart is more important than head is.

61
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,160
Perhaps, we do not realise that how heart
is important.

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,760
You see, even if the head fails, the heart
can go on.

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,220
We can go on always up till the heart is going
on.

64
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,640
But, if the heart fails, the head fails too.

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,780
So you are the heart as a woman, and he is
the head of the family.

66
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,800
Let him have that feeling that he is the head;
it’s a feeling, just a feeling.

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,150
Like the head always feels that he decides.

68
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,120
But, it’s the brain that also knows that
it’s the heart one has to cater for.

69
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,430
It’s the heart which is all-pervading, which
is the real source of everything.

70
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,650
So the woman’s position, if she understands
how important it is, she would never feel

71
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,901
let down or dominated if she knows she’s
the heart.

72
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:37,550
I think this is the point people, women, especially
in the West, have lost and have forgotten

73
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,100
and have not realised.

74
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,600
If they had realised this point, there would
have been much less problem.

75
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,890
It is not the way people think they control
others and dominate others or sort of try

76
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,190
to suppress them: it is not that way.

77
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,170
It is the heart which really governs everything.

78
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,690
Heart rules out everything else.

79
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:12,450
It is heart which has got the power to envelope
the brain, to sooth it.

80
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,690
Brain is a headache, you know, it works, works
like mad.

81
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:25,640
But, heart is the one which can really cover
the whole body with its love and can soothe

82
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,820
it and can give it joy and happiness.

83
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,650
It is the heart which contains the Spirit.

84
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,730
So, heart is a very important thing, which
is the power of he body.

85
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,680
Like ultimately you have to become the Spirit,
which is in the heart.

86
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,510
With brain you know things and that’s why
the man has to be the head.

87
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,950
He has to go out, he has to work, he has to
deal with people.

88
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,140
His life is, he’s an extrovert, as you call
it.

89
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,390
And woman also has to work sometimes if there
is difficulties and troubles.

90
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:02,120
But a woman should not feel dominated, if
the man says, “All right you don’t work."

91
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,140
But if he says it in love.

92
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:10,530
Now, if the brain starts dominating the heart
too much, what will happen?

93
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,800
Then there will be dryness.

94
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,830
Like, many men are very meticulous, very particular.

95
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,510
They are headaches; absolute headaches to
themselves, to others and to the whole society.

96
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,640
Such people can become extremely dry and they
can be all the time.

97
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,990
They can never enjoy their wives, they can
never enjoy their children, they cannot enjoy

98
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,909
anything whatsoever, because they are so particular.

99
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,190
Like they said, “Come at 5:10”.

100
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,310
Now, if you reach there at 5:09 or 5:11, you
had it!

101
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,800
They are just watching time, just to find
out the faults: as soon as the wife comes,

102
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,390
they’ll be shouting, “What?

103
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,970
You’ve come so late!”

104
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,970
How many?

105
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,970
45 seconds!

106
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,970
Lost!

107
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,569
You see, the is wife coming, the expectancy,
the meeting of it, the joy of it.

108
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,269
You are going to meet your own heart!

109
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,990
[This] is lacking.

110
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,829
Now this brain can go all off the rule, it
can go.

111
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,890
And it can be very, very taxing.

112
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,230
It creates tremendous problems within.

113
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:22,360
So, heart must be respected, heart must be
obeyed, that’s the point.

114
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Heart must be obeyed.

115
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,000
But, that doesn’t mean that the women should
dominate men.

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,139
It doesn’t mean that.

117
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,620
Obeyed means you must understand what your
love says.

118
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,509
Do it in love.

119
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,139
If you do it in love, it’s very good.

120
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,300
For example I am lecturing you morning till
evening.

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,060
You are not tired of my lectures.

122
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,070
Normally people should be, “What’s this
sermon going on?

123
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,430
This lady all the time talking to us?”

124
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,970
But, you do not mind it for one reason.

125
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Why?

126
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,769
Because you know I love you very much.

127
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:55,709
In the same way the woman must establish the
role that she loves.

128
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,889
The man may become a little funny, but he’ll
come around.

129
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,449
He’ll go a little astray but, he’ll come
around.

130
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,629
But, do not judge him in outward dominations.

131
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,920
Like, you see, if he says, “This colour
is not good”, “All right, whatever you

132
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
like I’ll put it”.

133
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,019
Then he himself will say, “Oh, I think the
one you had put was good.

134
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:19,559
You know I was really foolish!” (laughter)
He would say like that!

135
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,949
You just agree to them!

136
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,040
I mean I have experimented this in my own
life.

137
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,160
I have done it.

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,930
For example, my husband doesn’t know much
of roads, so, supposing we are going somewhere,

139
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,920
and he said, “I think this is the way you
have to go."

140
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
I said, “All right you can go ahead and
I will walk with you."

141
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,230
But I said, “No, but I think it’s not
the road, I’ll have to walk again back I

142
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,230
know for definite.

143
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,980
But, all right, if you want, I can walk with
you.

144
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
All right I’m walking.

145
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I am just enjoying.

146
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,100
I may have to go this way only."

147
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,699
Then he starts wondering, “Is it true?

148
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:52,720
Is it correct?”

149
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,240
(laughter) Then he starts thinking that, “Is
it really?”or “Maybe?”

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,980
Because she has instincts.

151
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,100
She has intuition.

152
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,899
She has so many things.

153
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:20,990
She gets that hunch.

154
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,189
They get a hunch.

155
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,320
They get a hunch of it.

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,819
And that’s what it is.

157
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:30,059
And once they start understanding, that the
hunches of the wife is correct, then they

158
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,779
follow her, in a way.

159
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,889
But, what is so great in making your husband
follow you?

160
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:35,889
It’s wrong.

161
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,860
I think there is no need for him to follow.

162
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,629
“You go this way!”

163
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,939
What is the need to do all that?

164
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:45,240
We are going the same way.

165
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,581
But we must know that somebody is on the left,
one is on the right.

166
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:51,079
The left has to be on the left.

167
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,279
Supposing the left wheel starts going to the
right — we’ll have only one wheel left.

168
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,509
What are we going to do about it?

169
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,630
We are all going on the same way!

170
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,059
There are no two ways about it.

171
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,389
There are two wheels needed to give it a balance.

172
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,570
But we are going on the same way.

173
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,470
This, people don’t realise: they think one
wheel has to go on the right and another has

174
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,520
to turn to the left.

175
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,890
So, imagine what will be the condition of
such a family.

176
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,260
We are going on the same way.

177
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,189
Only understanding is needed.

178
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:25,660
That one has to live with the powers of heart,
and another has to live with the powers of

179
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,009
rationality, of understanding.

180
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:32,879
Now, when it comes to rationality, ultimately
it will turn to heart.

181
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,160
Because it reaches a point where it does not
know.

182
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,189
Then it comes to heart.

183
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,029
Once women realise this, that they have this
within themselves.

184
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,970
But, you must nurture your power of heart.

185
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,160
But you compete with them in everything: “If
he goes on the horse why can’t I?”

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,949
“He does this, why can’t I?”

187
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,079
“If he can drive, I can drive."

188
00:12:52,079 --> 00:13:03,190
Wisdom lies in doing things, many things by
avoiding them.

189
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,820
For example, I don’t drive, so everybody
drives me along.

190
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,339
I don’t type, very good: everybody types
for me.

191
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,519
But, I do some things which nobody can do
as well as I can do.

192
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,100
Like I can cook very well.

193
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,029
So when it comes to cooking, they have to
come to me!

194
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,029
It’s like that.

195
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,459
But, you don’t do everything that the men
want to do.

196
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,610
Or you don’t do everything women want to
do.

197
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,709
For men, will be cooking and women will be
driving, is a wrong thing.

198
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,290
Men should know all manly things and women
should know womanly things.

199
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,290
They must learn.

200
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,860
They must put their heart into it.

201
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,690
I mean women can be equally intelligent, men
can be equally intelligent.

202
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,009
Women can go on to the right hand, and men
can go on the left hand.

203
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,019
No doubt about it.

204
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,970
But, you put imbalance to the whole universe
by that, that’s the point.

205
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,550
It’s not that by doing that you are in any
way less or more.

206
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,389
This idea should go out of your minds absolutely.

207
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,509
That men think that, “Oh, I’m the man
who wears the pants!”

208
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,209
All right, you wear the pants but, we wear
the beautiful skirts!

209
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,160
That’s the way it should be looked after.

210
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,300
Once this goes away, Sahaja Yoga will work
out better.

211
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,230
The domination only is felt when there is
no love.

212
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,879
Sometimes you like people to dominate you,
isn’t it.

213
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,839
For example, let’s say, “Come along, have
this food.

214
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,579
You must eat, you must have this."

215
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,679
You like it, because somebody cares for you:
there’s a concern, somebody loves you, wants

216
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,110
you to have this and wants you to do that.

217
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,660
You like such a person.

218
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,259
You want somebody to do that.

219
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:39,839
You do not want to be left to dogs that: “Do
whatever you please!”

220
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,749
That kind of thing is no good.

221
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,009
And once you develop that feeling that, “Oh,
that the person cares for me.

222
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,119
That person loves."

223
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,839
Then you also start caring for the feelings
of that person.

224
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,019
You also start to understand.

225
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,269
Now again the guilt is working.

226
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,040
Now will you please stop feeling guilty about
anything.

227
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,949
I do not say these things to make you feel
guilty, but just to understand that you have

228
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,829
to be in a very light mood, in a very light
mood.

229
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:14,189
This balance has been created long time back,
a very long time back.

230
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:20,000
Even when Radha Krishna existed: Radha was
the power and Krishna was the one who was

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,929
expressing.

232
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,740
As you say, the potential and the kinetic.

233
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,160
And people only know about Krishna, but Radha
was the power.

234
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,949
When He had to kill Kamsa, He had to ask Radha,
to do it.

235
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,429
It was She who did everything, She had to
dance and He pressed Her feet.

236
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,110
He said, “Now You must be tired."

237
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,559
I mean, why did She dance?

238
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,769
Because without Her dancing, things could
not work out.

239
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,610
So, it is so interdependent.

240
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,680
It is so interdependent.

241
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,489
As you cannot have a wick, and you cannot
have the light.

242
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,829
You cannot have these two things separate.

243
00:15:53,829 --> 00:16:00,850
If you can understand that, then this balance
is completely harmonious.

244
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,110
It is between God and His power: absolutely
one.

245
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:12,519
You can’t imagine, how it is one with God
and His power.

246
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,899
His power, His desire, is the same as God.

247
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,689
There’s no difference at all.

248
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:20,579
But, in human beings you are disintegrated
people.

249
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,399
Your desire is different, your thinking is
different, your asking is different.

250
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,010
Everything is so disintegrated, that’s why
you cannot understand.

251
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,420
That’s why marriages are also disintegrated.

252
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,029
[It’s] the complete integration.

253
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,029
Is the intermingling.

254
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,339
If the wife has to work, one need not worry.

255
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,009
If the man has to work, doesn’t worry: as
long as there is complete understanding of

256
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,189
integration, of balance, within you.

257
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:49,269
Of course, the women are responsible [for
the] grace of the family.

258
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,279
She has to be gracious.

259
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,899
It doesn’t look nice for a woman to behave
like a man because, man need not be that gracious

260
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,259
as the woman is.

261
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,589
He is after all a man.

262
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:00,730
So, its all right.

263
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:07,709
I mean, in his behaviour, he need not be atrocious
but sometimes if he swears sometimes, doesn’t

264
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,390
matter, sometimes, in a way: for a man.

265
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,520
But, for a woman, it does because she is a
gracious thing.

266
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,269
But, there are some things that a man cannot
do: like, taking interest in women.

267
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,610
Some men are so hot you know, horrible and
absolutely, one can’t understand the way

268
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,850
they take interest in women.

269
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,510
What dresses women wear sort of thing.

270
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,650
All this rat-like behaviour, it’s horrible.

271
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,260
And this cannot be manly.

272
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,810
That means that they are such slaves of women.

273
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,250
They may call themselves something this and
that.

274
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,500
I heard this Mrs.

275
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,110
Kennedy’s clothes, under clothes, were for
sale.

276
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,050
And people from Australia were flying out
to buy them!

277
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,950
And I mean think of these men.!What do you
call them?

278
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,190
I don’t know what do you call them in English
language.

279
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,039
But, they are just worst than earthworms.

280
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,860
I don’t know from where they come.

281
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,909
So a man has to be a man!

282
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,289
And man is a person like Rama is.

283
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,799
You have heard about his life, how He was.

284
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,330
How He loved His wife, respected His own chastity.

285
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,220
A man who cannot respect his own chastity
is not a man.

286
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,690
He is absolutely an earthworm.

287
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,070
So, this is what it is.

288
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,220
A man has to have a character, he has to have
that chivalry in him, he has to have that

289
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,980
courage in him, he has to have that protective
thing.

290
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,490
If thieves come in the house [and] the man
tell the wife, “Oh you go and open the door,

291
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,399
and I am going to hide!” (laughter) And
when the thieves go away, he says, “I’m

292
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,420
going dominate!” that’s not the way.

293
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,980
The man has to protect.

294
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
The man has to look after.

295
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,530
That’s why it doesn’t matter if he is
a little crude sometimes.

296
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,530
It doesn’t matter.

297
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,530
Because he has to face.

298
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,120
He’s like a thorn and women are like the
flowers.

299
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,610
Now, in the thorn and flower, you would like
to be a flower, isn’t it, but, in a man

300
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,360
and woman, you would like to be a thorn!

301
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,779
So it’s wrong.

302
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:04,929
He has to protect, he has to look after the
invasions on the family-life and other things.

303
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:11,610
On the contrary, they are the ones who allow
infiltration by wrong people in the family.

304
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,840
It’s the men.

305
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,309
They bring in horrible women, they bring in
horrible people, through their domination,

306
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,429
“Oh, she’s my friend!

307
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,520
How can you object?”

308
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,860
But, what sort of friend is she?

309
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,000
He has to say, “No,I don’t like these
people to come in the house, they are not

310
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the right-type.

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
They have to get out."

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,960
It is he who has to say.

313
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,120
And the woman has to understand.

314
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,019
But if he says it just out of domination,
it is nonsense.

315
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,760
So, everything has two sides, as you can see
clearly.

316
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
If it is done in love, it’s perfect.

317
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,399
But, if it is done in domination, it’s nonsensical.

318
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,399
Why dominate?

319
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,890
I mean, I don’t understand the word ‘domination’.

320
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,350
When there are two wheels do they dominate
each other?

321
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,350
Can they?

322
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,470
If one dominates, say one becomes bigger than
the other, it will go round and round, won’t

323
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,470
it.

324
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,220
There’s no question in domination in this.

325
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,100
But, it’s a question of integration and
understanding and complete cooperation within

326
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,730
themselves, which must permeate into the society,
into the family.

327
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,539
The marriages which are not helpful to the
society are of no use, they are just a waste,

328
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,570
just a waste.

329
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,230
We have so many marriages like this.

330
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,740
People get married, live well, happily among
themselves and finish off.

331
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,400
These are the marriages which are going to
change the society, with their joy, happiness,

332
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,140
make home where everybody is expected, look
after them, do for others.

333
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,190
There are many people who think that nobody
is doing anything for us: what have you done

334
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,190
for others?

335
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,190
What have you done?

336
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,200
Have you done anything for them?

337
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:52,350
This, once you start deciding and understanding,
it would be very good.

338
00:20:52,350 --> 00:21:00,450
Normally a woman is, if not brought up properly,
can be very, very conceited and can be very

339
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,500
selfish and self-centred.

340
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,059
Men can be also, but, women can be.

341
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:11,169
Because if they are not brought up properly
— I am saying that — they may not like

342
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,120
to spend their money on others.

343
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,080
They would not like others to come in the
house and share this and that.

344
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,500
But, again we have to judge it: is it done
in love or not?

345
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,860
Like the husband brings his friends, and they
may not like their friends coming in because

346
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,260
it means money.

347
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,500
They would like to have more ornaments to
themselves, than to have some friends.

348
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,720
It can be, they can be like that.

349
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,450
Some men are like that also.

350
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,019
But, both the things are wrong.

351
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:40,630
This should be shared to be understood.

352
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,860
And the whole things is that you must lavish
your love on others.

353
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,820
You need not spend money for that.

354
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Need not.

355
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,980
You can just be kind to them, nice to them
and a little money too.

356
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,549
There is not harm in spending a little money
for others and expressing your love.

357
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:04,020
We are still very meticulous in our Sahaja
Yoga as far as money is concerned, as far

358
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,150
as love is concerned.

359
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,559
We are very, very cautious.

360
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,230
We have so much of fear within us.

361
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,720
Now domination should never come in Sahaja
Yoga at all.

362
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,080
For example, when I am telling you anything,
an outsider you might think I am dominating

363
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,440
you, because really I am touching very sore
points within you, if you see it clearly,

364
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
it is there.

365
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,570
Putting the Left Side too much: You are all
feeling guilty, that’s not good, come along!

366
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:40,889
So, this is also an escape, that you start
feeling guilty and you then just don’t cure

367
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:41,889
yourself.

368
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,529
Just don’t feel guilty about anything.

369
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,010
I am just telling you this because I have
to tell you!

370
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:53,659
Now, one can feel that this is domination,
if they do not see the love behind it, the

371
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,630
beauty behind it, the compassion behind it.

372
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,950
So, never to feel that anybody dominates you
is the best way.

373
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,130
How can you be dominated?

374
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,370
You are the Spirit!

375
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,860
Your ego can be hurt.

376
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,080
You are the Spirit: it cannot be dominated.

377
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,110
But, are you the Spirit?

378
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,649
Are you feeling your Spirit?

379
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,340
If you are feeling your Spirit you can never
be dominated, no one can dominate you.

380
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,451
But, if you feel that way, all the time, that
you are dominated you will become a very,

381
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,740
very nervous person.

382
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,620
You can be a horrible person.

383
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,360
You cannot face people.

384
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,450
So it is time you realise you are a Spirit
and your husband is also a Spirit.

385
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,639
Or if you are the husband, you must know the
wife is also a Spirit.

386
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:48,429
And a mutual respect must grow in that level,
because both of you are saints, you are Sahaja

387
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,429
Yogis.

388
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,659
You must respect each other because you are
Sahaja Yogis.

389
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:58,929
Everybody respects you because you are Sahaja
Yogis — [those] who have not achieved Realisation:

390
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:00,720
“oh, they are realised-souls."

391
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,820
You just think when you were not realised
if someone had told you that, “He is a realised-soul."

392
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,269
How you would have felt about that person.

393
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,330
You are not conscious of that but you should
be conscious.

394
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,360
By that you should not become vain but you
must respect others, they are realised-souls,

395
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,710
they are the children of your Mother.

396
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,510
When talking to each other you have to understand
that: more so when you are husband and wife.

397
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,830
The whole understanding that you had so far
of husband-wife must be given up.

398
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,960
It is, I think a contract sort of a marriage.

399
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,740
In a marriage you see, “How much he dominates?

400
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
What are his powers?

401
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
What are my powers?

402
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,440
How much money I get?

403
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,360
How much he gets, where’s the money kept?

404
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,820
What’s all that?”

405
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,669
It will only happen when you do not trust
each other.

406
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:54,560
But, go on trusting more and more.

407
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,700
There should be a competition in loving.

408
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:04,960
There should be a competition in trusting,
in being honest, in being kind, in being in

409
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
service.

410
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,870
Let there be a competition like that, and
then you will achieve results.

411
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,170
The competition should be on the other side,
instead of dominating, instead of being afraid,

412
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,250
instead of sharing all nonsense.

413
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,610
There’s another thing which I must point
out which happens to married couples and which

414
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,280
is very, very wrong also: that both of them,
take up a role of very miserable people, the

415
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Les Miserables!

416
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,100
They sit down, crying, weeping “Oh, ho,
ho!” for nothing at all.

417
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,909
[As if] the whole world is collapsing before
them.

418
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:40,020
Now there are some ‘great’ poets, like
Lord Byron maybe or some horrible people,

419
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,260
who have written horrible poems like that.

420
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,240
And they will recite those poems, “The sweetest
songs are those [that tell of saddest thought]”

421
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,602
and all sorts of nonsense: not for Sahaja
Yogis.

422
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:53,190
You are not to indulge in this kind of nonsense
and sitting down and indulging into this kind

423
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,270
of nonsense and enjoying the miseries of each
other.

424
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,850
For the present, you have no miseries.

425
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,980
Whatever has been there is past and finished.

426
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,279
Now, you are new people, with new awareness
with new things.

427
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,280
You have no miseries.

428
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,019
So, forget all those things and try to enjoy
each other’s company.

429
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,991
If you start doing that, sitting down and
enjoying the miseries: you [must] get out

430
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:19,169
of it immediately and say, “Oh, We are getting
into the same play of Lord Byron!”

431
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,200
I don’t want to create Lord Byrons out of
Sahaja Yogis any more.

432
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,559
So please remember that: don’t sit down
and discus and analyse your miseries.

433
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,710
You have no miseries of any kind.

434
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,519
You are the Spirit.

435
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,490
You are the source of joy for yourself and
for others and you have no business to sit

436
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,360
down and cry and weep and I don’t know what
is happening?

437
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,220
I don’t know why you don’t know your Spirit.

438
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,269
Don’t you know your Spirit?

439
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:47,269
You know!

440
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:48,269
Then why don’t you know?

441
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:51,850
You have your vibratory awareness and still
how is it you are saying you don’t know?

442
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,200
You have to know everything.

443
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:01,650
And it has to be a very positive act to be
happy to be fragrant with joy and to give

444
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,799
joy to others.

445
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,539
That has to be with you.

446
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,029
Otherwise, everything has no meaning.

447
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,710
You see, I try my level best to make every
marriage a very pompous thing a very beautiful

448
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:19,450
thing but, ultimately, what I find is two
crumpled up people sitting down there sulking!

449
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,649
(laughing) And then imagine the children who
are going to be born.

450
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:32,279
They will think, “What these sulking parents,
oh God, save us from these crying babies!”

451
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:39,340
So don’t put my all hopes to my complete
shattering state, by this kind of attitude.

452
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:46,750
Now, if you have any questions, ask them because
I don’t know how far to say.

453
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,750
Close it.

454
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,609
(The microphone)
