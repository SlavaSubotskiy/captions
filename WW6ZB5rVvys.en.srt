1
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:08,680
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

2
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:14,721
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

3
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:18,521
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:25,251
We all have heard about His birth

5
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:31,084
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

6
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:37,709
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

7
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:43,584
And then it was predicted

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,875
that a child will be born in your family

9
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:53,501
who will be either a great saint

10
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:57,875
or a very great King,

11
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,875
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

12
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:06,459
is the ruler of the whole world.

13
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,917
So the father got worried,

14
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,959
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

15
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,459
into material life

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,459
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

17
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:32,209
So he built a very special place for Him,

18
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,125
a beautiful palace to live in.

19
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:44,084
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

20
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,709
was a very, very beautiful woman,

21
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,668
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

22
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:57,668
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,709
Also you know the story of His going

24
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:11,417
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

25
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:17,917
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

26
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,709
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

27
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,251
and ‘Why should people die?’.

28
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:33,292
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

29
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:37,334
and He started trying to understand

30
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,709
why these things happen to human beings.

31
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,292
With this the enquiry started.

32
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:49,917
So He reached a point where

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:57,251
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

34
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,584
that were entangled around him by His father.

35
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,334
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

36
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:12,251
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

37
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:20,292
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

38
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,626
for the search of the truth because

39
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,042
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

40
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:35,709
And so He started from collective towards the center.

41
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,334
When we see miseries all around us,

42
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,209
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

43
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,251
Will everybody get realization?

44
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,501
Will everybody will have this, you see?

45
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,000
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

46
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:56,334
first of all we must know, are we all right?

47
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,709
Have we - are we perfect?

48
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,750
Are we full of joy?

49
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,709
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

50
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,542
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

51
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,833
Because He started from the wrong point,

52
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,875
searching it from the collective

53
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,417
to remove the miseries of the people

54
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,875
He had to go in a very round about way.

55
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:32,542
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

56
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,542
He went to big pundits,

57
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:42,417
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

58
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:49,209
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

59
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:56,709
that is the ‘roga’, is the

60
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,833
health or miserable physical body,

61
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:09,542
then the death and the old age.

62
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,501
He went and asked so many people

63
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,792
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

64
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,584
And then they said that you have to

65
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:26,875
become old because you are born like that

66
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,626
and you have to suffer

67
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,084
because you commit sins.

68
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,209
He was not satisfied with this answer.

69
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,292
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

70
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:44,209
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

71
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:50,542
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

72
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,792
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,125
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

74
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:07,209
because He got so tired of His seeking.

75
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:10,459
And after the sleep He got up

76
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,542
and suddenly He got His Realization.

77
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:19,209
And He thought the whole drama is over.

78
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:24,459
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

79
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,417
and She died just after the birth of the child.

80
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:32,792
And He got His Realization.

81
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:37,209
Now at that time when He got His Realization

82
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:41,376
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

83
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:45,376
that what it means Realization is.

84
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:46,750
Nobody to decode

85
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,875
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

86
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:57,209
But because of His tremendous seeking

87
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,959
and such ardent desire

88
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:08,376
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

89
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,626
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

90
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,833
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

91
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,626
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

92
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:27,584
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

93
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:32,042
the need of the time had to act firstly,

94
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:39,000
secondly the need of the

95
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,875
incarnation to come on this earth

96
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:46,501
was first created in the human beings.

97
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,668
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

98
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,750
Brahmanism or priesthood

99
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,584
and people were trying to take everything

100
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:05,750
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

101
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:13,125
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

102
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:17,626
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

103
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,833
the puja and everything He canceled.

104
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,334
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

105
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:26,000
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

106
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,251
It's all a joke going on, you see.

107
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:34,167
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

108
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,125
that the whole world is a leela,

109
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:41,750
is a play of God's own whims.

110
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,709
So you just enjoy it.

111
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:50,709
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

112
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,626
which we had

113
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:57,209
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

114
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,167
You were there?

115
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,501
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

116
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,084
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

117
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,584
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

118
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:10,501
So in the same way when Buddha came in

119
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,584
first problem was that

120
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:17,917
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

121
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:21,501
Because in His search everybody told Him

122
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,584
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

123
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:30,042
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

124
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:32,750
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

125
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,042
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

126
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:38,042
“Where is the God?”

127
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,833
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

128
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,084
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

129
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,542
and nothing unusual I should say.

130
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,959
So this must be done by God, you see.

131
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,501
If you cut your throat:

132
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,750
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

133
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:05,125
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

134
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:08,459
Because everybody is going towards God.

135
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,292
Then the people whom He met they said,

136
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:14,042
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

137
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,792
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,959
Because he could mesmerize people,

139
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:23,125
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

140
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:26,709
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

141
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,959
because people take God in the hand and use it

142
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,709
for their own purpose,

143
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:36,376
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

144
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,125
and it’s God has

145
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,750
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

146
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,875
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

147
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:48,626
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

148
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,417
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

149
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,000
and just doing all these horrible things

150
00:10:55,334 --> 00:11:01,125
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

151
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:04,917
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

152
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,501
they shave it completely.

153
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,376
And they have to -

154
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:13,167
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

155
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,792
some walls of the temple.

156
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,792
And the ladies who shaved their heads

157
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:22,334
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

158
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:26,917
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

159
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,584
and the water is poured on them.

160
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,251
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

161
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:36,542
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

162
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,084
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

163
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,626
buckets after buckets.

164
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,334
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

165
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,917
you see one is finished then another one.

166
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,833
Poor ladies rolling like that,

167
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:53,709
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

168
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,792
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,251
And then later on you see they became modern,

170
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:04,376
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

171
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:08,501
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

172
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,042
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

173
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:17,125
and they sent it to England and other places.

174
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:22,251
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

175
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,750
ridiculous things were done!

176
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

177
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,376
The first step is Self-Realization.

178
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,750
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

179
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,709
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

180
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,459
first you get your Realization.

181
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:42,084
That was the first condition, establish it.

182
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:45,376
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

183
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:46,542
- nothing doing.

184
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:54,167
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

185
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,501
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

186
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,584
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

187
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,084
So all that He started

188
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:06,542
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

189
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,251
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

190
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,000
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

191
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,334
means the one who is a Realized soul.

192
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:22,376
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

193
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,750
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,292
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

195
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:36,251
You are all Buddhas because you know.

196
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,125
When you know, you are the Buddha.

197
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:43,959
Now without going into all that nonsense

198
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,917
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

199
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,584
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

200
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:55,459
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

201
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,542
Why? Because He started from the other side.

202
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:05,542
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

203
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:07,833
it would have been better.

204
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:12,501
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

205
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:19,709
Supposing you want to repair your house.

206
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,709
So you have to have instrument for that house.

207
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:27,792
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

208
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:33,167
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

209
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:37,042
So first you must practice on yourself.

210
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,542
Put your attention to yourself first.

211
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,709
Is also is a method by which you avoid

212
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,792
seeing the point,

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,417
seeing the reality,

214
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,917
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

215
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,750
So when your attention goes to other things, are

216
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,792
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,417
which must be corrected.

218
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,833
And that’s why

219
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,042
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

220
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,959
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

221
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,292
give up everything and get to Realization.

222
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,167
Because by giving up everything He realized

223
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,125
that it is He, who should achieve it.

224
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:25,167
It's a very circuitous way,

225
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,459
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

226
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:31,084
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

227
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:36,668
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

228
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:42,125
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

229
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,959
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

230
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:51,501
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

231
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,209
How do you renounce the world?

232
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,209
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

233
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:59,125
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

234
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,542
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

235
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,125
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

236
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,459
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

237
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,000
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

238
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,542
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

239
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,917
just going like this.

240
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,542
So you don't take anything from here.

241
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,959
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

242
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:29,626
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,668
has no meaning.

244
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:36,376
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,584
being becomes -

246
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,626
I don't know the English word for that

247
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,917
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

248
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:56,668
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

249
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,542
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

250
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,334
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

251
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:09,084
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

252
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:13,542
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

253
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:18,167
You can say the soap or something like that –

254
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,334
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

255
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,709
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

256
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,584
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

257
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,792
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,417
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

259
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,209
You just become like that.

260
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:40,668
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.
261
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:40,668
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

261
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,084
You are never stuck.

262
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:51,417
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

263
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,959
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

264
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:57,709
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

265
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,459
For example now see the light here,

266
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:06,251
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

267
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,668
It doesn’t stick to anything.

268
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,709
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,417
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,292
So this is what it is,

271
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,750
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

272
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:30,917
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

273
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:36,792
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

274
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,792
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,542
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

276
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,917
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

277
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,668
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

278
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,959
And nor can you love anyone because

279
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:56,125
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

280
00:18:56,334 --> 00:19:00,251
You see, because you are attached to someone,

281
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:04,709
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

282
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:10,000
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

283
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:13,584
So once you have attachment you have both things.

284
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,459
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

285
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:17,959
another moment you hate,

286
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,501
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

287
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:25,334
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

288
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:30,334
it is either getting attached mentally

289
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:33,833
or either getting detached mentally.

290
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:40,251
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

291
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,542
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

292
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,334
You cannot die together.

293
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,501
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

294
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:54,459
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

295
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,709
“Why all these things are caused?”

296
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:02,292
So he said, it is because of desire.

297
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:07,542
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

298
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:14,542
like the death, like the old age

299
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,668
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

300
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,833
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

301
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:28,792
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

302
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:34,542
Left side gives you death.

303
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:39,251
When the left side is very much used

304
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:43,417
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

305
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:48,459
When the left side is out, desire,

306
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:52,167
you also get sickness.

307
00:20:52,792 --> 00:21:00,626
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

308
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:06,668
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

309
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,875
but the left side is the originator.

310
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:13,459
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

311
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:18,209
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

312
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,917
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

313
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,668
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

314
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:32,417
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

315
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:36,167
then all these things are neutralized.

316
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:41,792
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

317
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,792
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

318
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,501
by which you don't get old,

319
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:53,334
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

320
00:21:53,542 --> 00:22:00,042
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

321
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,750
You become the Spirit.

322
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,334
When you want to die, you die.

323
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:08,125
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

324
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:14,334
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

325
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,084
That's what you take with you.

326
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:23,709
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

327
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,959
So what He tried to say was to build up

328
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:30,334
that we should not have any desires.

329
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,959
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

330
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:38,584
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

331
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:42,709
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

332
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:46,833
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

333
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,042
When you go on saying:

334
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:51,084
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

335
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:53,875
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

336
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:59,167
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

337
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:01,750
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

338
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,542
Say for example

339
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:06,084
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

340
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,542
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

341
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:11,209
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

342
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,042
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

343
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:17,042
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

344
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:23,000
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

345
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,875
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

346
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:27,334
But I think it is going too far.

347
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,334
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

348
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:33,750
Is a simple thing.

349
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,084
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

350
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,626
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

351
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:43,251
and neutralize all your left side.

352
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,584
You see the point now?

353
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:50,251
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

354
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:53,251
He was not. He was not an atheist.

355
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,292
But as a matter of policy,

356
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,251
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

357
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:06,917
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

358
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,709
because once you start the god business,

359
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:15,251
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

360
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,042
I mean, they become that!

361
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:22,209
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

362
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:24,209
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

363
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,417
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

364
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,501
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

365
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,459
sitting on a chariot.

366
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:35,792
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

367
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

368
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:42,584
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

369
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:45,084
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

370
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,833
of course horrid looking,

371
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:51,542
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

372
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,584
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

373
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,501
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

374
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,542
So He said: "All right put that out,

375
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:03,042
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

376
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:07,501
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

377
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,209
It helped that time very much,

378
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:14,376
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

379
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,750
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

380
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,167
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

381
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:25,000
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

382
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,833
Monday because of the moon,

383
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:31,750
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

384
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:35,959
and when do you eat your food?

385
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,042
If you have to achieve God then you have to

386
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,125
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

387
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,750
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,167
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

389
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:55,209
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

390
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:59,542
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

391
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:03,209
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

392
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,292
you are doing God's work

393
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,125
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

394
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,251
so half of your desires are finished.

395
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:14,376
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

396
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:17,875
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

397
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:23,501
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

398
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:29,542
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

399
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,292
whether he has a family or no family

400
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,833
makes no difference to a realized soul,

401
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,334
because he is not attached.

402
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:39,167
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

403
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,584
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

404
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,459
go to the Himalayas.

405
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:45,668
There, what he’ll do?

406
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:52,334
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

407
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:56,292
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

408
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:59,542
if he's an English man,

409
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,875
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

410
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,668
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

411
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,084
That’s typical!

412
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:14,833
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

413
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:18,000
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

414
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,334
is the word they will use.

415
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:22,750
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

416
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:26,709
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

417
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,459
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

418
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:37,000
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

419
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:41,833
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

420
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,833
The food should not be,

421
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:47,125
if possible just get it in its natural form.

422
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,542
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

423
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,626
It should be so blunt that

424
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:56,334
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

425
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:01,084
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

426
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,542
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

427
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,125
who are going now to Gobi desert.

428
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:09,000
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

429
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,417
let’s go to Gobi desert.

430
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,417
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

431
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:14,959
All these absurd ideas

432
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:19,668
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

433
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,209
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

434
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:28,292
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

435
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:33,334
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

436
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:39,750
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

437
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:46,833
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

438
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:52,125
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

439
00:28:52,334 --> 00:29:00,334
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

440
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:04,709
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

441
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,584
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

442
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:14,668
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

443
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,542
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

444
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:25,125
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

445
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,084
into problem and He died of that, you see.

446
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,000
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

447
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:33,959
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

448
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,376
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

449
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,875
or some sort of a thing.

450
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:42,875
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

451
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:46,334
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

452
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,584
You are attached inside.

453
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:52,417
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

454
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:58,084
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

455
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:02,542
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

456
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:05,833
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

457
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,501
can I become primitive?

458
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:10,084
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

459
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:14,417
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

460
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:17,709
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

461
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:22,292
if your Self comes into your attention.

462
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:27,376
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

463
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:32,376
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

464
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,125
everyone who came on this Earth,

465
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,917
people have really made a mess out of them.

466
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,792
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

467
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,417
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

468
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,709
It went into many formations.

469
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,792
But I heard from My son-in-law that

470
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,209
he went and visited some of the caves

471
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,833
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

472
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:01,709
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

473
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,875
so they had a very bad time.

474
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:05,833
And they used to live in the caves.

475
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:11,334
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

476
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:16,167
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

477
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,959
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

478
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,709
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

479
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:28,084
He has got that photographed.

480
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:31,875
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

481
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:35,251
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

482
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,501
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

483
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:44,501
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

484
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:50,209
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

485
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:54,459
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

486
00:31:54,668 --> 00:32:00,000
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

487
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,917
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

488
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:07,209
and he started the Zen system of religion,

489
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:10,167
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

490
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,959
That one was preserved.

491
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:18,875
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

492
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:22,417
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

493
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:26,833
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

494
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:30,209
So these two good things came out of Him.

495
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:35,542
While they searched back into the history of China

496
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:38,251
and they found out the Adishakti

497
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:42,417
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

498
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:46,584
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

499
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:50,501
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

500
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:55,167
Now then Buddha also got

501
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:58,459
into another form because

502
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,542
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

503
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,959
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

504
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,959
So they wanted to form,

505
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,709
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

506
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,125
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

507
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:19,875
as He has been and He will be.

508
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:25,875
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

509
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:28,668
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

510
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,501
and they started making His statues and everything.

511
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,334
So they made Buddha as the God.

512
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:40,626
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

513
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:44,084
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

514
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:47,709
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

515
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:51,042
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

516
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:53,584
you should not build any temples

517
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,833
so you see the loophole was found out,

518
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:59,292
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

519
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:05,000
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

520
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,833
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

521
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,292
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

522
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,709
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

523
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,251
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

524
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:17,792
They were very good disciples of His

525
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,542
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

526
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,292
and were put in the stupa.

527
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:28,584
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

528
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,626
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

529
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,584
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

530
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:39,334
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

531
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,542
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

532
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:45,709
Now the first casket was made of gold,

533
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,334
the second of silver, the third of iron,

534
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:54,459
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

535
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,959
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

536
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,376
because if you go on keeping like that,

537
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,542
some parts of the body of these great people,

538
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:09,167
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

539
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:12,084
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

540
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,709
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

541
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,833
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

542
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:22,917
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

543
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:25,125
to horrible human beeings.

544
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:30,000
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

545
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:33,417
of the person who died like divine person,

546
00:35:33,626 --> 00:35:37,376
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

547
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:43,292
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

548
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,875
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

549
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,709
and big ritual for the dead

550
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,167
and then they started going towards the dead.

551
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:54,875
So they started moving towards the left side.

552
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:58,334
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

553
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:04,251
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

554
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:07,709
because He is on the right side.

555
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:14,501
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

556
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,042
This was His idea.

557
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:20,542
Activate your right side without the desire.

558
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,376
This was His philosophy.

559
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:26,584
But they - all of them are left sided.

560
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:30,709
They have desires, not only desires

561
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:34,626
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

562
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:39,376
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

563
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:43,792
they think that you can

564
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,334
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

565
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:55,709
With this desire they will commit suicide.

566
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,167
To save their country they can commit suicide.

567
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,334
I mean it is absurd.

568
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:04,084
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

569
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,875
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

570
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:09,792
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

571
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,542
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

572
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,000
Even at the subtler point.

573
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,668
Even when we do puja,

574
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:22,875
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

575
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:27,709
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

576
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:34,709
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

577
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,209
The whole thing is done without any desire,

578
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,542
so there is no disappointment.

579
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,167
There is no unhappiness.

580
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:43,668
You are going to America,

581
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:49,709
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

582
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,750
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

583
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,292
Without any hope,

584
00:37:56,626 --> 00:38:01,334
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

585
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,084
but no desires.

586
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:07,542
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

587
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,459
that even if I have to desire for something

588
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:11,000
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

589
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,709
because I have lost the sense of desire.

590
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,125
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

591
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,709
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

592
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,917
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

593
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,376
because you see, I can't desire,

594
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,251
i really don't. I don't do anything!

595
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:29,542
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

596
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:33,376
I really don't do anything.

597
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:36,542
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

598
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,626
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

599
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:39,626
Still you are saying,

600
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:45,750
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

601
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,833
That is Tao.

602
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,459
If you read about Tao,

603
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:52,792
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

604
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,959
But everything works out.

605
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:00,251
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

606
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:02,833
that you have to be desireless

607
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,668
and do everything,

608
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:11,000
and He is the one who controls our ego.

609
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:16,251
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

610
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,626
Ego is only built up

611
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:22,334
when you have a desire to do something.

612
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:27,334
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

613
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,875
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

614
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:33,959
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

615
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:38,292
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

616
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,792
Not with the desire to achieve something.

617
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,875
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

618
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:47,376
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

619
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:51,084
But can be very, very gross also,

620
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,501
like some people can believe that, you see,

621
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:59,334
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

622
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:02,292
Or "I can sell it to somebody

623
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,042
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

624
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:08,833
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

625
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:12,626
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

626
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,459
there can be even worse desires than that,

627
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,084
can be very many.

628
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,792
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

629
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:24,125
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

630
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:30,167
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

631
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,501
not with any desires.

632
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,709
Just for the joy of it.

633
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,251
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

634
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:42,584
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

635
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,709
Just, just think of that!

636
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,292
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

637
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:51,084
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

638
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,459
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

639
00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:00,875
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

640
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,292
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

641
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:07,501
that we do everything without any desire,

642
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,917
we have got rid of all the ego.

643
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,709
The Buddha is awakened within us.

644
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,376
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

645
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,584
that He settled down Himself

646
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,501
in a place which is the most difficult place,

647
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,792
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

648
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,334
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

649
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:30,501
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

650
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:33,542
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

651
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:39,125
So this horrible point which is  -

652
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:43,167
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

653
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,626
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

654
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,792
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

655
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,167
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

656
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:58,833
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

657
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:03,417
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

658
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:07,042
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

659
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:10,042
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

660
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:13,042
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

661
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,542
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

662
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:19,334
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

663
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:22,584
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

664
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,251
which is the enlightenment,

665
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:28,709
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

666
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:33,833
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

667
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:37,709
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

668
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,417
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

669
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:49,626
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

670
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:57,042
It is to Virat we are doing.

671
00:42:57,251 --> 00:43:00,042
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

672
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:03,792
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

673
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,376
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

674
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,875
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

675
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,334
the religion - the balance.

676
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:14,542
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

677
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:16,709
or you can put it the other way round,

678
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:21,917
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

679
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,542
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

680
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,875
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

681
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:32,167
Not before that.

682
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,668
So these three things are to be achieved.

683
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:37,167
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

684
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:41,459
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

685
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:47,542
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

686
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,125
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

687
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:53,501
Is it virtuous to do like this?

688
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,251
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

689
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,875
You'll have no desires to do something,

690
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:00,084
that is not virtuous and righteous.

691
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:01,917
You will just not do it.

692
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:05,125
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

693
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:08,167
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

694
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,709
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

695
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,875
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

696
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:18,959
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

697
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:22,792
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

698
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,209
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

699
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:30,584
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

700
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,501
But what? Is the Spirit?

701
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:37,668
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

702
00:44:38,084 --> 00:44:41,334
to the whole, to the Virat.

703
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:44,334
This is the way we have to work it out.

704
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:47,042
So ultimately he reached the same point,

705
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,792
that let me start it from myself.

706
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,668
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

707
00:44:55,875 --> 00:45:00,376
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

708
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,668
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

709
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,875
First you get your Realization,all right,

710
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:13,875
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

711
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:18,626
Then you become collectively conscious.

712
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,917
Collectivity is a temperament,

713
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:28,459
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

714
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:36,792
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

715
00:45:38,709 --> 00:45:44,750
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

716
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:49,709
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

717
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:56,459
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

718
00:45:56,668 --> 00:46:00,417
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

719
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:05,042
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

720
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:10,125
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

721
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:15,584
All right. And if it is the heart

722
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:21,251
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

723
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:24,376
So if you can conquer your ego here,

724
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:30,209
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

725
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:33,334
You can manage that. But first start it here.

726
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,542
It has to reverse back you see, now

727
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,376
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

728
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:47,668
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

729
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:52,042
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

730
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:56,542
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

731
00:46:56,709 --> 00:47:02,417
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

732
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:07,459
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

733
00:47:07,668 --> 00:47:12,792
to get rid of this horrible ego.

734
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,417
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

735
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:23,626
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

736
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:44,125
It’s receding - ego.

737
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,833
English are wise people, sound people,

738
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,251
and they must understand this, that

739
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,292
is a very, very important thing

740
00:47:57,501 --> 00:48:00,334
that they should not loose these qualities

741
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:04,875
and should try to fix their enlightenment

742
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:10,292
in such a way that it circulates.

743
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:28,501
Any question?

744
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:34,209
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

745
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:36,668
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

746
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:41,709
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

747
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:23,125
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

748
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:31,459
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

749
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:36,167
which has no color.

750
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:40,417
And

751
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:47,792
there could be a personality which is colourless.

752
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:57,209
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

753
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:05,792
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

754
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,125
Whatever you do.

755
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:09,334
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

756
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,792
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

757
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,209
Is not a drama, is a fact.

758
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:23,668
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

759
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,334
For example, this is an artificial thing,

760
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,917
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

761
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,875
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

762
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:36,084
It's like that.

763
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:43,209
So if somebody is a real person

764
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:46,084
whatever he does is not a drama,

765
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,292
is reality.

766
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:51,000
That's how they say

767
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:53,917
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

768
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,750
people don't understand, how can

769
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,584
one person take so forms. Can.

770
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:01,542
if it is Reality, it can.

771
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:04,167
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

772
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:08,584
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

773
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,959
takes so many forms.

774
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:13,376
See Her power!

775
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:20,292
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

776
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:27,417
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

777
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:31,833
Because She is Reality.

778
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:36,792
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

779
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,959
But unreal things,

780
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,084
whatever you make out of unreal things,

781
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:51,459
they may look real, but they are not.

782
00:51:53,668 --> 00:51:57,376
So now, let us have the puja.

783
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,542
And for the rituals also He said,

784
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:03,709
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

785
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,668
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

786
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:13,750
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

787
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:16,709
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

788
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,417
or any Deity who is unreal

789
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:20,292
or those who were not real people

790
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,084
and the Realized Souls.

791
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:24,417
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

792
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:28,376
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

793
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,917
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

794
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:33,501
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

795
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:35,000
please don't bring them for puja.

796
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:37,875
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

797
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:41,292
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

798
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:43,334
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

799
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,251
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

800
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:47,459
by coming here without Realisation.

801
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:51,209
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

802
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:54,959
They don't help Me.

803
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,875
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

804
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:06,459
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

805
00:53:06,668 --> 00:53:09,917
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

806
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:11,959
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

807
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,917
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

808
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,292
Is better not to do such a thing.

809
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:22,167
Because also such a person is half baked.

810
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:25,750
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

811
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:28,668
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

812
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,334
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

813
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,959
it's spoilt for ever.

814
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:36,417
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

815
00:53:36,709 --> 00:53:41,084
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

816
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:41,833
All right?

817
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:46,000
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

818
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:48,334
I know you do it out of compassion,

819
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:53,833
but this is not wise.

820
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,542
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

821
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,709
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

822
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:04,000
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

823
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:07,501
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

824
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:11,167
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

825
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:15,209
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

826
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:18,334
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

827
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,542
You remember your friend had the same problem

828
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,833
who was he? Nick or something...

829
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:24,792
All right.

830
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:28,687
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.
