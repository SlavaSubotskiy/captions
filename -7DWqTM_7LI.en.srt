1
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:08,715
So, today is the second day of Navaratri.

2
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:16,595
I told you yesterday that first the auspiciousness

3
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:23,788
and the holiness was created through the creation of Shri Ganesha.

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,448
So that this world is fulfilled with auspiciousness and holiness.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,550
We can see in the history

6
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:38,136
that people in the olden times cared for auspiciousness

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:42,706
and were afraid of God, they had fear for God

8
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:46,140
and they didn’t challenge God at all.

9
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:55,558
But gradually, the evil took over

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,741
and so this auspiciousness and holiness started

11
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,644
getting – not exhausted – but sleeping off.

12
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:13,220
So Ganesha started sleeping, and as Ganesha sleeps

13
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:17,556
the people are not afraid of God.

14
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,993
They think they can do what they like:

15
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:27,380
what can God do, after all, who is He? We don’t see it.

16
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:33,396
They also have no gratitude for what God has done for you.

17
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:42,126
They have no gratitude about the blessings of this universe

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,115
that he was created, all the beauty that God gave you

19
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:56,868
because they’re ignorant and in ignorance they forget everything.

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,599
Now the problem started more when Ganesha started sleeping.

21
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:11,892
With his power, people were afraid of God, they were righteous,

22
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:17,302
they wanted to be good people, they didn’t want to commit sins,

23
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,798
they didn’t want to do wrong things,

24
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,539
they wanted to keep their attention clean

25
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,371
and put attention to good things.

26
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:32,527
Such people existed because you can see the temples,

27
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,042
the big churches,

28
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:39,398
the big mosques that were built in the name of God.

29
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,441
And they didn’t have so much money, nothing

30
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,229
but just out of devotion they did it.

31
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:48,664
So, they had devotion for God.

32
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:56,308
Another side was that people like we can say, the people

33
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:03,047
who were searching God were trying to find out the ways and methods

34
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:11,829
how they could reach God and there was such a big search.

35
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:16,923
They didn’t want material things, they didn’t care for it.

36
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,880
I mean, for them, it was too low to think of it.

37
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,855
But gradually so, it happened

38
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:35,014
that these simple needs of life became very complicated,

39
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:49,683
then first they had started to fight with each other.

40
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,939
And then when they fight with each other it was out of selfishness,

41
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:03,136
it was all kind of uncollective temperament that they developed

42
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:08,079
may be food, maybe some material thing,

43
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:12,242
all these things started crawling up into their ignorance.

44
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,459
As a result, they became very blind

45
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:27,047
and gradually they became sub-human, barbaric.

46
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:33,607
So, the second phase started where

47
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,665
just after the vegetation and everything was created,

48
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:45,521
the fire of the Mother Earth started coming out as an anger

49
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:52,200
for these animals that they grew up,

50
00:04:52,572 --> 00:05:01,200
also were very-very dangerous type and were troublesome,

51
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,340
who were in the evolutionary process

52
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:07,504
were very-very big sized very big sized things,

53
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:14,790
but not intelligent. Extremely cruel and big sized animals.

54
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:19,904
All these evolutionary processes start but before that,

55
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:32,872
only the Mother Earth’s fire started burning the stone inside.

56
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:38,380
Because as I told you first it was taken nearer the Sun,

57
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,251
this Mother Earth, and then towards the Moon.

58
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,021
So that the upper crust, though it was

59
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,361
it had become cooled down and it had formed ice

60
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:52,786
and then it melted away into the water, still the inside,

61
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:58,274
inside the ocean, the Mother Earth was very hot.

62
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,665
And that She started coming out.

63
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,402
And when this heat started coming it burned

64
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,289
many trees and many stones,

65
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,423
with that burning, carbon was formed.

66
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:20,580
Now, this carbon started absorbing

67
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,945
all the gazes that were outside

68
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:31,101
and purifying the atmosphere quite a lot.

69
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,989
Plus, this carbon is the basis of our organic chemistry.

70
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,426
So first the in-organic chemistry was there

71
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:43,723
in the sense chemicals were produced

72
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:48,804
and then with the carbon started the organic chemistry

73
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:53,283
and that’s the beginning of life we should say

74
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:58,908
because then nitrogen it started absorbing

75
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,400
and they formed amino acids.

76
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:07,580
These amino acids are the basis of life.

77
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,959
So that is how the life started.

78
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,904
But the first life grew in the water

79
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:19,103
and you know the whole evolutionary process how it took place

80
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,400
in the second centre, Swadhisthana

81
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:26,326
which had created all the universes and all that,

82
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:34,529
all around in the Mother Earth there was water and

83
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:40,330
on that surface of Mother Earth life started growing

84
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,572
then the evolutionary took place.

85
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:46,146
Evolutionary process took place in this Bhavasagara,

86
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:51,146
till we come to the human stage as I told you

87
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,861
there were animals first who came up

88
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,654
in the evolutionary process,

89
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,971
they grew up and they grew

90
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:03,315
very big then they had to become small,

91
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,628
then they became very cunning,

92
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:08,362
all kinds of things happened in the evolutionary process,

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,315
left and right, right and left.

94
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:13,147
Ultimately a human being was created

95
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:18,061
He too was in the image – not of God at that time,

96
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:24,526
but in the image of an animal because the animal has – hum,

97
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,659
he has come from the animal stage,

98
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,827
but God created later man into the image of Himself

99
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:43,999
in the sense is, out of these barbaric models –

100
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:48,097
we call them we call them half-man, half-this thing,

101
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:52,374
like you can say the monkeys becoming man.

102
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:55,334
Then He created something –

103
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:01,252
you can call it as Adam and Eve before, two models.

104
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:06,077
So this was all done at that time,

105
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:10,549
as you know that Adam and Eve are symbolic

106
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:19,413
two personalities who wanted to know what is good and what is bad.

107
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,413
And because of this urge to find out,

108
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,749
that we can find, we can,

109
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,922
also in the search of God many people think there’s no need to have

110
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:37,394
any advice from any Realized soul,

111
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:41,113
we can do it ourselves, what is the need

112
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:45,468
to have Mother to tell us anything, we can do it ourselves.

113
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:48,920
So they wanted to keep themselves on their own.

114
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,881
So God said: “All right, you go ahead.”

115
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:55,600
And that’s how the circle started

116
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:58,882
in the search of the truth. And as you know

117
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,030
we are here today enlightened.

118
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,866
So then enlightenment has come to you,

119
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:13,233
ultimately, but one had to go through

120
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:20,147
the desert, the darkness of ignorance and then come to this stage.

121
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:25,909
Then the state came in that we needed somebody to lead us,

122
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,683
as somebody’s needed in the process of you can call it the

123
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:47,550
evolution, one fish came out and crawled and became a reptile,

124
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:53,936
in the same way, you needed every time some leader to come out

125
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,604
to raise you higher and higher and higher.

126
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,444
So the first incarnation, I would say, was that of the Goddess.

127
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:08,870
She was the first who came to lead people towards God.

128
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:19,413
Because if you see in the Void, we have this chakra of Swadhistana

129
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:26,854
and we have also the great Gurus, prophets who came

130
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:32,967
to try to save human beings. But this was later.

131
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:39,999
Before came the Goddess, to save people from

132
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:47,967
all these ways of destruction.

133
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,674
Some had become very evil

134
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:55,131
people who were called as Rakshasas, devils

135
00:11:55,855 --> 00:12:00,796
and some were, had become good people.

136
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:08,389
Out of them then the Goddess created these great saints,

137
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,846
they worshipped the Mother and they become

138
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,869
great saints then became incarnations of saintliness.

139
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:20,021
So the first incarnation that ever came was that of the Goddess.

140
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:27,107
And we see, on the second Yuga that we can call, She came.

141
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:33,240
She came before Shri Krishna, She came before Shri Rama

142
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:41,619
and She saved people from getting drowned into Bhavasagara.

143
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:48,748
This then created great saints and sages and Gurus

144
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:53,357
who tried to save people.

145
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:58,963
We have Gurus who were very great,

146
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:03,591
I should say saints and very evolved,

147
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,673
but also we had some who were right-sided,

148
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:09,408
who knew all kinds of

149
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:14,170
Vedas, they knew all kinds of sciences, they knew all kinds of

150
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:19,912
– you can call them the divine weapons and things like that.

151
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:23,228
And we also had left-sided

152
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:27,287
Gurus who believed in the devotion,

153
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:35,434
like you can say Moses was there, Abraham, Moses all these,

154
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:40,941
people came who were left-sided, Muhammad was there,

155
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:45,410
one of the last ones you can say and then Nanaka [Sainath].

156
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:51,328
So came the devotion to God, devotion to the

157
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,725
All-pervading Power started like this.

158
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:03,928
So in this stage, that people tried to murder these

159
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,088
great saints like Socrates, like

160
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,822
we know everybody had to suffer so much

161
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,673
because nobody

162
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:18,278
in the collective liked saints or goodness or righteousness.

163
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,122
That’s how we had fallen down so much

164
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,466
at the time as you on the time

165
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,792
of Moses what happened.

166
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,590
And all these things

167
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,166
like “shariat” and all that has come from Moses,

168
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,549
but the Muslims are following it.

169
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:40,955
And that time it was such a bad decadent society

170
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,135
that they had to use these methods

171
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:50,244
of very strong punishment or banishment you can call it,

172
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:55,861
so that people were afraid not to do anything that is
sinful or else.

173
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,765
But now they’ve taken up by

174
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,929
the Muslims, the Muslims are using that scripture there,

175
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,451
they have no right, they are no saints,

176
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:08,407
they’re not Gurus, nothing and they cannot use this.

177
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,148
But they started using it.

178
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,192
But as you see our society, some of our Western societies,

179
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:21,566
have really become very decadent and are going down.

180
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:28,988
So now it is for us who are enlightened people to awaken others

181
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,480
to reality

182
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,737
to make them face up to recede

183
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:36,128
that where are they?

184
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:40,080
In the name of pleasures, enjoyment, indulgences,

185
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,572
how they’re destroying themselves?

186
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:45,057
You have to talk to them, you have to tell them,

187
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,799
you have to awaken them and that’s why

188
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:49,861
now we are going to protest also in Paris.

189
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:58,478
The basic thing we have to understand,

190
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,727
that we have a very, very big responsibility.

191
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,127
At the time

192
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:10,502
when the Goddess incarnated, She had just to save people

193
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:15,041
from the cruelties of these devils, that’s all.

194
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,845
Because devils were on one side, Goddess was on another side.

195
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,125
She was very powerful. She was killing

196
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,719
all the devils and all demons.

197
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:31,961
But now in modern times, it becomes a very delicate work

198
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,880
because these devils have entered

199
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,294
into the brains of all the sadhakas.

200
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,185
I’ve seen even people who were born Realized

201
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,224
were indulging into all kinds of

202
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,435
wrong things because of the society.

203
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,708
So many went to horrible Gurus and

204
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,723
they had those bhoots in their heads.

205
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,325
So, it’s a very intricate operation one has to perform

206
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,746
to take out these things.

207
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,809
And that lingers on and still, it puts doubts in their heads

208
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,262
and also curbs your strength to fight it.

209
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,918
But as Sahaja Yogis, you have a tremendous responsibility

210
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,249
and you must try to clear out yourself

211
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,772
of all these conditionings, of all these

212
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,217
wrong ideas that the society has spread so far.

213
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,998
So, one side the evolution went wrong, now

214
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:26,170
 it has gone down.

215
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,272
The decadence has started, people are just getting ruined

216
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:36,326
and living with unnatural things, with materialistic things

217
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:42,365
and people are becoming extremely selfish

218
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:48,641
 also deceitful, not afraid of God.

219
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,899
Even the priests, even the churches, even the temples, even the

220
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:59,327
mosques, all these people who are representing God are crooked.

221
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,218
They’re criminals, they’re not afraid of God.

222
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:07,968
So, the first thing one has to understand that

223
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:12,257
if we are not afraid of God,

224
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:17,199
we cannot work out. Human beings only work under two circumstances:

225
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,318
one either fear,

226
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:23,369
either there should be fear or there should be some temptation.

227
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:26,031
 Otherwise, nothing can work out.

228
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,737
But the fear of God is the most important thing

229
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:35,295
that we should not do anything that may displease God by any means.

230
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,064
We have to be very, very careful on this point

231
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:42,833
because first of all we are very complicated personalities,

232
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,674
we’ve got these bhoots in our heads,

233
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:47,486
we’ve got these ideas in our heads.

234
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:52,620
Like in Germany when first, I think,

235
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,994
Grégoire went there and told them that,

236
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,844
“You can’t have licentious life anymore, now you’re Sahaja Yogis “.

237
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:01,005
They said, ” Of course, we’re Sahaja Yogis

238
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,226
that dons’t mean we have given up our lives “.

239
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,324
” You have to. You have to change “.

240
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,443
So, three hundred people went away from Sahaja Yoga,

241
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:09,628
[Inaudible]

242
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,661
But then came in Mr Aids,

243
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,802
they were all panicked by this.

244
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,685
So, these warnings are coming to us

245
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,521
Thinking too much, dominating others, right sidedness,

246
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,402
now first time is leading you to yuppie stage.

247
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:33,168
And in this stage, in this disease,

248
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:36,144
outwardly nothing happens but you start reducing,

249
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:40,129
you become like a reptile, people have to carry you on your back,

250
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:43,507
just like a reptile, like a fish.

251
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:49,637
Left-sided, you know already, you know the cancer and all these

252
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,613
incurable diseases come from the left side.

253
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:56,809
So, this onslaught I would say, such a big attack

254
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,012
of the negativity is more felt in Kali Yuga

255
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,056
than anywhere before. Because now you have to think

256
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:07,453
as to what is missing in our society,

257
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,431
what we have to do about it,

258
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,626
and that we have got luckily this

259
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,514
Chaitanya with us.

260
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,724
How can we help society?

261
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:21,279
So, we have to widen our vision and think about it.

262
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,137
It’s not this time that

263
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:26,371
only the Goddess has to save you from the evil.

264
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:29,199
It’s much more than that.

265
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,599
She has given you powers.

266
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,316
And these powers are to be used.

267
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,800
Instead of that if you are still lurking with all these old things,

268
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:40,269
how can you have the powers?

269
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:45,769
So, one of the Gurus, we should say one of the last Gurus was

270
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,573
Mohammad Sahab and then Nanaka.

271
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:52,034
And both of them have said one thing

272
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:55,738
is you must surrender. Islam means surrender.

273
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,066
You must surrender. But they don’t.

274
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,941
I’ve seen people don’t surrender; they still stick onto things.

275
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:05,925
Say, I told people you must put oil.

276
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,038
They’ll not put oil.

277
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:11,827
Because nobody puts oil so they’re not putting oil in their heads.

278
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,460
Then they’ll become bald-headed,

279
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,374
they come to me: “Mother we’ve lost our hair”.

280
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,905
You put on oil! I’ve told you to put on oil.

281
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,975
Why don’t you put on oil? They won’t just do anything

282
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:25,428
because the rest of the people don’t put on oil, we should not put.

283
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,124
You are not them; you are different. Try to understand

284
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,960
you are not the other people. You are the leaders

285
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,857
and you shouldn’t follow them, they should follow you.

286
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,694
Instead of that, you are following all

287
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,155
the general opinion of the people and you want to live like them,

288
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,219
then how can you be a saint?

289
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,966
A saint lives like the way
he has to live because he has the wisdom.

290
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,052
And that is what you have to understand,

291
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,880
that all these ideas have gone into your head

292
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:10,435
and it’s a very dedicate operation for Me.

293
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:12,930
Even to tell you something.

294
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:15,579
If I tell something to the ladies they’ll start crying.

295
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,459
If I tell something to men, they’ll leave Sahaja Yoga

296
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,748
as if they’re obliging Me, is wrong.

297
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,888
What you have to do is that God has chosen you

298
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,638
to be the leaders of the people.

299
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:31,334
To be the leaders. Do you know you are going to be the leaders?

300
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:35,099
And then how a leader should be?

301
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,967
It should be a model.

302
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:42,157
And that’s why in the Islam

303
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,407
or in Nanaka, praises complete surrender.

304
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,935
What you surrender is nothing but this Ego and these

305
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:50,177
conditionings, these nonsensical ideas.

306
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,036
And that you have to surrender.

307
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,589
That’s very important and surprisingly

308
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:57,682
how Mohammad has said

309
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,478
that Islam is to surrender,

310
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:01,728
must be the reason he must be knowing

311
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:06,328
that now ego is going to overpower the left side.

312
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,291
We are not ordinary people.

313
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,774
How many people know how to raise Kundalini?

314
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:24,730
But still, I see people do not know on the feet where is the,

315
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,433
where are the chakras are there.

316
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,949
Simple, simple things they don’t know.

317
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:32,855
I don’t know what time,

318
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,355
where they spend their time, what do they talk.

319
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,691
The other day I asked these Indian girls what are the

320
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:41,590
stones that are for all these.

321
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,808
They didn’t know, I ‘m surprised, none of them knew.

322
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,605
They’re Indians, I mean, I thought they should know all that.

323
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:50,754
It’s all there,

324
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,972
but they don’t know that. I don’t know what,

325
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,964
morning till evening they’re talking but what do they talk?

326
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:57,816
You should find out.

327
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:02,862
It’s all I’ve said it, it’s all in the – in what you call this

328
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:08,271
– on the tape, finished. That’s all.

329
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,590
This knowledge should be in your brain

330
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:14,841
and the vibrations should be in your hearts.

331
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:18,557
So, Navaratri is a big preparation.

332
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,830
We have to know that

333
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,346
the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga has to come into us,

334
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:27,955
otherwise, why will people ask- think that you are saints?

335
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,148
Nobody’s going to believe it

336
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,226
that you are saints,

337
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,245
in your behaviour, in your knowledge,

338
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,939
in your dealing with others.

339
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:44,050
In everything a Sahaja Yogi should be something outstanding.

340
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:45,956
When I said,

341
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:49,596
“You have become, you all have to become your own masters”.

342
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,705
Then they use it the other way round.

343
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,604
They tell the leader: “Now we have become our own masters”.

344
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,063
It’s not the way.

345
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,507
So, the first thing is wisdom,

346
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:03,358
wisdom to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

347
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,030
Assume the power.

348
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:08,202
Sometimes I feel as if a

349
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,562
 beggar is made a king supposing;

350
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,796
still he doesn’t assume his position.

351
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,437
Anybody coming he says, “Can you give me one penny?”

352
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,514
Though he’s a king.

353
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,490
Something like that.

354
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:28,484
Now you have to become the leaders of the world,

355
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,500
all over the world

356
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,984
and this is something to be assumed

357
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:36,625
and felt. It’s not ego, it’s a reality.

358
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:41,218
Because once you know that it is the reality

359
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:43,164
you immediately change yourself.

360
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:47,304
Immediately you will think that, “Now, what are we doing?

361
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:52,015
How much do we know?

362
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:56,234
We are the leaders, the responsibility’s ours”.

363
00:25:58,102 --> 00:26:02,187
If that is understood, you’ll be surprised that

364
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:08,398
nothing is needed to work out your cleansing.

365
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,882
Just automatically it will work,

366
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:14,890
that’s My blessing to you. Accept it.

367
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:18,630
But you must

368
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:22,232
feel that, “I have to be all right”, you have to feel it.

369
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,709
The situation becomes helpless for Me sometimes,

370
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,611
if I tell something to somebody they’ll start crying

371
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,205
or they’ll run away from Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,626
So, what am I to do?

373
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,462
Should I leave you at the same stage as it is?

374
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,992
Now, to save you from evil

375
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:41,383
is not the same as to fight

376
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,359
Mahishasura or Narakasura, not that way.

377
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:46,843
Because Narakasura is also gone into your head

378
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,336
and Mahishasura is also gone into your head.

379
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:54,089
So, the only thing one has to do is to understand, “There is

380
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:58,128
this one in me, I ask that to get out”.

381
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,128
Once you work it out that way,

382
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:03,683
you are doing Navaratri itself.

383
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:05,480
You have got powers,

384
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:08,839
you have the knowledge, you know you can feel it.

385
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:11,019
Just take out all these conditionings:

386
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,183
we are something different.

387
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:18,332
You are not ordinary people.

388
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:24,855
You are something very special.

389
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,827
And why should we, at all,

390
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:30,320
behave like others

391
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:33,148
or like the way others behave? You’re not like others.

392
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:37,562
And what a big thing you have, what a big knowledge you have!

393
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,093
Look at Christ, He was alone.

394
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:44,038
He talked about what he wanted to say to multitudes, he talked.

395
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,703
He was crucified, still, He talked.

396
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:50,077
Till the end.

397
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:54,746
But He was knowledgeable

398
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:59,433
and you might say that Mother he was an incarnation, all right.

399
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,051
But in no way you are less now:

400
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,074
you know how to raise the Kundalini, you know everything.

401
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:07,776
You are my children.

402
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,566
So, I would suggest that

403
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,082
to develop wisdom, you must meditate

404
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:16,801
and be in the centre,

405
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,761
so all these things will go away:

406
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,418
just be away from this nonsense.

407
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:27,202
In what atmosphere we live, what we do, it’s not important.

408
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:34,381
We have to know that we are something exceptional.

409
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:39,553
All the Ganas, all the angels are just waiting- [end of recording].
