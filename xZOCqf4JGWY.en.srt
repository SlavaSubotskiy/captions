1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,480
We must know that Sahaja Yoga is a living
process.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:20,060
It is the same type of a process by which
a seed sprouts into a tree.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,770
It is a living process.

4
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:33,480
So it is God’s job.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,539
I mean He has to do it.

6
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,539
It is not your job.

7
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,924
To sprout the seed is His job.

8
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:52,170
But the problem comes in because, at this
stage where human being is the seed, he has

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,210
freedom, they have freedom.

10
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:03,410
With that freedom they can spoil His manifestation,
His working.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,280
So the first thing one has to remember that
we must have wisdom about it.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:17,409
The first point of wisdom is that it is God
Almighty who is going to do this job.

13
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,939
We are not doing it.

14
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:28,950
You cannot sprout the seed, then how can you
sprout your seed also?

15
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:41,969
And in that wisdom we must learn one thing
and know, within ourselves, that you are part

16
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,200
and parcel of the whole process.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:55,810
Though you have your own freedom, freedom
also is a part and parcel of the same process.

18
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,920
You are not separated from God.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,039
You do not have any separated entity.

20
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,549
You are part and parcel of that whole process.

21
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,549
Alright?

22
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:13,000
So to think that you have to decide something
about it is also wrong.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,450
You are in the same machinery, brought to
this stage when you are given freedom for

24
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,890
your further evolution.

25
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:30,740
So at this stage, when you have your freedom,
you must know that freedom wants to be given

26
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,840
to you to understand the value of freedom.

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,020
And in that freedom, you must understand what
is glorious for you.

28
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,579
Once you understand that, then you tell yourself
that, “Now, see: I have to become something

29
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,579
more.

30
00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:01,900
That’s why God has done this, only thing
I have to do is to completely coordinate,

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,819
cooperate and surrender to His will, so that
I become."

32
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,100
This is the first preparation we have to make.

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:26,780
In that surrendering, you will do the greatest
thing because by that you do not interfere

34
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,989
with His work.

35
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:37,730
Unless and until you surrender you cannot
have the wisdom.

36
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,159
So first of all you understand this, through
your little wisdom that you have, and then

37
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,890
you’ll have the full wisdom.

38
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,019
First of all, understand this with the little
wisdom that you have, that, without surrendering

39
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,890
you will be obstructing the ways of God.

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,890
He knows what is good for you.

41
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:04,999
He wants to give you the highest which you
cannot achieve yourself.

42
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:09,230
He’s going to give you the highest.

43
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,439
If you want to achieve it, you cannot achieve
it.

44
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,060
It is His doing.

45
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,799
It is His daan (दान), as you call it,
His gift to you.

46
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:31,740
In that case you must know that [the] best
way to achieve it is to allow His working

47
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,590
to work out.

48
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:45,660
Now when you think of surrendering, first
of all the brain wave starts working.

49
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,990
“What do I surrender?”

50
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,590
You think by surrendering, say, your material
wealth.

51
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,590
That’s not what He wants.

52
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,590
It’s all wealth He has given to you.

53
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,430
What is He going to do [with that]?

54
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,419
It’s [not] equal to even a dust particle
of His feet.

55
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:15,840
So that one is not going to help.

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:34,349
Sometimes you may feel that, “I should give
my intelligence,” or that is what is asked.

57
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,379
Nobody wants to have your idiots and stupid
people!

58
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:44,270
So you don’t give up your intelligence.

59
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,150
Then some people think that, “I give up
my heart."

60
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,580
Some people say it.

61
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,430
We don’t want heartless people either.

62
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:09,340
Then some people will say that, “Mother,
we’ll give up our relationships with others."

63
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,410
That also is not needed.

64
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,599
Because your heart should be there where it
is and the light has to come in your heart.

65
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,080
What can you give your heart to whom?

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,810
When the One who has given you the heart,
what’s the use of giving Him back the heart?

67
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,810
Isn’t it?

68
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:37,629
The One who has given you intelligence, what’s
the use of giving Him [it back]?

69
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,830
Something that you have achieved yourself
has to be given.

70
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,880
What have you achieved is your ego and your
super-ego.

71
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,550
What you have achieved is nothing but your
ego.

72
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,110
And this ego you have to give up, which is
a difficult task.

73
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:08,340
Ego, if it comes out of money, material things,
it is better you give up some material things,

74
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,530
not to God but somebody else.

75
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,009
It’s better.

76
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,939
If the material things are creating that ego.

77
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:24,780
If your intelligence is creating ego that
you think you have a very high IQ, it’s

78
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,530
better to bring it down a little.

79
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,610
It is for you to judge.

80
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:41,789
Watch yourself: what makes your ego bloated
up?

81
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:52,180
If you could start looking at your ego you
will be amazed that any useless thing can

82
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,780
bloat it and can also deflate it.

83
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,490
It can get hurt from nothing at all.

84
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,610
It becomes so important.

85
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,409
Then the superego part of it also comes.

86
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:13,800
That is what also you have to give up.

87
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,979
And in superego you can have your conditionings
due to your gurus and wrong types of doings

88
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,199
and wrong types of conditionings [that] you
have had from childhood.

89
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,070
Like, for example, somebody is a Catholic:
for him, Pope is everything.

90
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,940
Or somebody is a Hindu: for him a particular
temple is everything.

91
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,900
All these are conditionings.

92
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,200
Why they are conditionings [is] that, without
finding out the truth about them, you have

93
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,500
just accepted them as it is.

94
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,840
This is the simple thing.

95
00:08:52,840 --> 00:09:01,020
So if you can find out the truth about all
these things, you will give it up.

96
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,270
You may, may not.

97
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,790
There are many people who know the truth,
still they do not give up.

98
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,340
You see, human beings are complicated stuff.

99
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,560
Even if they know the truth they will not
give up.

100
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,790
But supposing you try to find the truth about
all these things: then you may give, may not

101
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,790
give.

102
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,750
But going back into the whole thing, to find
out each and every thing, make a schedule

103
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,960
of the whole thing that, ‘’Morning time
I’ll find out about this, and evening time

104
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,020
about this,” The whole [of] your life you
will go on finding one by one, and ultimately

105
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,580
you will find that you have gone now up to
the grave.

106
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,200
So that procedure also is not going to help
you.

107
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,410
By God’s grace you are Realised-souls and
you can find out in a second whether you are

108
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,840
on the conditioning side or not.

109
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,290
If your left is catching you are conditioned.

110
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:05,010
If your right is catching you are on ego trip.

111
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,010
Alright.

112
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:12,170
So now you know very simple method is to know
that, through vibrations, you can find out

113
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,320
[if] Mr Ego is there or superego is there
or you are wobbly.

114
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:30,900
This is the biggest thing we have got because
this is my preparation.

115
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:40,460
My preparation is this, that, first give you
Realisation.

116
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,410
First give you Realisation.

117
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,870
Once you are Realised then I won’t have
to say much.

118
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,170
If you are conditioned on the left side you
will get pains, this, that.

119
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,640
If you are conditioned [on] right-hand side
you’ll have problems with health or something.

120
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,750
So you will come to me and I will be able
to tell you.

121
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:18,920
This is my own preparation: is to make you
alert and aware so that you have light to

122
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,170
see things.

123
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,060
Now your preparation should be to use this
awareness all the time.

124
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,650
Further I will go to say that: to use this
knowledge within you all the time.

125
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:42,680
That people forget.

126
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:52,160
So the first [thing] we must know is that
this preparation has been done for us.

127
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:01,080
We have got the vibrations.

128
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:12,520
We have got the knowledge to verify and we
must use this.

129
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,200
That you are in a new dimension is the first
acceptance.

130
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,630
If you have that acceptance within you then
your judgement will be better.

131
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,790
But this acceptance is missing.

132
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:35,520
Now there is, in Sanskrit, a word, ‘abhyas’
, that every day doing the same thing in that

133
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,370
manner you will remember that you are Realised
and that your awareness is not that of the

134
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,490
awareness of ordinary people.

135
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:55,280
So, first preparation is to prepare yourself,
to tell yourself that you have this new awareness

136
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:01,820
within you, is to make yourself known.

137
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,680
You see, in the University when you graduate,
there is a ceremony held for that.

138
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,870
You have to go with a gown and they give you
a proper roll and all that.

139
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,050
Why is it necessary?

140
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,810
Because you may forget you are a graduate.

141
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,110
(laughter) Yes!

142
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,340
And that’s exactly what happens to you,
that you forget you are Realised-souls.

143
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:40,080
I mean, we have had a ceremony in the sense
that everything we have done to prove that

144
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
you are Realised-souls.

145
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:50,440
But this is what is missing from our people,
that they cannot understand that they are

146
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,890
Realised-souls, that they are people who are
on a level that nobody [else] is.

147
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:06,800
You are twice-born people, who are very, very
rare.

148
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,340
Very rarely you will find people who are twice-born.

149
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,500
I mean, I found nobody – can you imagine?

150
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,791
– all my lifetime, except for my father
and a few here and there.

151
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:28,020
I mean they are not to be counted because
my father I chose and that’s how.

152
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:37,500
So, first of all if you make yourself known
to your own intelligence that, “I am a Realised-soul!”

153
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,470
you’ll be seeing that your priorities will
be changing very fast.

154
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:53,760
Supposing somebody gives you a huge big property
or a huge big wealth.

155
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,550
Immediately you become conscious of it.

156
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,350
You start walking like this.

157
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,930
When you are a student you walk like this.

158
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,690
Suddenly you get the degree and walk like
this.

159
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,180
(laughter) What about Realisation?

160
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,360
So happy to see you here, very happy.

161
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,050
May God Bless.

162
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,300
What about your Realisation?

163
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,800
You haven’t got your Realisation?

164
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,990
Then what are you doing about it?

165
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:38,750
This is the first preparation: is of identifying
that you are a Realised-soul.

166
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,910
We have to talk in a different way – we
are Realised-souls now.

167
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,300
We are people of a different knowledge.

168
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,270
We are people of a different awareness.

169
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,130
As I told you.

170
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,340
Now see this beautiful building: we all are
enamoured by it and it looks very beautiful.

171
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,500
It’s done so well, beautifully and is very
important for human beings.

172
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Alright?

173
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:09,490
But for the Divine even this green leaf is
more important than the whole building put

174
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,690
together and all such buildings put together.

175
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,190
For the Divine.

176
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:20,880
Because that leaf is living and a bird which
is more aware than that leaf is, is much more

177
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
important to the Divine.

178
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,320
So you, the human beings who are now aware
to this extent how much important you must

179
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
be to Divine?

180
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,900
How much God Himself must be interested in
you?

181
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,730
Just think of it!

182
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:49,880
Once you recognise this point, then relatively
you will also know that you are very important

183
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,780
in God’s plan.

184
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,110
Not world’s plan I am talking.

185
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,320
(laughter) It is God’s plan.

186
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,319
So all the forces of his blessings and all
his loftiness, all of them are with to help

187
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,169
you, to support you, to give you whatever
you like.

188
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:19,069
You are on the stage and they are looking
after you.

189
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:26,039
I mean, now you have entered on the stage.

190
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:37,870
But I find Sahaja Yogis, once they get Realisation,
I don’t know what happens to them.

191
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,210
If they give up their ego then they become
like, absolutely, I don’t know what you

192
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,860
call them…bananas?

193
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
(laughter)

194
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:54,850
Each one of you is the special one created
by God.

195
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:04,080
Now you see for yourself, just think of yourself.

196
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:13,429
I mean, you are the ones who know such a lot
about life.

197
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:21,740
Even if you get a little bit possessed, doesn’t
matter.

198
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:34,020
But you know that you are possessed.

199
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,650
Now think of it.

200
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,830
This is the second preparation one has to
have – is understanding that it is God Almighty

201
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,950
Himself [who is] worried about you.

202
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,769
He’s sent everybody to help you, “Go ahead!”

203
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:05,929
So you don’t have to worry about your money,
you don’t have to worry about all other

204
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:06,929
things.

205
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:17,309
The third thing comes automatically 
that you don’t have to worry about all these

206
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,480
things at all.

207
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,049
They’ll be looked after.

208
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,830
You all have been looked after, you know that.

209
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,800
Everyone has been helped.

210
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:37,620
But if you know that He is Almighty and He’s
compassion and that you have fallen into His

211
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,570
grace – think of it!

212
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:48,590
Establish yourself at that point.

213
00:19:48,590 --> 00:20:05,769
This is the preparation one has to have, that
He is the one who has given all this.

214
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:17,720
Then, the modern Sahaja Yogis are specially
blessed because they have a ‘walkie-talkie’

215
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,179
with them.

216
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:30,210
Any problem that they have are handled in
form, in person!

217
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:41,669
There was never such a blessing before.

218
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:51,129
But ego is the point.

219
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,370
To begin with it is ego.

220
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,249
You have seen it.

221
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,230
If you have ego you will not accept you are
a Realised-soul.

222
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,230
Imagine, how silly it is!

223
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:06,620
If you have a superego also you will not recognise
it.

224
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,620
You will go back to the same position as you
were.

225
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,860
You will never accept that you are a Realised-soul
if you have a superego.

226
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,860
You’ll never accept, “Oh, how can it be,
Mother?

227
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,179
After all I am an ordinary human being."

228
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,370
You’ll go on like that, “How can I cure
others?

229
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,370
How can I give Realisation?

230
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,370
It is not possible."

231
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,370
You see this kind of a humility, nonsensical.

232
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,370
I mean, it’s alright, I mean it’s like
a ??

233
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,370
saying, “Oh, how can I cure you?”

234
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,370
It’s like that.

235
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,370
It’s like no meaning.

236
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,440
This kind of a humility has no meaning for
you.

237
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,380
“How can I do it, Mother?

238
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,020
What can I do?

239
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,789
Oh, I am no good.

240
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:50,340
I’m of no use."

241
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,679
This language must be given up.

242
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:04,879
When it is ego then it is even worse.

243
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:11,120
You can harm yourself and you can harm Sahaja
Yoga, at the extreme point.

244
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,620
Egoistical people are extremely difficult,
they are such a drag, because they try to

245
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,149
do everything through their intelligence and
understanding and this and that, and such

246
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:30,980
a rambling goes on and on and on, and you
try to pull them back again and they go back.

247
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,809
It’s so boring, you know.

248
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:34,990
Very boring.

249
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,730
Because you know, I see the stuff, supposing,
I know this is it (a cup of tea) and I want

250
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,889
you to have it.

251
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:43,350
And between taking this cup to the lip, [if]
every time you are pulling it out, every time

252
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,710
you are pulling it out, then how am I to take
it to your lip?

253
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,919
It’s very boring!

254
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,179
And this egoistical temperament is very prevalent
in the West, surprisingly.

255
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,929
And I just don’t understand.

256
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:09,640
They can take to all kinds of filth, all kinds
of perversions without arguing about it!

257
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,260
Just take to it!

258
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,200
Any kind of perversion – “What’s wrong?”

259
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:29,070
But it is for them the most wrong thing is
to be accepting the fact that you are a Realised-soul

260
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,880
through Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:45,190
They’ll take anything else but not the truth.

262
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:52,429
This ego is like a horse sitting on your head.

263
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:59,730
You have to sit on the horse, and the horse
is sitting on your head.

264
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:09,669
You are carrying the load of the horse – imagine!
what is the sense in such a thing?

265
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:16,519
If you start analysing yourself, again you
will go into another trip.

266
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,620
You have been such ‘trippers’ like [a]
Jack in the box, you see.

267
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,769
Because you have been taking trips after trips,
there’s a sort of a spring.

268
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:33,499
You try to see your ego, you go on a trip
of superego.

269
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:36,070
You try to see your superego and you go on
a trip of [ego].

270
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:42,020
I mean, a person who has been bouncing all
the time to this trip or that trip or that

271
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,759
trip or that trip is just like a person travelling
all the time, doesn’t know whether he has

272
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,019
to get down or has to go further.

273
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,850
It’s like that!

274
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,220
The habit of the mind is so egoistical that
you just take the ride on the thing.

275
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:06,720
But the thing is [that] it is not that you
take the ride, but the ego takes you on a

276
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,409
ride.

277
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,799
And whenever there is any such a thing coming
up, it grabs you.

278
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,110
And the progress is extremely slow.

279
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:37,570
Now the trouble with the Divine is that it
has its own protocol and if the King has to

280
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,730
come to your house, you have to go and invite
the King.

281
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,880
The King doesn’t write to you that, “Please
invite me to your house,” does he?

282
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,250
That’s why he’s King, after all!

283
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:05,850
And he doesn’t implore people that, “Please
invite me."

284
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,309
This Mr.

285
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:19,441
Ego expects that 
you should be invited by the Divine.

286
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:26,190
That the Divine must go out of the way to
fetch you out.

287
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:47,029
Ego, in simple words, is nothing but absolutely
wrong ideas about one’s own value: by which

288
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:53,580
you think that, “I am everything."

289
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,970
What are you?

290
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:01,590
Now don’t go on a superego trip.

291
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,860
What are we?

292
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,950
Nothing!

293
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,740
We cannot even sprout the seed.

294
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:18,860
Every day-to-day life you can see this clearly:
how ego jumps up.

295
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:35,029
Supposing somebody says that, “British have
these qualities,” one feels very happy.

296
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,230
“Oh, what a praise it is!

297
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,600
What a praise for British!

298
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,370
Oh, we are British!” immediately.

299
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,790
Somebody says that, “British lack these
qualities,” finished!

300
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:55,630
You are absolutely…then that person is the
worst person in the whole world.

301
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:02,919
First of all, you must know that neither you
are British, nor Indian nor anything.

302
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,639
You are just human beings.

303
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:15,509
Ignorance is responsible for this ego.

304
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:25,379
It is complete ignorance about yourself gives
you this ego.

305
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:34,840
So once we are going towards light we must
know what are our hurdles.

306
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,779
[This] is the preparation.

307
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:47,799
Is the ignorance that we have about ourselves
that’s why we are going to see ourselves.

308
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,580
And because of the ignorance, ego and super-go
both have come onto us, so at least we’ll

309
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,049
have nothing to do with them.

310
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:07,820
Supposing you have to go on the Himalayas
where you are going for an expedition.

311
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:15,529
You are supposed to carry the lightest things
that you have.

312
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,950
You don’t carry three luggage of tiffin
carriers, four luggage of this, and five things

313
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,710
of that, to have a nice little bed there and
sleep over.

314
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,730
All that you leave here.

315
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,899
In the same way when you are going on the
expedition of knowing yourself, all that is

316
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:41,139
loading up yourself must be put down.

317
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:48,320
So again we come to ego and superego.

318
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:57,279
Actually, these two are terrible elephants
which must be kept down on the ground.

319
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,340
So we make our own study.

320
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,830
These preparations are needed because we have
already gone on this side too much or that

321
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
side too much.

322
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,720
So the preparation is to bring you down, “Come
along here.

323
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,860
Now you stand in the centre!” or we bring
you down here and stand in the centre.

324
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,720
The preparation is nothing but is just to
bring you down here, that’s all.

325
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:33,740
So with ego we move on and see what the ego
has subtler and subtler and subtler forms.

326
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:42,790
Even in superego you have subtler and subtler
and subtler forms.

327
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:51,299
To understand ego you must see what do you
plan about your life?

328
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,690
It’s very easy.

329
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,490
What are your plans about future life?

330
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,909
To understand your superego you must know
what affects you very much, what makes you

331
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,369
very unhappy.

332
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:13,130
Or you can say, what makes you more happy
and what makes you more unhappy.

333
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:20,710
Both things, happiness and unhappiness, are
the shadows of these two trees.

334
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,830
One is ego, another is superego.

335
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,389
Just watch yourself.

336
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:32,659
What makes you very happy?

337
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,369
Good clothes?

338
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,080
Good living?

339
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,570
Or when your name appears in “Who’s who?”

340
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:45,159
(book) or all such nonsensical things which
make you laugh, you see!

341
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,629
All that.

342
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:49,570
You just see that.

343
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,470
What makes you unhappy?

344
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:59,919
When [there is] some sort of a heartbreak
and this and that.

345
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,580
All this kind of a nonsense.

346
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Both things are not yourself.

347
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
They are just outside.

348
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:11,950
So what is inside, if you have to find out,
first the outside must be taken away.

349
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:20,230
If you have to taste the fruit you take out
the outside, you peel it out.

350
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:27,059
In the same way, this must be peeled out.

351
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,380
Now this you should see within yourself and
without also.

352
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,489
You can see it very clearly without.

353
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,009
It’s very easy.

354
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:46,190
How you deal with others is the point – what
is your relationship with others.

355
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,749
It is easier to know this outside than inside,
perhaps.

356
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:58,460
When you talk to others, what is the impact
they have from you?

357
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:06,540
Are you appreciated by others or not?

358
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,239
Among Sahaja Yogis.

359
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:13,289
Do you respect another Sahaja Yogi as a Sahaja
Yogi or not?

360
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:20,090
Do you expect that whatever stage you are,
the other Sahaja Yogi will also come up and

361
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,739
he must be given the due respect?

362
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:30,980
Also you must see that when any Sahaja Yogi,
who has achieved something or who is at a

363
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,539
better level, tries to pull you up – [do]
you like it or resist it or get upset about

364
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,840
it?

365
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,279
If somebody tells you, “This should be done,
that should be done,” do you take it as

366
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:50,159
if he has abused you?

367
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,919
If he is telling you about Sahaja Yoga you
should be thankful in all normal way.

368
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,750
I feel thankful to you if you tell me something
that concerns Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,750
Anything!

370
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,580
Even if you tell me, “Mother this may not
be alright if You say.

371
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,150
You see, the human beings are like this,”
I accept it and I do it according to your

372
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,460
wishes.

373
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,230
Or do you like it or not?

374
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,820
This is how you will judge your ego.

375
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,780
This is only your Mr.

376
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Ego.

377
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,840
Actually, it is better to have another person
to fight your ego and yourself; both put together.

378
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,480
If somebody tells you that, “This should
be done,” “Oh, I see, I have been doing

379
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
that.

380
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Yes, alright.

381
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,600
You come and help me.

382
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,379
You pull me out.

383
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,870
Work it out.

384
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,430
Try and help me.

385
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,990
I am horrible!”

386
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,040
That’s the way, if you do it, [that] you
can get over this ego.

387
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,630
But the other person should say, “You are
very nice.

388
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,910
Alright, do what you please,” and then you
feel happy.

389
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:04,510
This person is not so alright and you are
also not so alright.

390
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,230
Because you have to pull out people.

391
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:14,661
For example, if you understand that you are
in a crisis, you are in an emergency, people

392
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:19,840
are getting drowned and some people are trying
to pull them out, they themselves are halfway

393
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:26,540
down, halfway up, they are trying to pull
you out, at that time if they say, “Hold

394
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,960
my hand now!”

395
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:38,980
If you feel upset about it then you are not
wise.

396
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,570
Now in Sahaja Yoga there is no leader as such.

397
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,140
I mean, nobody is appointed as leader.

398
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,850
Anybody tries to do that, he goes down.

399
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:57,590
But there is an innate leadership within,
and such a person is extremely humble and

400
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:10,780
congenial and appealing and commanding too,
has to be commanding.

401
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,360
And one should not feel bad at that time,
because if he says, “Go and steal something,”

402
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:23,300
or “You go and join some- one of these nonsensical
things”, then of course he is wrong!

403
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,530
But if he is saying that, “In Sahaja Yoga
you have to come up!”

404
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,550
Even dominatingly (sic) if he says, I mean,
it’s a very good thing, I would say.

405
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:39,790
Supposing somebody is in your neighbourhood
who is always criticising.

406
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,490
In a way it’s a blessing because [if] there’s
somebody who is criticising us he’s trying

407
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,490
to perfect us.

408
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,230
I mean, we should take it.

409
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,470
Not to feel bad about it.

410
00:36:51,470 --> 00:37:01,490
Supposing somebody is saying something about
you, if it is not true, then what is there

411
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,980
to feel bad?

412
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:10,240
If he is telling lies about you, there is
nothing to be frightened about.

413
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,360
If he is telling the truth, then you have
to be thankful.

414
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,810
Though sometimes the truth could be very unpalatable,
could be very, very bad.

415
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,780
But it is a good thing.

416
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:32,080
There is a saying in Marathi, “Keep the
house of the person who is a backbiter, the

417
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,600
one who backbites.

418
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,610
Keep the house of such a man who is your backbiter
next to you.

419
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,910
Next door."

420
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,800
That you know your defects, you see, you correct
yourself.

421
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,150
Is the wise attitude.

422
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:01,090
Because you cannot correct yourself, so have
a mirror by which you correct yourself.

423
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:05,250
I mean, you should thank such a man that he
is criticising you.

424
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,790
By pampering you if he is going to completely
destroy you, what’s the use?

425
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,490
This is what the gurus are doing.

426
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,190
They are all pampering you and destroying
you and ultimately you find out that you have

427
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,390
been befooled.

428
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:29,770
So if you accept the situation in which you
say, “Alright, if this is what is going

429
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:42,090
to be the truth, it’s very much better for
my ego and if it is not the truth then what

430
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,240
is so important?”

431
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:59,370
This attitude helps in Sahaja Yoga very much,
a very wise attitude towards oneself is.

432
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,460
And you will be surprised as you’ll grow
with this attitude, you won’t be easily

433
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,890
hurt by what people say to you.

434
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,060
You won’t bother.

435
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:13,240
You know how much people criticise me and
say all kinds of things, argue with me, and

436
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,190
I’m not bothered because I know they are
foolish.

437
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,190
What is there?

438
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,190
They are stupid people.

439
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,190
What is there?

440
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,940
Even if they praise me, what is it?

441
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,310
After all, whatever they praise me is my nature,
nothing so great.

442
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,770
See, it makes no difference.

443
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,370
I am just watching my chakras working.

444
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,810
I am not bothered.

445
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:37,540
In the same way, it will happen to you and
you will not be bothered.

446
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,540
But this will help your unloading.

447
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,880
This will help your unloading.

448
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:54,310
And, the unhappy part of it: in that we should
prepare ourselves in a way that , “Nothing

449
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,950
can make me unhappy.

450
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,670
What can make me unhappy if I am a Realised-soul?”

451
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:08,720
Supposing you want to marry someone – take
a concrete thing – and you find the person

452
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,750
has sort of misbehaved or you cannot marry.

453
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,020
So what?

454
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,920
“I am there.

455
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,730
My value is myself I know."

456
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:27,010
So your value, your self-esteem should be
such that nothing should make you unhappy.

457
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,770
It’s all a drama going on.

458
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,280
It’s all a drama.

459
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,960
But these things must be accepted by your
great intelligence because what I find here

460
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,310
is the difficulty with the Western mind is
this that – it has too much of IQ, too much

461
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,310
over-developed.

462
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,120
So it is such a polished surface that nothing
stays there, everything.

463
00:40:50,120 --> 00:41:01,700
The first simple thing is that you are a Realised-soul
itself should settled down there somehow,

464
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:09,820
and to your intelligence that you are a Realised-soul
now.

465
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:17,520
All of you believe in the heart, not in the
brain.

466
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,890
That you are a Realised-soul, is first thing
you must tell your intelligence.

467
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:29,670
And then you must tell your intelligence also
that, “Nothing can make me unhappy and nothing

468
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,570
can befool me."

469
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:47,340
If these three points settle down on your
intelligence I will see the rest of it.

470
00:41:47,340 --> 00:42:00,830
You just fix these three points on your intelligence
then you will be amazed [that] you will become

471
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,290
a very loving person, extremely considerate
of others.

472
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,630
It will all work out automatically.

473
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,070
Because when your intelligence is like that
nothing goes in.

474
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,200
You are all the time worried about others.

475
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:25,450
Either you are afraid of others or you are
aggressive on others.

476
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,470
You cannot go straight forward.

477
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,500
This is what happens.

478
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,370
If you could understand these three points
clearly.

479
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,370
(laughing).

480
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,170
Yogini: Nobody does that.

481
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,290
Shri Mataji: She says that “Nobody does
that.

482
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,290
That’s the problem."

483
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,290
Absolutely.

484
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,290
She’s so practical.

485
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,290
(laughing).

486
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,290
She is so practical, you see.

487
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,070
Just now in the car she said, “Everybody
does something other [than they should].

488
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,630
They do not do what is the first to be done."

489
00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:00,390
Like she said, “They’ll marry, you have
to marry and enjoy your wife and your husband

490
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,910
and your children.

491
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,950
They’ll do everything else but that."

492
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,310
(laughing) It is that.

493
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,310
You see, nobody does that.

494
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,310
It’s so practical if you do it.

495
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:19,500
Listening to Mataji is not the thing I want
you to do, but doing of it is.

496
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:26,170
Sit down and tell your intelligence, your
IQ, that, “Mr IQ, now please listen.

497
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:32,260
This is what has happened to me, and this
is what I am.

498
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,660
I am a Realised-soul and nothing should pamper
me and nothing should make me unhappy."

499
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,230
That’s all.

500
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,010
“Nobody can hurt me."

501
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:50,860
Otherwise you are, “Aaahahhahaa, aahhaahah,”
like that, it goes in two ways.

502
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,500
Never in a straight way.

503
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:01,230
Where you are just compassion and you are
love.

504
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,640
Absolutely relying upon yourself, absolutely.

505
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,240
And then you have me with you.

506
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,030
And you think of those sages who had nobody
to guide, nobody to tell, nobody to talk to.

507
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,420
All your granthis and all that, I am breaking.

508
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,820
You don’t have to do anything.

509
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:23,900
But only thing you don’t create your own
granthis, your own knots.

510
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,810
If you do not create, things will work out.

511
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,630
This is a very simple preparation.

512
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,620
So I don’t have to tell you, “Love your
brothers and sisters,” and this and that.

513
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,840
That’s going the other way around.

514
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,170
But you just tell your intelligence.

515
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:46,350
This is enlightenment of the intelligence.

516
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,440
If that intelligence comes into you then it
is wisdom.

517
00:44:51,440 --> 00:45:00,820
“That anybody is laughing at me or everybody’s
making fun of me or anybody is trying to dominate

518
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,070
me,” all these fears or all these aggressiveness,
all this will disappear just like that.

519
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:18,280
That now you are a flower and you are fragrant
and the fragrance is blowing, and many bees

520
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,030
are going to come to you, that’s what you
are!

521
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,060
This is the beginning.

522
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,680
Go on telling yourself like that.

523
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:37,380
If you could do that, if you can bring your
intelligence to this level, not too high,

524
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:44,970
not too low, but in the centre, everything
can be solved in no time.

525
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:51,110
When I am now living with you people, going
through your Kundalinis, all that, I have

526
00:45:51,110 --> 00:46:00,290
found out at this point only: that you just
don’t tell your intelligence this.

527
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:06,970
So that you start giving up all kinds of fanaticism,
all fears and this, and superstitions and

528
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,220
all nonsense.

529
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,240
Because nothing can harm you.

530
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,910
No stars can harm you, not your science can
harm you, what time you were born.

531
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,530
Nothing can harm you now!

532
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,660
You are beyond it.

533
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:26,430
So astrology is finished.

534
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,010
Horoscopes are finished.

535
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:32,980
All other…what other things you had like
this?

536
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,840
Sahaja Yogi: Karma.

537
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,300
Shri Mataji: Karmas are finished.

538
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,760
Sahaja Yogini: Palmistry

539
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,530
Shri Mataji: Palmistry is finished.

540
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,530
Sahaja Yogi: Biorhythm.

541
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,530
(Big laughter]

542
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,530
Shri Mataji: Biorhythm’s finished!

543
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,530
Biorhythm’s finished!

544
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,530
All that.

545
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,530
I mean, you are beyond that.

546
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,660
Now all these things, all such things.

547
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,430
Then the other side of it.

548
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,660
All love affairs finished.

549
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,990
All fear of love affairs finished.

550
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,660
Everything finished, nonsense.

551
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,830
It’s only love.

552
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:14,030
Now whosoever you will get, you will love
that person, that person will love you.

553
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,190
If he doesn’t care or loves you, it doesn’t
matter.

554
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:19,400
As long as you love, finished!

555
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,020
All expectations finished, all expectations
finished.

556
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,740
All expectations for happiness.

557
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,390
Joy is single and absolute.

558
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,010
When you are in joy you are at a state when
there is no movement.

559
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:44,100
You are just there.

560
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:49,750
So get rid of this both feelings of, “I
am very happy now!”

561
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,920
“I am now in joy.

562
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,920
I am established in joy and that’s what
I have to grow within me not that my old stuffs.

563
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,570
That’s dead, finished."

564
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:11,580
When the trees drop out their leaves, people
don’t expect them to again rise and get

565
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,560
attached to the trees?

566
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
(Laughter).

567
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,930
In the same way whatever is gone and finished
is finished now.

568
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:26,190
Now let us grow what is new coming in us,
and this is to be nurtured now – is the

569
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:38,480
joy, is that dignified majestic, that beauty
within ourselves.

570
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,710
Then you don’t get upset.

571
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,770
Not bothered what others have to say about
you.

572
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,090
It will happen.

573
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:55,030
It will happen if you put it down on your
intelligence.

574
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:00,590
And people will see that in you because you
don’t do anything funny, you don’t do

575
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,600
anything wrong.

576
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,120
People like you.

577
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:11,740
Even those who are not Realised will see that
dignity in you, that you are so dignified

578
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,490
because you have your own understanding of
yourself.

579
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:23,130
It’s a very simple thing, but as she has
said it, nobody does it.

580
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,680
Tell your intelligence.

581
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:36,840
Even now I find that some people do have that
joy within them trickling in.

582
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,710
But you have to prosper into that.

583
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,690
You have to come into that.

584
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,000
Dropping out all that is nonsensical.

585
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,330
Otherwise you will go off like that.

586
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:58,060
And it takes hardly any time or hardly anything.

587
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:04,450
Whatever is done wrong, is done wrong, finished!

588
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:09,200
Just to be finished off because it’s dead
now, so why bother about it?

589
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:16,920
Just to finish off.

590
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:25,100
Because if I tell you something with a harsh
tone it will not stick on there.

591
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:35,410
If I do it delicately also it will not work
out, because, what I told you, there’s a

592
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,410
polish.

593
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:42,430
Take out the polish, and what is the polish?

594
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:58,790
The polish is the all understanding of norms,
the all understanding of norms of life.

595
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:04,940
Because you thought [that] if you were in
this condition you would be happy, that’s

596
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,680
why you are doing it.

597
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:20,870
Because you thought, if you do like this,
there is a fear this, the left-side problem.

598
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:31,100
But if this all understanding of the mind,
if you clear it out with your light, with

599
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:40,470
your own wisdom, then you’ll be amazed [that]
this thing will stick into you, completely.

600
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,810
This wisdom will stick into you.

601
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,040
Forget that old nonsense.

602
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,970
So many things you have already sorted out
yourself, you know, so many things which were

603
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,620
nonsensical before.

604
00:51:53,620 --> 00:52:04,310
But the identification of all these ideas
should be achieved, should be achieved, is

605
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,780
the point.

606
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,780
You know that this is all nonsensical.

607
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,900
But is to be achieved.

608
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,620
That’s the preparation.

609
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,620
You have the light, you have the movement
now.

610
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,970
you are moving into it, but the light is not
here.

611
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,600
[It] dangles, sometimes falls like this, falls
like that.

612
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:39,220
If you can fix your light properly, just by
this understanding that whatever were the

613
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:52,640
norms before were due to ignorance and we
have to have our norms of our own now [regarding]

614
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,770
what is a Sahaja Yogi.

615
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:09,060
And these norms, I am going to tell you how
these norms are going to come to you like

616
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:15,040
faith, like entire dependence on spirituality,
entire dependence on your vibrations.

617
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,670
All these norms of the new life, we have to
accept.

618
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,610
But to be achieved, I mean to say to be achieved,
you see.

619
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,580
Not just to be understood in a lecture.

620
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:35,050
So I’ll tell you about that in the evening,
and tomorrow I will tell you [about] the real

621
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,050
becoming, alright?

622
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,050
Thank you.

623
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,050
May God bless you.

624
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,050
Shri Mataji: Just go on saying, now are you
opening?

625
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,050
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible]

626
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,180
Shri Mataji: You do not want to assume your
position, that’s the problem.

627
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Better?

628
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:50,030
This is what I am saying, you see.

629
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,980
It’s moving out.

630
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:58,880
Just say that, “Nothing can happen.

631
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,800
No bhoot can catch me.

632
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,710
I can catch the bhoots."

633
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,660
That’s the truth.

634
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,580
Douglas Fry: Lunch is served.

635
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,530
Shri Mataji: Hah?

636
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:38,900
Sahaja Yogini: Do you want to take your lunch
in here?

637
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,110
Shri Mataji: Or else?

638
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,490
Sahaja Yogini: In the dining room.

639
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,800
It’s very nice..

640
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,440
Shri Mataji: Nice or not, I will have it with
you people.
