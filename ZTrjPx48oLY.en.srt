1
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:31,304
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:36,357
I think we have not understood

3
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,005
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:51,848
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:28,734
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:44,600
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:59,294
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,667
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:14,100
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:29,587
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:35,599
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:38,355
to cool him down.

13
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:53,704
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:57,198
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:02,224
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:18,696
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,877
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,642
then somehow or other,

19
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,892
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:34,169
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:40,569
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,206
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,001
or who become left-sided,

24
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:16,127
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:22,487
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:26,606
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:46,970
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:54,989
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,874
who is very left-sided,

30
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:04,787
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,223
unhappy and worried,

32
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,428
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,456
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,893
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,546
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:38,774
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,506
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,529
is something superior.

39
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:03,993
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:16,709
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,856
all the time thinks,

42
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,613
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,863
I'm so depressed," this, that,

44
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:27,167
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:32,620
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,692
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:59,275
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,148
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,374
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:17,940
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,355
So, we went to have our food

52
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:33,461
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:45,285
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,387
Then they said that

55
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:55,675
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,800
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

57
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,921
So this lady started saying,

58
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:16,204
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,596
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,499
I said, "This is all fun;

61
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,088
this is not something a problem."

62
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:37,817
This 'problema' word should be given up.

63
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,287
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:53,796
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:56,220
in our young age.

66
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:10,237
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:13,186
to find everything negative

68
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:19,667
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,314
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:37,041
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

71
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,477
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,047
everything was fine.

73
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:53,471
I said, "See now, you were only counting

74
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:57,863
how many negative things there are,

75
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,101
and you were not seeing the fun."

76
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:16,521
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,809
"You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:26,396
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,283
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:32,488
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

81
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,317
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,607
always light in His hand.

83
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:54,256
And He runs up and down

84
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,546
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:13,404
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:21,334
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:24,811
"This is mine",

88
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:38,177
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

89
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,453
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,792
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:55,187
that your children also become negative.

92
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:08,925
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:17,702
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

94
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:23,637
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:27,972
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,943
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:51,369
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:13:56,313 --> 00:14:00,884
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,116
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:10,041
Nothing can please them.

101
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:17,504
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:21,229
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:35,080
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:41,233
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:44,591
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,907
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:14:54,807 --> 00:15:01,251
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,688
if you hide, run away,

109
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:08,075
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,564
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:23,129
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,518
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:38,614
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:53,200
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:15:57,952 --> 00:16:02,084
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:10,938
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:19,161
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,460
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,466
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:29,691
When will this end?"

121
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,635
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:46,884
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:58,322
Then the third one says,

124
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:02,756
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:12,259
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:22,869
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:32,025
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:36,115
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:39,468
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:45,311
and they become very,

131
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,885
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,851
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,981
in negativity.

134
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:12,102
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:20,663
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,593
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:34,235
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,103
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,628
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:43,012
so I started talking to her.

141
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,704
And she started talking very wisely,

142
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,243
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:58,722
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,589
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:04,846
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:15,977
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,594
and no one loves her.

148
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:29,588
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

149
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:37,116
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:41,127
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:44,473
I said, "What's this?"

152
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,911
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,620
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,954
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:09,097
and why are You talking to her?"

156
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,621
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,505
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

158
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,723
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:29,452
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,949
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,999
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,677
you see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,513
this is this and this is that,"

164
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:51,321
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:56,612
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,858
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,798
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,955
So, one has to know that

169
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:26,302
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,321
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:40,621
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,081
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:56,360
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:03,132
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:06,342
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:10,242
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:15,770
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:25,160
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,429
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:33,613
and goes to the right side.

181
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:44,525
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:51,378
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:04,105
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

184
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:08,166
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,444
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:18,170
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:26,134
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:29,001
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:34,546
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,378
I mean, the police takes them,

191
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:51,870
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:23:57,193 --> 00:24:02,259
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:12,111
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:15,772
sly things like thieving.

195
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,307
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:30,700
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:42,110
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:50,658
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:58,579
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:01,181
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:05,914
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:17,381
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:23,273
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:30,319
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,241
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:40,529
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,236
that I should go to hell,then He says,

208
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:46,285
'All right, you can go.'

209
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:58,996
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

210
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:08,897
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:15,961
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,282
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:37,706
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:54,188
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:26:57,221 --> 00:27:04,351
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,479
May God bless you all.
