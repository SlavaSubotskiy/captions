1
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:59,360
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

2
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,248
but it never happened before.

3
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:09,409
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

4
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,581
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

5
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:16,485
some good luck has to come.

6
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:28,596
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

7
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:35,932
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

8
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:42,659
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

9
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,706
Because He came to teach us humility.

10
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:56,781
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

11
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:08,565
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

12
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:15,554
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

13
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:23,679
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

14
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:32,422
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

15
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:39,022
He had to talk of humility that time,

16
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:44,644
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

17
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:53,860
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

18
00:35:54,082 --> 00:36:01,915
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

19
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:07,243
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

20
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:15,315
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

21
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:18,718
In the same way Romans were.

22
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:25,717
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

23
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,882
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

24
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,636
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

25
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:41,280
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

26
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:48,879
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

27
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:54,593
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

28
00:36:54,793 --> 00:37:02,569
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

29
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:09,134
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

30
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:14,188
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

31
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:17,822
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

32
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:23,564
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

33
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:31,351
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

34
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,832
everybody in the office is like that.

35
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:39,358
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

36
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,362
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

37
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:50,515
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

38
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:55,144
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

39
00:37:55,344 --> 00:38:00,915
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

40
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:06,437
The another humbler group was
affected because

41
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:10,208
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

42
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:14,507
So they became equally violent

43
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:19,681
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

44
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:25,819
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

45
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:32,911
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

46
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:38,250
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

47
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,242
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

48
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,865
if you develop a barking temperament

49
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:48,394
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

50
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:54,977
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

51
00:38:55,178 --> 00:39:00,617
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

52
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:06,872
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

53
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:10,020
and jump at every person who comes
along

54
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,036
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

55
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:23,802
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

56
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:29,474
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

57
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:33,377
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

58
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,415
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

59
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:42,802
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

60
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:50,403
In those circumstances Christ was born.

61
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:54,257
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

62
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,233
but He was born for the whole world.

63
00:39:57,433 --> 00:40:02,765
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

64
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:08,270
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

65
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:14,602
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

66
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:21,272
So they had to be controlled first of all,

67
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:25,170
and Christ had to come at a time where

68
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:31,001
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

69
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:36,926
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

70
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:43,880
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

71
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:51,231
He came to create peace on earth.

72
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,877
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

73
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:02,848
secondly when you are Realized.

74
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,499
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

75
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,880
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

76
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:20,729
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

77
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:25,462
runs away from situations,
escapist,

78
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:30,837
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

79
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:38,552
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

80
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,430
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

81
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:47,019
and the humblest man you could
think of.

82
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,294
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

83
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:57,930
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

84
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:04,638
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

85
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,950
This is the balance.

86
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:15,929
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

87
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,929
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

88
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,991
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

89
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:30,219
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

90
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,411
Human beings are violent to each other.

91
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:40,687
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

92
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:48,144
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

93
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:54,474
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

94
00:42:56,178 --> 00:43:02,560
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

95
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:09,123
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

96
00:43:09,324 --> 00:43:13,442
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

97
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:18,669
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

98
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:25,138
The birth is very, very symbolic.

99
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:35,163
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

100
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:40,607
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

101
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:45,241
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

102
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:52,270
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

103
00:43:57,388 --> 00:44:01,122
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

104
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:09,796
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

105
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:14,649
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

106
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:24,005
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

107
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:28,646
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

108
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:39,318
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

109
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:59,052
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

110
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:08,567
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

111
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:13,194
because people were so proud
of their money,

112
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:17,843
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

113
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:22,489
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

114
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:27,004
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

115
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:35,286
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

116
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:41,609
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

117
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,614
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

118
00:45:48,597 --> 00:45:55,161
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

119
00:45:56,958 --> 00:46:01,335
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

120
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:06,973
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

121
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:12,574
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

122
00:46:12,894 --> 00:46:17,160
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

123
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,732
Those who have money and think
of money

124
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:34,316
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

125
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:37,941
They are going out already.

126
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:42,623
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

127
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:48,847
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

128
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:57,659
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

129
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:03,209
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

130
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:07,611
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

131
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:12,358
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

132
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:16,737
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

133
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,754
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

134
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,626
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

135
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:25,859
which are never open.

136
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:34,066
This kind of a ego is again revived

137
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:45,417
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

138
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:52,253
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

139
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,391
They gave them money,

140
00:47:54,591 --> 00:48:00,894
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

141
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:08,085
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

142
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:11,975
He was born in a manger.

143
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:23,277
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

144
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:26,079
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

145
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:34,261
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

146
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:37,965
No place.

147
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:46,099
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

148
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:53,363
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

149
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,935
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

150
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,800
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

151
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,863
The humblest of all, a crib,

152
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:15,626
the Highest is put in the manger.

153
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:22,699
So, what do we do?

154
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,599
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

155
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:32,130
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

156
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:35,854
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

157
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:39,988
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

158
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:43,785
I met one man one day,

159
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:48,988
he was all drunk lying near a church.

160
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,398
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

161
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:58,371
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

162
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:03,243
This kind of ridiculous caricature

163
00:50:03,444 --> 00:50:09,594
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

164
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:19,800
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

165
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:25,775
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

166
00:50:25,976 --> 00:50:30,058
Everybody will have their own concept.

167
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:38,153
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

168
00:50:38,354 --> 00:50:44,035
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

169
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:54,029
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

170
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:00,847
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

171
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:08,996
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

172
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:13,287
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

173
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:18,884
 This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

174
00:51:19,085 --> 00:51:25,972
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

175
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:32,153
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

176
00:51:32,354 --> 00:51:35,109
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

177
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:39,560
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

178
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:46,226
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

179
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,944
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

180
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:56,792
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

181
00:51:59,305 --> 00:52:01,800
Aren’t we?

182
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:07,855
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

183
00:52:08,076 --> 00:52:15,558
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

184
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:22,113
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

185
00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:26,066
because He was born in a manger.

186
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:30,550
No comfort was provided for Him.

187
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:38,891
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

188
00:52:39,091 --> 00:52:43,302
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

189
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:48,012
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

190
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:53,981
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

191
00:52:54,182 --> 00:52:56,519
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

192
00:52:56,726 --> 00:53:02,146
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

193
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:13,644
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

194
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:23,175
Humility and adjustment.

195
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:29,970
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

196
00:53:30,171 --> 00:53:35,998
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

197
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,435
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

198
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:45,464
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

199
00:53:46,606 --> 00:53:50,352
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

200
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:54,456
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

201
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:59,787
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

202
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:05,265
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

203
00:54:09,178 --> 00:54:12,601
So the peace has to come.

204
00:54:16,406 --> 00:54:21,368
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

205
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:26,054
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

206
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:33,172
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

207
00:54:37,615 --> 00:54:40,924
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

208
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:44,185
of this body we torture everybody else.

209
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:47,672
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

210
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,359
not in India.

211
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:53,178
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

212
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:58,483
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

213
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:01,455
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

214
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:04,679
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

215
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,836
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

216
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,608
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

217
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:14,844
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

218
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:18,812
I mean, any country like that.

219
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:30,819
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

220
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:37,141
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

221
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:41,563
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

222
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:46,621
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

223
00:55:46,822 --> 00:55:49,503
Do you see that point?

224
00:55:49,703 --> 00:55:53,064
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

225
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:56,191
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

226
00:55:56,391 --> 00:56:00,588
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

227
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:04,767
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

228
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:09,758
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

229
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:21,051
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

230
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:26,414
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

231
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,551
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

232
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,416
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

233
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:44,327
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

234
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,096
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

235
00:56:47,296 --> 00:56:49,804
because He was also lashed that way.

236
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:54,705
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

237
00:56:54,906 --> 00:57:00,679
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

238
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:04,587
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

239
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,744
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

240
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:13,805
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

241
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:22,390
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

242
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:31,659
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

243
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:37,486
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

244
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:43,992
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

245
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:51,484
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

246
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:57,812
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

247
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,405
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

248
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:04,461
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

249
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:12,054
Some of them should. But they don’t.

250
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:15,287
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

251
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:19,867
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

252
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:28,828
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

253
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:35,586
But this is a short time which must
be used.

254
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:39,992
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

255
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:44,427
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

256
00:58:44,627 --> 00:58:47,833
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

257
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:59,172
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

258
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:05,578
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

259
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:10,186
What did this world offer Him at that time?

260
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:16,408
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

261
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:23,732
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

262
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:33,211
This is one thing one has to know.

263
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:40,221
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

264
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:44,326
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

265
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:48,859
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

266
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:55,928
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

267
00:59:56,129 --> 01:00:01,484
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

268
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:10,086
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

269
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,711
to give comfort to Christ.

270
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:22,617
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

271
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:29,031
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

272
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:36,913
You are the kushas, is the thistle.

273
01:00:37,788 --> 01:00:41,725
And for a yogi the kushasana is the one
who sits on the kusha only.

274
01:00:41,949 --> 01:00:44,527
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

275
01:00:44,727 --> 01:00:52,629
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

276
01:00:53,453 --> 01:00:57,014
The Mother is preparing the manger

277
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:05,879
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted, the thistles.

278
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:16,455
Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

279
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:24,812
all must be curbed down.

280
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:31,024
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

281
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:35,890
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

282
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:41,029
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

283
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:44,742
but I know because I’ve done it.

284
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:50,665
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

285
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:54,000
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

286
01:01:54,319 --> 01:02:00,184
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

287
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:05,578
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

288
01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:09,234
that My stomach is screwing up.

289
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:14,502
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

290
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:18,133
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

291
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:22,068
But what about Christ within us?

292
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:28,559
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

293
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:32,164
with your being, with your Spirit,

294
01:02:32,364 --> 01:02:39,112
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

295
01:02:43,535 --> 01:02:47,688
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

296
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:52,385
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

297
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:55,925
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

298
01:02:56,125 --> 01:03:00,096
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

299
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:03,693
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

300
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:06,791
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

301
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:10,129
what is all this going on?

302
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:15,140
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

303
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:23,179
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

304
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:32,126
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

305
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:37,773
If you become humble, peace will come.

306
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:42,937
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

307
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:51,023
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

308
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:56,273
When others are before you,

309
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:04,231
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

310
01:04:04,432 --> 01:04:08,994
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

311
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:14,088
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

312
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:20,343
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

313
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:28,070
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

314
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,617
You don’t know,

315
01:04:34,555 --> 01:04:38,976
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

316
01:04:39,827 --> 01:04:44,429
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

317
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,607
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

318
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:56,039
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

319
01:04:58,323 --> 01:05:02,328
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

320
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:08,015
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

321
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:13,672
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

322
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:16,791
 We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

323
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:22,907
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

324
01:05:23,108 --> 01:05:29,498
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

325
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:33,353
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

326
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,776
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

327
01:05:35,976 --> 01:05:40,159
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

328
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:43,828
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

329
01:05:44,028 --> 01:05:50,920
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

330
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:54,625
My presence in England

331
01:05:57,167 --> 01:06:00,500
is good up to a point,

332
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:06,539
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

333
01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:11,465
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

334
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:15,410
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

335
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,863
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

336
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:24,744
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

337
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:32,601
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

338
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:40,280
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

339
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:44,970
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

340
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:47,518
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

341
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:51,672
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

342
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:56,875
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

343
01:06:57,075 --> 01:07:01,789
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

344
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:08,149
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

345
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:11,709
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

346
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:15,542
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

347
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:21,156
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

348
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:25,250
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

349
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:28,097
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

350
01:07:28,297 --> 01:07:32,398
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

351
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:43,131
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

352
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:50,351
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

353
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,588
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

354
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:57,671
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

355
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:00,608
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

356
01:08:00,808 --> 01:08:06,495
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

357
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,398
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

358
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:13,417
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

359
01:08:13,617 --> 01:08:16,553
we have to respect each other as saints.

360
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:20,956
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

361
01:08:21,157 --> 01:08:24,867
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

362
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:30,116
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

363
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:36,091
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

364
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:42,094
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

365
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:52,211
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

366
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:59,115
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

367
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:01,337
Christ has gone to this extent to say

368
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:06,248
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

369
01:09:06,448 --> 01:09:10,258
With Romans there was no other way out.

370
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:19,724
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

371
01:09:19,924 --> 01:09:23,836
throughout He preached humility.

372
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,549
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

373
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,187
You need not be humble to others, because

374
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:33,183
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

375
01:09:33,384 --> 01:09:36,484
but you be humble to each other.

376
01:09:39,648 --> 01:09:44,836
Humble in your demands of life.

377
01:09:45,066 --> 01:09:48,136
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

378
01:09:48,337 --> 01:09:52,118
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

379
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:57,771
of a strange characters, you see,

380
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:03,575
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

381
01:10:03,776 --> 01:10:11,429
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

382
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:15,744
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

383
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:19,393
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

384
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:24,281
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

385
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:28,070
adjust yourself.

386
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:30,212
If somebody has one room you should say,

387
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:34,203
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

388
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:37,380
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

389
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:41,575
to the room which has the attached bath.

390
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:44,537
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

391
01:10:44,737 --> 01:10:49,531
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

392
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:57,703
Better give up. Better give up.

393
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,451
See now? Better give up.

394
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:06,477
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

395
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:09,929
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

396
01:11:10,129 --> 01:11:13,578
but need not ask for attached bath.

397
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:22,727
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

398
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:27,773
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

399
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,777
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

400
01:11:35,977 --> 01:11:40,599
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

401
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,385
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

402
01:11:46,586 --> 01:11:53,109
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

403
01:11:53,454 --> 01:11:59,387
Christ was given the crib of a manger

404
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:04,512
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

405
01:12:04,712 --> 01:12:11,096
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

406
01:12:11,296 --> 01:12:17,919
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

407
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:24,649
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

408
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:27,338
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

409
01:12:27,538 --> 01:12:31,640
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

410
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:38,969
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

411
01:12:41,129 --> 01:12:47,540
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

412
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:52,312
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

413
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:57,677
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

414
01:12:57,877 --> 01:13:01,234
Here you must have gloves.

415
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:06,473
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

416
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:10,291
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

417
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:14,062
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

418
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:23,672
But He was a very clean person.

419
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:35,398
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

420
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:39,116
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

421
01:13:39,316 --> 01:13:44,523
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

422
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:47,898
and sometimes with one.

423
01:13:49,281 --> 01:13:55,179
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

424
01:13:59,441 --> 01:14:03,578
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

425
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:07,565
that we are the saviours today,

426
01:14:07,766 --> 01:14:14,925
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

427
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:20,588
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

428
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:23,248
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

429
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:26,337
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

430
01:14:26,538 --> 01:14:31,422
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

431
01:14:31,623 --> 01:14:38,459
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

432
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:45,633
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

433
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:50,159
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

434
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:52,795
If you are the emperor of this world,

435
01:14:52,995 --> 01:14:55,235
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

436
01:14:55,436 --> 01:15:00,043
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

437
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:06,389
What material thing can charm such
a person?

438
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:11,305
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

439
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:17,413
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

440
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:22,791
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

441
01:15:22,992 --> 01:15:28,372
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

442
01:15:28,572 --> 01:15:35,297
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

443
01:15:37,693 --> 01:15:44,711
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

444
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:49,605
Beauty is the comfort,

445
01:15:49,805 --> 01:15:53,466
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

446
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:58,304
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

447
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:01,890
how comforting is the beauty.

448
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:09,274
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

449
01:16:09,474 --> 01:16:19,426
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

450
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:23,523
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

451
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:28,047
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

452
01:16:28,248 --> 01:16:31,226
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

453
01:16:31,427 --> 01:16:35,257
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

454
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:43,015
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

455
01:16:43,962 --> 01:16:49,922
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

456
01:16:50,123 --> 01:16:52,638
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

457
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:58,394
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

458
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:01,867
And once you ask for that,

459
01:17:03,354 --> 01:17:08,224
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

460
01:17:08,425 --> 01:17:14,994
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

461
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:19,749
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

462
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:23,795
is to rejoice in our

463
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:35,544
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

464
01:17:35,745 --> 01:17:39,859
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

465
01:17:40,059 --> 01:17:43,294
you do not hanker, do you?

466
01:17:43,887 --> 01:17:48,417
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

467
01:17:48,617 --> 01:17:58,872
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

468
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:02,476
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

469
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:06,084
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

470
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:12,875
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

471
01:18:14,591 --> 01:18:20,488
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

472
01:18:20,688 --> 01:18:24,359
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

473
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,888
“Mother, he has bitten me.

474
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:35,622
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

475
01:18:37,715 --> 01:18:42,130
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

476
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:48,480
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

477
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:54,800
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

478
01:18:57,563 --> 01:19:04,075
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

479
01:19:04,276 --> 01:19:10,036
The shepherds, simple people,

480
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:17,044
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

481
01:19:17,245 --> 01:19:21,788
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

482
01:19:22,036 --> 01:19:25,583
who are leading a humble life,

483
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:32,302
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

484
01:19:33,938 --> 01:19:36,821
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

485
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:39,673
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

486
01:19:39,873 --> 01:19:43,687
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

487
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:48,281
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

488
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:53,708
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

489
01:19:54,114 --> 01:20:01,345
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

490
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:08,513
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

491
01:20:12,448 --> 01:20:15,958
And another are the wise.

492
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:23,919
Only the wise can understand the star.

493
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:31,021
So many must have seen the star.

494
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:35,049
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

495
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:39,294
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

496
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:43,113
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

497
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:49,997
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

498
01:20:55,051 --> 01:21:00,044
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

499
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:09,029
East is left side and West is right side.

500
01:21:09,646 --> 01:21:18,607
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

501
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:22,781
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

502
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:29,156
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

503
01:21:29,357 --> 01:21:32,485
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

504
01:21:32,685 --> 01:21:37,960
But those who know and are left-sided,

505
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:48,668
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

506
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:52,902
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

507
01:21:53,102 --> 01:22:00,282
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

508
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:04,830
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

509
01:22:05,031 --> 01:22:10,185
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

510
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:12,880
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

511
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:23,174
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

512
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:28,092
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

513
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:35,672
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

514
01:22:35,839 --> 01:22:38,168
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

515
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:40,568
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

516
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:46,122
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

517
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:52,529
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

518
01:22:52,737 --> 01:22:59,226
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

519
01:22:59,427 --> 01:23:02,187
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

520
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:09,386
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

521
01:23:09,587 --> 01:23:12,960
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

522
01:23:13,161 --> 01:23:17,396
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

523
01:23:17,597 --> 01:23:21,570
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

524
01:23:21,771 --> 01:23:24,547
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

525
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:28,915
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

526
01:23:29,115 --> 01:23:33,396
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

527
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:41,763
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

528
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:48,864
See the vibrations.

529
01:23:58,422 --> 01:24:02,325
Because They only can recognize,

530
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:12,146
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

531
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:18,802
So They came.

532
01:24:19,168 --> 01:24:24,036
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

533
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:31,005
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

534
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:35,033
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

535
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:38,349
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

536
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:44,832
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

537
01:24:45,032 --> 01:24:48,593
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

538
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:56,808
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

539
01:24:57,008 --> 01:25:05,763
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

540
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:11,933
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

541
01:25:12,134 --> 01:25:16,544
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

542
01:25:16,934 --> 01:25:20,311
Is a center of gravity,

543
01:25:20,511 --> 01:25:23,870
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

544
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:31,216
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

545
01:25:39,737 --> 01:25:42,458
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

546
01:25:42,658 --> 01:25:49,851
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

547
01:25:50,052 --> 01:25:55,771
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

548
01:25:56,996 --> 01:26:02,154
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

549
01:26:02,355 --> 01:26:07,305
and understanding of Your Being.

550
01:26:09,922 --> 01:26:13,052
No problems.

551
01:26:15,117 --> 01:26:19,311
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

552
01:26:19,512 --> 01:26:23,896
after the same pattern as I made Christ.

553
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:29,232
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

554
01:26:29,844 --> 01:26:35,615
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

555
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:42,289
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

556
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,592
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

557
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:49,812
He would never be upset, no question!

558
01:26:50,012 --> 01:26:51,450
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

559
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:58,802
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

560
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:08,474
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

561
01:27:10,945 --> 01:27:14,547
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

562
01:27:14,748 --> 01:27:17,979
problems and upset.

563
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:26,323
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

564
01:27:26,524 --> 01:27:30,513
No problems, only solutions.

565
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:37,724
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

566
01:27:37,924 --> 01:27:43,701
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

567
01:27:43,901 --> 01:27:49,755
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

568
01:27:53,211 --> 01:28:02,325
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

569
01:28:02,526 --> 01:28:07,716
is the greatest mantra that I use.

570
01:28:08,524 --> 01:28:13,190
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

571
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:20,811
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

572
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:27,029
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

573
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:30,164
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

574
01:28:30,364 --> 01:28:34,703
behold it, accept it, understand.

575
01:28:34,903 --> 01:28:38,605
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

576
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:41,919
that should exist between us.

577
01:28:42,636 --> 01:28:48,247
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

578
01:28:51,022 --> 01:28:53,820
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

579
01:28:54,021 --> 01:29:00,289
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

580
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:04,206
must be given up for a change.

581
01:29:04,406 --> 01:29:12,212
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

582
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,929
All these things must be given up.

583
01:29:15,129 --> 01:29:18,929
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

584
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:23,482
He never had a holiday, never.

585
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,052
This is holidaying.

586
01:29:33,522 --> 01:29:37,265
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

587
01:29:37,465 --> 01:29:41,574
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

588
01:29:41,775 --> 01:29:46,929
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

589
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:50,979
So they must have brought it down,

590
01:29:51,179 --> 01:30:00,226
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

591
01:30:00,426 --> 01:30:07,853
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

592
01:30:08,053 --> 01:30:10,754
and jumping into ditches directly.

593
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:15,378
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

594
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:24,761
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

595
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:31,734
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

596
01:30:31,934 --> 01:30:36,634
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

597
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:39,571
Ask Him for wisdom.

598
01:30:39,772 --> 01:30:45,013
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

599
01:30:46,533 --> 01:30:50,998
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

600
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,710
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

601
01:30:53,911 --> 01:30:59,249
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

602
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:07,813
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

603
01:31:09,508 --> 01:31:14,920
That awe, that respect, that humility,

604
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:20,671
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

605
01:31:20,872 --> 01:31:25,536
Is so close, but complete understanding.

606
01:31:29,075 --> 01:31:34,626
That oneness has to be developed.

607
01:31:34,826 --> 01:31:38,366
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

608
01:31:38,566 --> 01:31:42,151
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

609
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:45,302
in the right direction.

610
01:31:46,482 --> 01:31:52,763
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

611
01:31:52,964 --> 01:31:54,546
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

612
01:31:54,747 --> 01:32:02,763
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

613
01:32:03,979 --> 01:32:06,958
is been blessed,

614
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,815
think of all the nice things we have
done together

615
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:18,734
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

616
01:32:18,935 --> 01:32:22,467
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

617
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:28,911
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

618
01:32:29,145 --> 01:32:33,292
So Christ who is the present Christ,

619
01:32:34,177 --> 01:32:40,817
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

620
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:46,672
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

621
01:32:46,873 --> 01:32:51,396
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

622
01:32:54,550 --> 01:33:00,309
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

623
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:05,053
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

624
01:33:05,253 --> 01:33:13,482
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

625
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:18,023
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

626
01:33:18,224 --> 01:33:23,666
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

627
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:29,083
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

628
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:33,224
He’s a collective being.

629
01:33:33,424 --> 01:33:41,771
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

630
01:33:46,331 --> 01:33:51,281
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

631
01:33:51,482 --> 01:33:56,661
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

632
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:02,171
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

633
01:34:02,372 --> 01:34:06,610
to understand to give up all the strives,

634
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:13,388
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

635
01:34:14,165 --> 01:34:19,505
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

636
01:34:19,706 --> 01:34:25,202
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

637
01:34:25,402 --> 01:34:30,107
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

638
01:34:30,872 --> 01:34:35,854
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

639
01:34:36,054 --> 01:34:39,980
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

640
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:49,318
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

641
01:34:51,272 --> 01:34:59,835
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

642
01:35:00,036 --> 01:35:09,763
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

643
01:35:13,883 --> 01:35:19,024
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

644
01:35:19,224 --> 01:35:22,828
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

645
01:35:23,028 --> 01:35:28,498
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

646
01:35:28,698 --> 01:35:32,843
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

647
01:35:33,044 --> 01:35:38,513
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

648
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:43,419
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

649
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,944
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

650
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:56,729
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

651
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,927
May God bless you.

652
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:23,739
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

653
01:37:23,939 --> 01:37:28,453
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

654
01:37:28,654 --> 01:37:35,296
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

655
01:37:35,497 --> 01:37:39,995
all that is created, as peace.

656
01:37:40,838 --> 01:37:47,109
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.
