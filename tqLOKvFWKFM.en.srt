1
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,112
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

2
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,919
They had planned everything.

3
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,399
They had all the arrangements made

4
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,070
and the sari was missing.

5
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,910
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

6
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,664
so now what to do?

7
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:25,046
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

8
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,257
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

9
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:30,591
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

10
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,569
otherwise we can have it later.

11
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:37,632
But I was least disturbed,

12
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:40,777
least upset.

13
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:45,229
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

14
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:48,855
But if you have a mental conception,

15
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,020
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

16
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,233
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

17
00:01:55,353 --> 00:02:01,155
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

18
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,568
But that is what we cannot do.

19
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,823
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

20
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:12,121
This is what it is.

21
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,861
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

22
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,304
That’s one of the things.

23
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:25,141
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

24
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:30,798
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

25
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,394
because we make a mental projection.

26
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:36,794
Mentally we calculate something.

27
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:38,134
This has to be.

28
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:43,626
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

29
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:50,278
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

30
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:53,018
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

31
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:57,859
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

32
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,957
only about two o’clock.

33
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,317
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

34
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:05,141
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

35
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,567
So this is how you become avyagra.

36
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:16,120
Vyagra means person who is worried.

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,510
The one who is not worried.

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,096
So we worry because of two things.

39
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:30,202
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

40
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,122
Future doesn’t exist.

41
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,748
If you have made up your mind

42
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,513
that this should happen in the future,

43
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:42,282
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

44
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,885
But you have not made any mental picture,

45
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:48,203
you will see what comes on the scene.

46
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:52,936
You’ll watch whatever appears.

47
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:55,700
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

48
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,345
what’s going to happen.

49
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:03,961
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

50
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:07,692
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

51
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:14,774
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

52
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,993
and we are not having it.”

53
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,819
So you are upset.

54
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,695
What difference does it make?

55
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:28,034
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

56
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:30,330
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

57
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,987
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

58
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,323
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

59
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,622
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

60
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:46,279
We really decorated ourselves well.

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,077
We were all ready for the puja,

62
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:49,850
we were sitting here for the puja,

63
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,360
and now what has happened!

64
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:59,954
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

65
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:03,777
I knew what was coming.

66
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:14,673
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

67
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,096
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

68
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,189
I’m busy with Myself.

69
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:24,644
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

70
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:33,379
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

71
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,344
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

72
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:39,651
In India people come.

73
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:42,804
They keep so much money for buying things.

74
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:46,623
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

75
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,685
what you call traders.

76
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,711
The customs are so kind, I mean

77
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,910
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

78
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,341
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

79
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,369
And then they have a mental picture,

80
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:02,091
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

81
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,922
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

82
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:09,219
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

83
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:12,024
So then they might go to spend some money.

84
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:15,883
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

85
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:20,571
It has happened with all of you.

86
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,396
So they go and buy something.

87
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,419
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

88
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,932
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

89
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:33,129
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

90
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,050
How many pounds you paid for that?

91
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,916
Gavin: Forty pounds.

92
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,071
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

93
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:44,721
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

94
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,696
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

95
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:51,490
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

96
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,961
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

97
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:59,136
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

98
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,823
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

99
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,284
They thought they’ve bought something great.

100
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:07,716
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

101
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,498
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

102
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:11,395
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

103
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,382
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

104
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:19,354
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,878
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

106
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:28,231
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

107
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,632
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

108
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,176
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

109
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:36,297
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

110
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,188
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

111
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,964
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

112
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,056
He said, “What is the price?”

113
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:46,699
I said, “Forty pounds.”

114
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,774
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

115
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,400
And he bought it for forty pounds.

116
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,926
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

117
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:59,696
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

118
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,365
And I found it out that,

119
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:10,307
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

120
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:15,050
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

121
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,262
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

122
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,990
And if you start making it flexible then

123
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:26,595
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

124
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,199
very early. Now he’s different.

125
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,266
So if you become flexible,

126
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,162
then what happens you see the joy of it.

127
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,857
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

128
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,160
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

129
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,008
And you can never enjoy it,

130
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:51,054
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

131
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,450
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

132
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,292
You see it is all your own creation.

133
00:08:56,412 --> 00:09:00,325
The mental projection is your creation,

134
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:06,268
and also the destruction is your creation.

135
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:10,937
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

136
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,372
But who does that is Mahamaya,

137
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:19,277
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

138
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:23,522
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

139
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:25,504
I have to go to Birmingham.

140
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:30,949
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

141
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,446
After some time you will find

142
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:35,744
that it’s impossible to do something,

143
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:39,295
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

144
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,172
Because whenever you will try to do something,

145
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:45,974
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

146
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:49,830
If not, then it will make you realize

147
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,077
what is important, what you’ve missed.

148
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:58,551
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

149
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,832
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

150
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:05,063
What to do? Now where to go?”

151
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,779
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

152
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,431
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

153
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:17,248
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

154
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:23,328
for days together. I just see that there.

155
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:34,783
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

156
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:39,545
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

157
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:42,117
at any cost.

158
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:47,987
Then that acts as a guide

159
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:54,579
and you understand the flexibility

160
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,568
of all these worldly, transitory things.

161
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,561
They are all changeable,

162
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:06,301
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

163
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:12,643
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

164
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:16,943
which is very important subject.

165
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:23,297
I think I have talked about it many a times.

166
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:27,590
But in the West I must say,

167
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:35,277
because of our wrong attitudes

168
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,264
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

169
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:49,211
of other people who are very dominating,

170
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:56,451
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

171
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:02,470
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

172
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,509
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

173
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:11,043
and has sustained itself,

174
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:17,025
we must know that we can always fall a trap

175
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:26,441
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

176
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:32,673
It's a very serious matter

177
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:39,187
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

178
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:43,753
and we have created pathways

179
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,202
into which our attention can go

180
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:50,929
if we are not very careful.

181
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:56,250
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

182
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,843
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

183
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:05,968
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

184
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:09,380
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

185
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:13,625
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

186
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:24,694
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

187
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,566
sin against the Mother,

188
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:35,845
it's a secretive action

189
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:39,892
that's only between you and yourself.

190
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,874
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

191
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,684
Nobody knows what you are going to do

192
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:58,309
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

193
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:03,587
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

194
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:07,012
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

195
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:10,337
To be very frank with you,

196
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:15,647
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

197
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:23,534
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

198
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:31,213
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

199
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,611
It is not bothered.

200
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:38,059
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

201
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,764
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

202
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:43,988
that's the action it plays all the time.

203
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:48,071
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

204
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,638
I mean the person is very close to Me,

205
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,858
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

206
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:55,767
But still I can?

207
00:14:55,887 --> 00:15:00,441
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

208
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,914
immediately I can feel it.

209
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:10,196
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

210
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:13,997
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

211
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:16,454
do what you like.

212
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,538
Now for people who are Indian,

213
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:27,323
who have respected their Mooladharas,

214
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:30,264
there are so many methods and ways given

215
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:37,447
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

216
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,314
But that won't work out with the Western people,

217
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:45,054
because it's a damaged one.

218
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:48,921
It's one which is a shattered one,

219
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,597
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

220
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:56,794
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

221
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,568
the left side.

222
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:07,976
So, even you may not talk in that way,

223
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:13,210
but your mind is still in that realm.

224
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,796
And you still think on that realm.

225
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:22,880
Even mentally, you are in it.

226
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,971
Or you are seeing things,

227
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,988
wanting to see such things,

228
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:34,426
wanting to enjoy such things.

229
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:38,706
That lurking attraction is still there,

230
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:42,026
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

231
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,439
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

232
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,287
I would not say the same to the people from India.

233
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,866
So now we have to work out much harder.

234
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:06,413
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

235
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:12,631
And it is more a mental activity.

236
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,227
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

237
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:22,153
You have to watch your mind.

238
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:26,926
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

239
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:34,630
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

240
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,983
Where is it going?

241
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,143
Where is this movement of our mind?

242
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,914
What is it doing?

243
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,776
You have to stand against your mind,

244
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:50,616
stand against your desires,

245
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,796
or you can face it

246
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:58,386
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

247
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,818
It's for you to decide.

248
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:07,352
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

249
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:10,141
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

250
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,484
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

251
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,459
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

252
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,416
Whatever confessions you have made,

253
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,936
I burnt all those letters.

254
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:23,913
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

255
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,215
Nor do I want to know about it.

256
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:29,776
That's not My concern.

257
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:34,063
My concern is that now

258
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:41,823
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

259
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:46,692
on the same level,

260
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:51,293
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

261
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,496
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

262
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:00,690
the thoughts that come to you

263
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,178
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

264
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,819
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

265
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:14,451
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

266
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,185
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

267
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,544
which you can ask.

268
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:23,437
But you cannot always say that,

269
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:26,137
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

270
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:29,076
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

271
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:33,727
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

272
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:47,051
You see a person as a Sakshi.

273
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:50,777
That means you see that person

274
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:55,309
but you do not get a reaction,

275
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:02,060
which is killer of joy.

276
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:10,026
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

277
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:18,064
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

278
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,372
And be alert about it.

279
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:25,347
If you want to be kind to yourself,

280
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,423
know that you have to divert your attention

281
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:34,630
towards a sane married life.

282
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,752
But also that should not be too much.

283
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:41,730
Because what I have learnt now,

284
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,542
that in the West people have devised methods

285
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,071
of transferring their attention

286
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:51,982
from one person to another.

287
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:55,955
Mental acrobatics of different type

288
00:20:56,075 --> 00:21:01,803
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

289
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:06,176
Don’t play onto these.

290
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,943
There are so many other things by which

291
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:19,165
we express that we are still under the trap

292
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:21,119
of a bad Mooladhara.

293
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,554
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

294
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:27,147
the way you sit, the way you talk,

295
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:38,488
the way you behave, to impress other people.

296
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:45,287
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

297
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:48,439
The only impression that should really work

298
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,978
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

299
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:59,557
You can do it; it's not difficult.

300
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:03,298
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

301
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:08,127
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

302
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,509
But your question is first of all

303
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:15,306
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

304
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:21,131
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

305
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,669
That's why I say sometimes

306
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:29,001
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

307
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:33,829
especially the red meats and beefs,

308
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:38,716
and horses, and dogs

309
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,924
and I don't know what else you eat.

310
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,896
Take more to vegetarian food.

311
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:55,536
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

312
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,232
Take more to things

313
00:22:57,352 --> 00:23:01,077
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

314
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:06,730
Even fish is very [inaudible].

315
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,739
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

316
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:17,400
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

317
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:19,900
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

318
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,249
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

319
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:28,017
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

320
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:32,622
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

321
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:36,616
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

322
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,356
So for you people,

323
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,739
(You have to go?)

324
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:55,148
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

325
00:23:55,306 --> 00:24:00,733
that food does make a difference

326
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,643
in the powers of Mooladhara.

327
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:09,365
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

328
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:13,021
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

329
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,765
over-excited.

330
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,444
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

331
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:20,137
any woman you look at ...

332
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:23,761
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

333
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:26,218
Horrible.

334
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:29,599
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

335
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:35,217
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

336
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:37,980
There's no grace.

337
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,391
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

338
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,536
“you must respect yourself.”

339
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:48,265
It cannot work out with those words I know.

340
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:56,909
You have to sit down,

341
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:03,039
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

342
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:07,651
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

343
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,170
what things can be done about it,

344
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,134
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

345
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:17,303
But still this is all physical.

346
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:22,401
Mentally you must be on the watch

347
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,932
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

348
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:31,970
Why does it always go to this sensation?

349
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:39,333
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

350
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:45,159
see the beautiful people, just see them.

351
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,283
Another horrible thing in the West

352
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,872
is that the women must expose their body

353
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:54,273
to get men excited.

354
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:56,331
Men do the same I think.

355
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,100
They always try to excite each other

356
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,042
and live in a stupid excitement.

357
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:10,292
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

358
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:13,259
beautiful ornaments.

359
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:18,273
All right? But you're not a thing!

360
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:30,105
It's your private property.

361
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:34,949
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

362
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:38,197
Better try that, sometimes.

363
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:41,746
You will mind people plundering your gold,

364
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,446
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

365
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:49,352
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

366
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,374
You don't feel insulted?

367
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,274
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

368
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:59,747
It feels happy that people are watching you.

369
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:04,135
They are plundering you.

370
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,734
They are looting your chastity.

371
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,929
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

372
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,571
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

373
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:26,913
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

374
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,404
The minds are very funnily placed,

375
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:40,171
and that's why the greatest complications there are

376
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,458
in the brains of people.

377
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,764
They are very confused,

378
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:50,474
very confused people.

379
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:53,920
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,093
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

381
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,065
It is actually just the other way round.

382
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:06,925
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

383
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:10,188
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

384
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:13,401
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

385
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,960
And why not this property of yours

386
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,700
which is the highest of all,

387
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,624
to be preserved, to be adorned,

388
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:24,566
to be worshipped?

389
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:31,919
I'm quite worried on that point

390
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,362
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

391
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:40,531
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

392
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,834
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

393
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,497
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

394
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,236
but in this matter they think they can go about

395
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:51,098
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

396
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:55,166
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

397
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:59,454
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

398
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:03,560
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

399
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,268
towards your life, towards your being,

400
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:10,323
towards your personality. You are saints.

401
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,060
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

402
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,083
I call it the character, the essence of character,

403
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:19,811
is not a saint.

404
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:26,942
So this purity has to be maintained.

405
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:30,455
There cannot be any compromise on that.

406
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:34,547
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

407
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:38,752
If it works out,

408
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:43,498
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

409
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:46,779
nobody deceives oneself

410
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:51,349
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

411
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:54,685
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

412
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:57,325
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

413
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,968
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

414
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:04,351
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

415
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:08,468
your mind can be cleansed.

416
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:12,671
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

417
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:16,750
“not this, not this, not this.”

418
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:21,727
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

419
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:25,507
I know it's difficult,

420
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:29,874
but if you can get realization why not this also?

421
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,909
You all have to understand

422
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:36,456
that there is no compromise on this.

423
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:39,464
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

424
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,934
you will be thrown away completely,

425
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:46,434
just like any other devil is thrown out.

426
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,396
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

427
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,036
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

428
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:56,794
You cannot ascend

429
00:30:56,914 --> 00:31:00,885
if there is any lurking thing within you.

430
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:04,003
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

431
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:08,728
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

432
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,842
Only question is “where is your attention?”

433
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:18,265
Divert. Divert your attention.

434
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:25,386
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

435
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:31,768
and afterwards it will come automatically.

436
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,539
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

437
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,549
On the contrary,

438
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:43,654
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

439
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,991
So much conditioning is there.

440
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:51,604
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

441
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,730
we have ruined ourselves.

442
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,459
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

443
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:00,516
and the worst of all.

444
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:04,120
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

445
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,131
unless and until you individually

446
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:10,338
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

447
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:19,238
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

448
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:23,959
and the most powerful chakra.

449
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:32,517
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

450
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:39,820
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

451
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,794
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

452
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:45,854
your wisdom will fail.

453
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,826
You will have no sense of direction.

454
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:56,700
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

455
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,793
before they become forty years of age

456
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:01,454
is because their Mooladharas are out.

457
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,997
Most of the diseases which are incurable

458
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:09,283
come because of weak Mooladharas,

459
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,718
on the physical side.

460
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:14,841
On the mental side,

461
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:18,135
most of the mental problems we saw there,

462
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:23,919
most, I would say ninety percent,

463
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,463
are due to weak Mooladhara.

464
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,584
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

465
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:32,766
powerful Mooladhara,

466
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,686
it doesn't get into trouble.

467
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,724
Because you know there's a very strong hold

468
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:42,409
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

469
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:47,845
And when your mind goes off,

470
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:54,000
you blame the brain.

471
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:59,435
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

472
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:03,578
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

473
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:11,689
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

474
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:17,226
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

475
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,432
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

476
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:26,826
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

477
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,609
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

478
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:38,340
because the sensationalization

479
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,783
has become the main theme of modern life.

480
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:48,402
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

481
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:52,687
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

482
00:34:52,807 --> 00:35:00,866
Media, books, ideas, everything,

483
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:07,219
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

484
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,491
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

485
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:17,573
doesn't have any balance.

486
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,241
Actually he's hypocritical,

487
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:24,853
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

488
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,185
So many complications take place with this.

489
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:32,335
Before realization, forget the past.

490
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,506
Whatever you have done, forget it.

491
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:38,000
Just don't worry.

492
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,037
But remember one thing,

493
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:42,926
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

494
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:46,172
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

495
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,742
you have to bring it to normalcy.

496
00:35:48,862 --> 00:35:54,397
You have to make it a healthy,

497
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,720
balanced center,

498
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:07,029
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

499
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,338
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

500
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:19,026
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

501
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,492
We talk of innocence,

502
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,329
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

503
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:30,119
we must be on the full watch,

504
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,397
on the full alertness about our minds.

505
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:38,154
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

506
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:40,497
Where is this thief going?

507
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:43,179
Is he trying to do some tricks?

508
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:46,817
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

509
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:50,767
You have to be alert, very alert.

510
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:55,286
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

511
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:58,372
But now I have to tell you one thing.

512
00:36:58,497 --> 00:37:00,089
That you'll be exposed.

513
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:02,879
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

514
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,929
She'll expose you.

515
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,906
You'll be exposed

516
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:11,585
if you try to play tricks with Me.

517
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:14,225
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

518
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:17,039
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

519
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,769
you'll be exposed.

520
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:23,130
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

521
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:28,184
So please be careful, very careful about it,

522
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:34,548
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

523
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:37,685
and powerful.

524
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:41,110
May God bless you!

525
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,257
So our prayer should be that

526
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:56,347
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

527
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:59,932
That's all. Let’s pray.

528
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,805
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

529
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:21,018
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

530
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:22,896
Then he will pass it on to you.

531
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:28,657
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

532
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:31,840
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

533
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,540
should come and see him every month sometime,

534
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,912
and these things should be talked.

535
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:46,641
Because it's a secret,

536
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:48,124
not to be discussed openly.

537
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:52,109
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

538
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,693
It should not be written down anywhere.

539
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,962
It should not be mentioned,

540
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:02,526
but should be worked out by all of you,

541
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:08,256
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

542
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,961
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

543
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:18,299
Because men suffer much more than women do.

544
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,410
And that's why women must be very careful.

545
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,587
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

546
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:41,507
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

547
00:39:41,627 --> 00:39:45,319
men cannot be improved.

548
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,655
You have seen in India women don’t like it

549
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:51,057
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

550
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,874
They don't like it.

551
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:56,303
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

552
00:39:56,423 --> 00:40:00,827
thousands of them, because they thought some

553
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:05,189
other people may come and touch their body.

554
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:14,090
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

555
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:17,693
As if it is the body,

556
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:21,054
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

557
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:30,697
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

558
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:34,622
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

559
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:38,545
the power of their chastity.

560
00:40:39,475 --> 00:40:41,877
It's more for ladies here,

561
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:47,144
that they should try to generate that feeling

562
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,880
of nobility, of chastity,

563
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,681
of holiness around them,

564
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:59,085
so that the men themselves respect them

565
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:03,857
and develop that feeling within themselves.

566
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,567
Thank you very much.
