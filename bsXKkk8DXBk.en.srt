1
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:11,166
Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant

2
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:18,917
that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this earth

3
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,959
as Shri Krishna.

4
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:35,959
So many aspects of His being have been described

5
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:40,792
in so many of my lectures to you all;

6
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:45,375
but the greatest and greatest of all the aspects

7
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:49,375
of this Primordial Being

8
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:53,250
was that He was the Yogeshwara.

9
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:59,583
He was the God of Yoga - Yogeshwara.

10
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:12,750
He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.

11
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:21,083
Without His permission and without His sanction we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

12
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:33,041
He was Yogeshwara and a real Yogi is a person

13
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:42,917
who gets this Yogeshwara awakened within him.

14
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:47,875
The word "Yoga", that we understand,

15
00:06:47,875 --> 00:07:01,542
is the union of our attention with the Divine.

16
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:07,208
But still we do not realize the implications –

17
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:15,959
what does it mean? What should happen to us?

18
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,667
Of course you get powers.

19
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,291
As soon as you become the spirit you get powers.

20
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:26,000
One of the powers you get is of collective consciousness –

21
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,792
that is also the gift of Shri Krishna –

22
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:32,750
and that you start feeling the collectivity.

23
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:37,291
Your ego and superego is sucked in,

24
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:43,542
so you get rid of your karmas and your conditionings

25
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:48,750
and a new sprouting of the new life of the new age starts.

26
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:58,834
But still what is the speciality, the greatness of Yogeshwara?

27
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:10,083
Because He is Ishwara for you. He is the Ishwara of all the Yogis

28
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:18,166
and what is His capacity, what is His nature?

29
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:25,083
That for Him everything is a play - Leela.

30
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,458
For Shri Rama it was not a play.

31
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:41,959
For Him life was a platform on which he had to demonstrate

32
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:51,208
how to lead a very dharmic life as Maryada Purushottama.

33
00:08:51,250 --> 00:09:07,750
But Shri Krishna came up to show that He is the Leeladhara –

34
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,959
the one who plays the Leela, the play.

35
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:18,834
The whole thing is a play, the whole universe is a play.

36
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:23,291
All that is created by Adi Shakti, all these three gunas

37
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:30,959
is nothing but a play. And that is what He manifested

38
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:36,999
in His own incarnation. But still what is Yogeshwara?

39
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:43,250
Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play,

40
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,417
that He is at the axis, and for the whole periphery

41
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:57,500
is nothing but a play. Because everything is false.

42
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,917
Except for your spirit everything is false.

43
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,959
It’s all a joke going on, you can say,

44
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,709
a drama going on, nothing so serious.

45
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,500
Spirit is the only truth within us the rest is all untruth.

46
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:23,542
There cannot be many types of truths you see.

47
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,250
In Sanskrit language there is only truth or untruth,

48
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,709
satya or asatya, there are no ten words for truth.

49
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,208
So when this happens,

50
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,667
this great happening takes place within you,

51
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,667
when you become one with [the] Spirit you get powers

52
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:50,709
without even your maturity reaching that stage,

53
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,250
your understanding reaching that stage

54
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,500
and your heart opening out.

55
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:10,250
so that you have faith with open understanding.

56
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,792
You should have faith with experience of it

57
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:18,667
so it starts off. When you start using your powers

58
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,959
you see it is manifesting, you are sometimes amazed,

59
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,959
how you raise Kundalini of people,

60
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,583
how you tie them up, how you give them realization,

61
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,542
how you cure people.

62
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,667
You are amazed, how it has happened.

63
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,792
So we can say it is all built within you

64
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,875
which has started manifesting.

65
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:45,834
But there is so much more that has to still manifest,

66
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:51,625
which has to establish and make you grow.

67
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:56,625
One of the very important points is the Yogeshwara

68
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:02,166
and that point we must understand

69
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:10,917
that unless and until you follow the path of Yogeshwara,

70
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,500
you cannot establish yourself fully.

71
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:17,667
So Krishna has said that:

72
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,208
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

73
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,458
“You give up all your relationships…”,

74
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,875
dharma is relationship. Like your sister, your brother

75
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:38,041
you see these are dharmas, like Sri dharma  a woman's job.

76
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:43,959
Then we can say also there is Rashta dharma.

77
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,917
Today is the day of India's freedom.

78
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:54,041
So we have Rashta dharma, we are patriotic people.

79
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:59,458
Patriotism to your own country is Rashta dharma.

80
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,208
Then you have got Samaj dharma

81
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:10,999
that is duty towards your society, is Samaj dharma.

82
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,875
Then you have got Pati dharma, husbands' duties,

83
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:25,625
wives' duties. Everybody’s duties are called as dharmas

84
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,542
because this is what you have to do,

85
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,458
you are duty bound - they form your dharmas.

86
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,709
But He says, “Give up all these dharmas,

87
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,291
give up all the duties, just surrender yourself fully to Me”

88
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:44,166
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”.

89
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,875
Because you have become now the collective being,

90
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,834
now you have become one with Him,

91
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,208
now He looks after your dharmas,

92
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,208
He looks after your relationships,

93
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,542
He cleanses them, He purifies them,

94
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,792
so you just surrender yourself to Him fully.

95
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:08,500
He said it to Shri Arjuna only not to everyone.

96
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,333
He didn't say to everyone they didn't deserve it,

97
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,041
or He didn't think it proper to say to them.

98
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:18,125
But I think you are proper people to know this

99
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,792
so I'm telling you that: forget every other duty

100
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,625
to every other thing but do your duty

101
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:30,542
to your collective being, to your collectivity.

102
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:36,625
But He is Yogeshwara. That's the main point.

103
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,959
And to do duty to Him first and foremost thing

104
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,333
is you have to develop that purity of a Yogeshwara.

105
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:57,417
For Him sublimation was not needed  He was sublime.

106
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,709
He was the source of sublimation.

107
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,917
He did not need sublimation from the baser instincts

108
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,750
of human beings. He did not need anything to do,

109
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,041
to be done to Himself to raise Himself out of the maya

110
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,750
as they call it. Especially in the West, as you know,

111
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,125
we have created a hell for ourselves - real hell.

112
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:31,792
All kinds of perverted ideas are within us.

113
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,667
To a Yogeshwara this is nothing but maya,

114
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:42,208
absolutely filth. Never comes into His [mind]

115
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,417
that such things are possible - they are shocking.

116
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,375
On His birthday - I would say if today is His birthday

117
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:54,750
and if He was born as He was at that time –

118
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,959
He would have gone back immediately.

119
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:04,333
He would have said, “No sorry, I've nothing to do,

120
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,417
had enough.” And that too,

121
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,458
if He had met the Western culture,

122
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,834
He would have been shocked back

123
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,417
he [would have] said, “Oh God, no, nothing doing.

124
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,875
I'm not coming here.

125
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:18,667
Despite the times when He was born,

126
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,917
where there was dharma, there were people

127
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,834
[who] understood what was right, what was wrong.

128
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,458
When there was none of these nonsensical things

129
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,458
were there - He came as Yogeshwara - pure.

130
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:39,458
The story of His is that once His wives wanted to go...

131
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,667
to Him what was wives? Nothing - is just a play.

132
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:46,083
To Him no sin can be attached.

133
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,792
He married because He had to marry

134
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:53,917
His five principles or the five elements.

135
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,583
So He made them into women and married them.

136
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,291
He had to marry 16,000 women

137
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:04,417
because He had to have 16,000 powers

138
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:10,250
and He had to channelize them through some bodies,

139
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,375
so they came as women.

140
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:16,917
To Him it was not a relationship of a wife

141
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,750
but a pure relationship.

142
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,083
To Him sex had no existence at all.

143
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:28,417
He was beyond it.

144
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,208
So no question of temptations

145
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,625
and perversions - is out of [the] question.

146
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:38,542
The story is that once His five wives wanted to go

147
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:43,000
and pray to some saint who had come,

148
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,417
a great saint, to their town.

149
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,250
But he really stayed across the river.

150
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,125
So they wanted to go and worship him

151
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,959
and they found a very good time when they could go and see him.

152
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:08,250
So when they went near the river they said

153
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,125
“It is in spate we cannot cross it,

154
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,959
it's not the time that you can cross it.”

155
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:20,166
So they felt it was very inauspicious if they did not go

156
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,500
and that was such an auspicious time.

157
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:27,333
They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.

158
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,375
So they went to Krishna and said that

159
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,208
“Now, how can we cross, the river is in spate?”

160
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:39,542
He said: “Really? Doesn't matter.

161
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:46,792
You go and tell the river..” - that is the river Yamuna river,

162
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,000
no I’m sorry  Tapi, Tapi river..

163
00:18:50,041 --> 00:19:01,166
He said “Go and tell the river that ‘if we have a husband

164
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:08,834
who is Shri Krishna, is a Yogeshwara - that means

165
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,792
who has never indulged into any sex activity…”

166
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:15,625
Yogeshwara means a person who has never indulged

167
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,083
into any sex relationships.

168
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:24,041
That's not possible. One cannot think of such a thing.

169
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,250
Means though He indulged, He never indulged into [it].

170
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:35,250
Though He was in it still He was not there, like a lotus. “…

171
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:43,125
If He has not indulged into any such action…” –

172
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:49,166
it’s a… only possible for Him, nobody else.

173
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,000
That's why He is an incarnation,

174
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,750
He’s not a human being.

175
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,417
Only incarnations can do it.

176
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,333
If some human being starts saying that

177
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,750
“I am Shri Krishna, so I am doing this and I am doing that”,

178
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,750
like you see, there are very bombastic ones,

179
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,291
you must have heard about them.

180
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:08,417
They do not become, is only an incarnation can do it.

181
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:17,000
That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.

182
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,583
So they went and told the river that,

183
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,750
“If He is the Yogeshwara, then please you subside.”

184
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:33,166
And she went down. So they went to the other side,

185
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,458
did the puja to the guru and they came back.

186
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,583
Again the river was in spate and they could not cross.

187
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:43,542
So they went to the guru.

188
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:49,999
This is the sign of a good guru or a real guru,

189
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:55,542
is an incarnated guru. And they said that

190
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,250
“See, we cannot cross, the river is in spate."

191
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,291
So they said: “Really, how did you come?”

192
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,250
They said, "Shri Krishna asked us,

193
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:13,000
that ‘if I am the Yogeshwara, it will go down, you ask the question’.”

194
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,834
So he said: "All right, now you go and ask the question,

195
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:35,333
that if I am the bhukta. Bhukta, that means

196
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:39,208
if I have eaten all the food you have given me,

197
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,041
but I have not enjoyed it, I've not indulged into it,

198
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:48,166
then let the river subside."

199
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,166
They went and told the river,

200
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,917
I mean they could not believe it

201
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,417
because they had fed him, that:

202
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,250
"Whatever food we offered him,

203
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:03,166
if he has not eaten any food, then you subside".

204
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,000
And the river subsided!

205
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:16,375
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal,

206
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:25,834
your ideal again, in this respect, is Shri Krishna.

207
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:35,291
Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest.

208
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,333
This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do.

209
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,458
They think immediately they have become now

210
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,625
Shri Krishna or they have become something greater

211
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:57,542
or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves

212
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:02,667
It’s not so - that one thing one has to know,

213
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:10,500
that that is the ideal you have to reachand your eyes

214
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,375
should be towards that ideal and the movement

215
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,041
should be towards that. Before that,

216
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:20,875
if you fall into any such thing like perversions

217
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,750
and nonsensical sexual things and all that,

218
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,417
you must know that you are falling down very badly.

219
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:30,166
It's a possession that is working on you.

220
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:34,542
That's an ideal - they are incarnations.

221
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:38,667
You are not incarnations nor can you become incarnations.

222
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:43,458
But they are the light, which are enlightening your path,

223
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,000
on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm

224
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,166
where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.

225
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,750
He is Ishwara - He is your Ishwara.

226
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:59,458
You are not Ishwaras. But you are at least the Yogis.

227
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:05,875
We have to be the yogis first, then He is our Ishwara, nah?

228
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,959
Otherwise He doesn't want to rule you.

229
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:13,542
So what we have to do, is to become the Yogis first.

230
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:18,667
And one of the signs of a yogi is

231
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:25,999
that he is in his sex life extremely pure.

232
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:38,041
Absolutely purity must exist

233
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:42,083
and after some time one should get beyond.

234
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:50,667
Your relationships with other people,

235
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:55,458
whether it is your sister or a brother

236
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,250
or any other woman or any other man,

237
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:03,125
there should be complete purity.

238
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:09,417
And this is extremely important.

239
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:16,417
Now in the countries like India, people are extremely corrupt,

240
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:21,542
very corrupt, extremely corrupt. You can give them 5 rupees

241
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:24,083
and you can buy anybody there.

242
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:27,208
It's very corrupt, moneywise.

243
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,458
But people are not so immoral, they know it is immorality,

244
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,750
I mean they know. I mean if they do immoral thing

245
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:37,417
they know it is not moral.

246
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:41,999
In the West the immorality has become a general rule.

247
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,125
For them the ‘morality’ word should vanish now.

248
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,417
I mean it doesn't exist like morality.

249
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,000
Do anything whatever you like,

250
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,500
people don't think of immorality.

251
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:55,667
They don't want to talk of it, “it is Victorian.”

252
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,083
And if somebody says that one should be moral,

253
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,333
they start thinking he’s an hypocrite.

254
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,667
I mean they cannot think there can be any connection

255
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:07,125
between human being and morality in a genuine way.

256
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:12,000
This is a big problem we have. It's the biggest problem we have.

257
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:17,583
Now corruption is something you can avoid

258
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:22,792
because if you are not corrupt, it is alright, you can be.

259
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:26,083
But immorality is such a thing that,

260
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:33,041
if you live in an immoral world, it has effect on everyone.

261
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,959
For example, a moral woman is walking on the road

262
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,750
and there is a man full of lust and all that looking at her.

263
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,291
In any way she looses her chastity.

264
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,959
She doesn't mean to attract him or anything,

265
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,750
she doesn't want to loose her chastity,

266
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,959
but the way he is looking at her, you see,

267
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:56,083
though her simple methods are there, she may be responsible

268
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,583
in a distant way to ruin his chastity,

269
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:04,500
his morality. Even a little child, who is a simple,

270
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,709
innocent child but if there’'s a dirty man with a dirty eyes,

271
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,333
he can have very dirty feelings for the child.

272
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:16,208
So, though of course that person himself is dirty and all that,

273
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,250
we cannot say the child is not affected.

274
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,959
But in a way, that becomes an object,

275
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,500
a sort of a Vastu as you call it.

276
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:28,333
A thing which makes another person

277
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,417
even lower than what he is.

278
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:35,667
Even an ordinary picture, which has nothing to do,

279
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:38,458
is placed there, any funny thing

280
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,625
which is giving some dirty feelings.

281
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:48,750
Because these days I have seen so many symbols

282
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,625
have started, which to my eye I don't even see

283
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,542
there is anything wrong in it.

284
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,834
That to my eye I can't see because I'm too innocent.

285
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,750
My eyes can't see [that] there’'s anything wrong.

286
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:03,500
But to somebody, who is an expert on these things,

287
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,125
[he] will immediately say, “oh look at this.”

288
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:11,208
I mean really it is impossible to understand

289
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,917
how the human mind has really woven their yarns

290
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,291
all around and made these patterns

291
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,792
to ruin themselves and ruin others.

292
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:30,750
So to worship Yogeshwara we must know

293
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:37,834
that our relationships with everyone in this world

294
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,999
has to be pure.

295
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:46,709
He played lots of things in His lifetime.

296
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,625
The time when He came,

297
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:55,875
the whole country was absolutely drowned

298
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,542
into fanatic ideas about religion.

299
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:05,166
If Freud was there he would have said,

300
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,959
“oh this is all nonsense” you see, “What's wrong? Go ahead.”

301
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:13,875
Krishna did not do that.

302
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:20,583
He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles

303
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:27,625
of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism.

304
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:32,667
But He did it in a very beautiful manner

305
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:36,667
keeping the relationship absolutely pure.

306
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:41,959
Now people ask questions,

307
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,458
“Mother, was He married to Radha?”

308
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,375
You know He’s eternally married to Her, doesn't matter.

309
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:51,208
But He actually performed the marriage

310
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:57,375
just the day He was born. He was brought by His father

311
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:02,458
across the river and put down on the bank of the river,

312
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,959
when Shri Brahmadeva himself came on this earth.

313
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:10,959
That's why He wears a yellow thing, always,

314
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:15,959
as a blessing from Brahmadeva to cover His lower part,

315
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:21,333
lower than the waist with a cloth. That's the sign.

316
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,125
That's why He always wears yellow.

317
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:32,375
He himself came, made Him into man and married Him to Radhaji.

318
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:40,792
Then again He became a child just to appear to be a child.

319
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,083
Somebody may appear to be a child.

320
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,709
To some of you I appear to you to be a sixteen-year-old girl

321
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,000
as you say, but I'm not.

322
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:52,417
While I may be, according to counting,

323
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,792
might be sixty years of age, but I'm not.

324
00:30:55,834 --> 00:31:02,333
My age is eternal. I can't say what age is Mine.

325
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:09,041
It could be two years old or it could be absolutelyancient.

326
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,166
It could be anything.

327
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:19,542
So in His whole life, whatever He did,

328
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,959
He did with the purity of understanding.

329
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,709
So Radhaji was married to Him first.

330
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:32,917
And afterwards when He came as a child,

331
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:38,000
when He was a child, He did all kinds of pranks and things.

332
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,709
It was nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

333
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,208
It was not sitting like this and seriously telling about things.

334
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,709
But with little bit here and there

335
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:54,250
He tried to improve their chakras and raise their Kundalinis.

336
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,959
Of course realization was not possible in a game.

337
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,583
You cannot do it. Supposing I just play about with you

338
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,458
you cannot get your realization

339
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,959
because at the Sahastrara stage

340
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,500
you have to completely recognize.

341
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:22,000
It has to be a game of serenity.

342
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:27,208
Of course, you can just raise your hand

343
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,750
and give realization to people.

344
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,542
But you have to bring them to serene level.

345
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:37,166
If you just came andsaid, “alright, you now play about”,

346
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,500
it would be all finished.

347
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,542
You have to sit down and meditate.

348
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,083
Though He has said it in Geeta you have to do it.

349
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:49,667
So one could not say that all the time if you are playing,

350
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,750
if you are just singing songs,

351
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,625
or if you are in a very happy mood, a mirthful mood,

352
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,667
then it's the end of Sahaja Yoga. It is not.

353
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:03,667
It's a serious matter.

354
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:07,917
So He did not give them realization

355
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,917
but He reduced the tension on their minds

356
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:17,458
of the so-called dharma and its shackles of fanaticism

357
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:22,250
and He made it loose and then He wanted them

358
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,625
to understand that dharma is not

359
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:30,125
going to enslave you.

360
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,125
You have to rise above the dharma –

361
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:36,542
become dharma itself.

362
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:49,500
But Yogeshwara is to be worshipped with pure heart.

363
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:58,166
In this atmosphere it’'s difficult, I know.

364
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:02,625
You just go out and you see a horrid thing there.

365
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,208
You open any page of the magazine,

366
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,083
there’'s another horrid thing. Anywhere you advertise Me

367
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:13,208
the next page I turn I find a discotheque nonsense

368
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,417
going on there. I mean what can you do,

369
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:19,750
you just can’t help it. And all this is on, I mean,

370
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:25,041
if you look at it - how gross, dirty, filthy the whole thing is.

371
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:30,333
To add to problems, psychologists have come forward.

372
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:34,750
They themselves are affected by their methods

373
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,792
and everything, they are so possessed

374
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:44,250
and their sense about morality is absolutely in complete confusion.

375
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,709
No doubt about it.

376
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,834
You know Freud, what happened to him?

377
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,166
He was having relations with his mother.

378
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,333
He couldn’t even understand, I mean imagine

379
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,458
what a adharmi he must be, horrible wretched fellow,

380
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,375
he did not even have that purity to understand

381
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,834
relationship with a mother. I mean, imagine.

382
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:05,667
It is such a clear-cut background of this man.

383
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:08,542
Shows how wrong he must have been.

384
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:13,750
Because what was in him, such filth, such dirt,

385
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,417
that he could not even look at his mother with clear heart.

386
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:23,458
Must be all mud in his eyes or I don't know what he be like,

387
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,875
to see things like that.

388
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:33,709
You are shaking with my vibrations already.

389
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:40,166
Now when we think of Him as Yogeshwara

390
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:44,166
that means we are Yogis and He is our Ishwara.

391
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:53,291
Ishwara is to be praised - Dhayaati??

392
00:35:53,333 --> 00:36:01,083
you have to praise Him. You have to praise Him

393
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:07,041
for his quality as Yogeshwara because He is your Ishwara

394
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,999
so you have to praise Him.

395
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,959
Now what praise can we give Him.

396
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:17,959
Today He’s born. What should we do

397
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:21,333
on such a great occasion when He is born?

398
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:29,667
We have to decide that He is our Ishwara.

399
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:37,667
He is the Ishwara aspect and if He is our Ishwara

400
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:45,750
then we have to cleanse our attitude towards sex,

401
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:54,875
towards the gross way of life that we have developed,

402
00:36:54,917 --> 00:37:00,625
to just shun it and throw it away. Absolutely.

403
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:03,667
There cannot be compromise on that

404
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:12,750
otherwise you cannot be a yogi, you cannot be a yogi.

405
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:16,917
You may become very powerful, maybe for the time being.

406
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:19,208
Because I play with you, you get ideas

407
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:23,417
that you are very powerful and all that. But that's not true.

408
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:29,750
As My name is Nirmala, as My name is purity –

409
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,709
you have to be pure yogis.

410
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:38,709
Nobody says you should not marry.

411
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:42,000
Nobody says you should not have proper sex relationships

412
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,999
with you wives, that's not done.

413
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,542
But that's one thing people may avoid and spoil it.

414
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:56,291
But the other thing, which is the most important, is your attention

415
00:37:56,291 --> 00:38:04,166
to be pure of sex attractions [of] any kind.

416
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,834
Your attention should never go to anything like that.

417
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:22,375
You see to Me, I mean I'm now supposed to be an old lady, I don't see things

418
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:26,542
which normally people see. This is something surprising.

419
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,792
You see, I see something and I don't know what's happening

420
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:32,291
and everybody laughs at me in the house you see.

421
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:35,083
They don't understand that - how I didn’t see the point.

422
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,291
But I don't understand these jokes

423
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,417
because the attention never goes into these dirty things,

424
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,583
never goes into these things. I can't see,

425
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,041
till somebody tells me that ‘this is this.’

426
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,417
But they have to explain ten times.

427
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:54,625
So all these sophisticated methods of nonsense

428
00:38:54,625 --> 00:39:00,041
and the filth and the dirt that we have accumulated here,

429
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,125
please wash off your hands of that.

430
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:07,083
That’s one thing, will not be tolerated in Sahaja Yoga.

431
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,709
Every Sahaja Yogi I must tell.

432
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:15,709
Itself, sex cannot be enjoyed, if you live like this.

433
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,417
You cannot! You don't enjoy sex at all in this country.

434
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,792
None of them.

435
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,250
Only in a country, where people are innocent,

436
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,625
you can enjoy. If you were enjoying,

437
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,667
you would not run from one woman to another woman,

438
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:31,333
you would not run from man to woman and man to man

439
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,583
and then to all donkeys all those things.

440
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:42,417
It is impossible that you could be a yogi

441
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,375
with all these dirty ideas.

442
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:52,041
And then you cannot mature,

443
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,041
even a normal person won’t mature.

444
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,166
In India a person who is about 40 years,

445
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,333
he becomes a matured father.

446
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,667
You leave any girls with him, anybody with him,

447
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,583
it will not even get into his head

448
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,750
that there’s something could exist between them.

449
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,709
Once you are married it should not.

450
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,542
I mean I have seen my two son-inlaws,

451
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,750
they never get these ideas into their heads.

452
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:23,083
So try to put your attention onto proper track

453
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:26,291
because your Ishwara is Yogeshwara.

454
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,166
Now the other side of Shri Krishna

455
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,375
people do not know.

456
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:35,792
It's a play, all right. But He is Samhara-shakti.

457
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:43,583
He is the power of destruction. It's very good,

458
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,583
He’s there, comes with everything to protect us.

459
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:52,750
But He also has got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan,

460
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:57,834
’su’ means auspicious, "darshan" is vision.

461
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,834
He gives us auspicious visions, you see.

462
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:06,834
If you try tricks with Him, that goes round your neck

463
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:12,542
and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself,

464
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,375
that you are hanging in the air somewhere.

465
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:21,792
So Shri Krishna’s methods; on one side

466
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:28,291
He is a "Leelamayi", He is compassionate,

467
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:34,375
He stands by His bhaktas, He comes on this earth

468
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:39,999
to revive the dharma. If the dharma goes down,

469
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:44,792
He comes to uplift it. "Yada yada hi dharmasya" –

470
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:47,917
“whenever there is the decline of dharma.”

471
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,709
But dharma doesn't mean only corruption,

472
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,542
it doesn't mean only honesty and dishonesty.

473
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:59,333
Basically it means Mooladhara.

474
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:04,709
That is the beginning of the end.

475
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:09,208
And He comes to - "sa sansthapana arthaya" –

476
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:14,458
again to establish into the holy state.

477
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,000
He comes on this earth to raise human beings to that level.

478
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:35,166
This is what He does. So if we are Sahaja Yogis,

479
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:39,375
we are part and parcel of His Being.

480
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:46,500
We are instruments into His working.

481
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:50,083
So we have to establish dharma, but the one,

482
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,417
who has no dharma within himself,

483
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:55,750
what dharma is he going to establish anywhere?

484
00:42:55,792 --> 00:43:01,625
You have come on this earth to establish the dharma

485
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:06,792
in its holy aspect. Not like Roman Catholic church

486
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,999
or another Pentecostal church

487
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,291
or these Hindu religious activities

488
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,333
or these Hindu temples

489
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,999
or the Islamic state.

490
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:24,709
But dharma in its pure state you have to establish.

491
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,500
But if there is no dharma within us,

492
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,625
how are we going to establish?

493
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,291
So He comes on this earth every time

494
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,500
to establish dharma at Vishnu level.

495
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,834
But at Shri Krishna level, He comes at Yogeshwara.

496
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:45,291
This is the point many people have not even thought out.

497
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,041
For Vishnu they may not say Yogeshwara.

498
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:53,834
That is He is the Ishwara of Yogis,

499
00:43:53,834 --> 00:44:08,083
as Ganesha is the Ishwara of the Ganas.

500
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:15,208
You see, it’s the Ganapati [who] looks after the Ganas,

501
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,583
and He is our Ishwara.

502
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:25,041
That is we have to have Him as our ideal.

503
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:30,750
With the understanding that today is the day –

504
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,417
in the night about 12 o'clock,

505
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:37,166
now must be about 12 o'clock in India also, about that,

506
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:49,041
so it matches - He was born at this time in the night,

507
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:53,375
because it was real night symbolically,

508
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:58,500
under horrible circumstances.

509
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:05,375
He came, at a time,

510
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:13,208
when His own birth was very dangerously placed.

511
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:19,500
He was saved, and then, in His very childhood

512
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:30,959
He killed Rakshasas. But all this He did

513
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,542
because He was an incarnation.

514
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:35,999
Nobody is asking you to go and kill Rakshasas. Is it?

515
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,083
In Sahaja Yoga did I ask you to go and kill some Rakshasas?

516
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:43,625
On the contrary I’m just saying -keep yourself protected.

517
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:51,542
There was a Rakshasin who came, her name was Putana

518
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:58,667
and she wanted to put poison through her breast

519
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:02,875
and she took the child and started nursing.

520
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:07,166
He was a little baby. And when He started sucking her breast,

521
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:15,750
she came out in her true form and she died.

522
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:21,583
Because He was, after all, He was an incarnation.

523
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,792
Can anyone of us do that?

524
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,625
I mean the Sahaja Yogis?

525
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:34,875
Then as a child He was very mischievous.

526
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:44,667
He ate some clay, I think.

527
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:47,750
Whether He ate it or not, His mother doubted.

528
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,667
She got very angry and she said:

529
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,583
"Open your mouth, I would like to see, did you eat that?"

530
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:55,417
When He opened the mouth - she saw a complete universe

531
00:46:55,458 --> 00:47:02,208
moving in His throat - because Vishuddhi chakra She saw.

532
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,834
Because she could see. She had power to see, she could see.

533
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:09,500
Not…everybody can’t see that.

534
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:13,750
Those who have powers can see.

535
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,959
We don't even have the powers as much as she had

536
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,208
to see the universe.

537
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:29,959
So one has to understand that first, as Sahaja Yogis,

538
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:35,000
we get the powers much before we have passed,

539
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,667
really, the test of Sahaja Yogis.

540
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:43,709
Just the other way round it is.

541
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:48,000
In the university they will first give you the degree,

542
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,458
the certificate and then you will get a job,

543
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,458
may not get job also, these days!

544
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:04,917
Here you get the job first of all, you get all the powers

545
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:09,709
you are paid for, but the degree is still not sure.

546
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,458
Anybody walks about as Sahaja Yogi,

547
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,458
next day I find him coming out with something else.

548
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:23,583
They are certified Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

549
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:31,083
They become afterwards certified something else.

550
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:35,208
God knows how. So this is the thing of Sahaja Yoga

551
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,917
that you can become a Sahaja Yogi

552
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:41,917
even without having the real certificate.

553
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:47,583
It's definitely so. And the certificate is given,

554
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,208
as you know, by Lord Jesus Christ.

555
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:55,208
He doesn't give certificate easily.

556
00:48:55,208 --> 00:49:00,500
That way He is very, very strict.

557
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:06,083
He is not going to give you. He’'s extremely strict

558
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,375
as far as the Sahaja Yogis are concerned,

559
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,375
He’'s not going to give you certificates,

560
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:16,750
He’s going to judge you. And what is His basic nature, is He’s innocence.

561
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:21,125
He is going to judge you on your innocence.

562
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:25,208
If you are a superego you can say,

563
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh I got possessed by a bhoot, you see,

564
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:30,000
and the bhoot did this. So He will say:

565
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:34,041
"Alright you go to the bhoot for the certificate not to me."

566
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:38,208
Even when Yogis fight, I’ve seen, they tell me,

567
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,333
“Mother, must be my bhoot and his bhoot must have fought”.

568
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,500
And what were you doing?

569
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:52,000
They were witnessing it like Shri Krishnas!

570
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:56,792
With all these things happening,

571
00:49:56,834 --> 00:50:08,125
I get a big promise sometimes, that, "Mother, alright,

572
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,959
now we are not going to quarrel,

573
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:15,792
there’s not going to be any problem, you rest assured,

574
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:22,333
we'll all live in harmony." Then suddenly I find

575
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,875
that somebody is fighting for a bathroom

576
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:28,166
or for a soap or something like that.

577
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:32,125
That's not for a Sahaja Yogi to behave.

578
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:37,959
First of all you have to be a satisfied person,

579
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:43,291
a person of great dignity and forbearance,

580
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:46,917
otherwise what are you going to bear?

581
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:59,166
"I love him very much, but he should not have taken my towel."

582
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:05,291
For small, small things if you go on insisting,

583
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:12,750
be sure you are not a yogi as yet.

584
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,792
If you are fighting for things,

585
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:18,583
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

586
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,041
What do these things matter?

587
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,625
I never say anything about anything, do I?

588
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,750
That “I must have this, I must have that,

589
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,375
how did you prepare this?”

590
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,125
Though it is sometimes really wrong and unprotocolish.

591
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,875
I never say that, “Why did you bring these bananas,

592
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:35,458
they are no good, I'm not going to eat!” Did I say so?

593
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,333
I mean, even the flowers you use may not be auspicious.

594
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,208
I know certain flowers should not be used for puja.

595
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,208
But I have not opened my mouth. If I have to tell you,

596
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,291
I just tell you because you have to know it

597
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:53,625
for your own good, not for my good.

598
00:51:53,667 --> 00:52:01,709
So, on a day like this, which is a day of great joy

599
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,417
to all the world, and happiness,

600
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:08,792
you should know one thing, that, when Christ was born,

601
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,208
he was born in a very humble place,

602
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,458
but when Krishna was born,

603
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:22,917
He was born in the most horrifying circumstances.

604
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:29,375
Same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today.

605
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:32,041
It's a thing of great joy and jubilation, no doubt,

606
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:35,041
that He came and he gave us His Vishuddi power,

607
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,959
but we must understand that we are born

608
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,542
in a very precarious time.

609
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:43,625
I’ve been saying this so many times.

610
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:47,542
There’'s not only one Kamsa there. So many are there.

611
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,166
There’'s a big fight going on,

612
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,417
in that you people are here in charge.

613
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:57,375
You are the ones employed by God, you are the ones,

614
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:05,583
who have been given this great work. You have powers.

615
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:08,000
Like Shri Krishna, when He was crossing,

616
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,458
as a child was put in a basket

617
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,250
and the father was carrying the child in the basket

618
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,667
and when His feet touched the river Yamuna,

619
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,917
the river went down.

620
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:22,458
Because she was in spate, she went down.

621
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,166
In the same way, you too have all these powers.

622
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,959
Krishna has given you all the powers.

623
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:33,375
Though they will be really known to you,

624
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:39,959
when only Lord Jesus Christ accepts you as Sahaja Yogis.

625
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:45,999
That's important because you have to be innocent.

626
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,875
Purity must be brought in.

627
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:55,166
Last time on this great day we had 16 marriages.

628
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,208
They came out well most of them.

629
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:02,667
Not all, but most of them were very good

630
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:04,583
and I am really very happy

631
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:08,083
that such good couples came on that day.

632
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,667
It was very auspicious.

633
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:19,250
And marriage gives you a sense of purity

634
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:27,125
and that's why our marriage is important in Sahaja Yoga.

635
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:31,291
But that's not the last word, like this is not

636
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,125
a hunting ground for everyone,

637
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:36,208
“I'm finding out this husband or I'm finding out that husband.”

638
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,875
That must be stopped completely. Leave it to Sahaja.

639
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:43,834
You are not to search out your wives in Sahaja Yogis,

640
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:47,000
no, not at all, nor husbands! Leave it!

641
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:55,083
If you have done something like that, then you may be harmed.

642
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,417
Don't do any searching or any thing.

643
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:02,333
A time will come, when you will find,

644
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,500
I will myself tell you “alright, marry this person.”

645
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:08,375
It’s still on among Sahaja Yogis, I have known people

646
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:12,375
who just take out people and try courting.

647
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:15,417
That's not needed in Sahaja Yoga, no courting needed.

648
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:17,125
See, we have got so many cases,

649
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,917
where the marriage was decided like that,

650
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,792
they married, they are very happily married,

651
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,583
than people who had courting, this thing, selections,

652
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,375
and nominations and elections and everything.

653
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:32,917
And after that you find within 2 days they are out for divorce.

654
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:37,208
In Sahaja Yoga it is spontaneous,instantaneous.

655
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,834
You don't have to do all these things

656
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,542
with all these deliberations what have you achieved?

657
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:48,041
It's just spontaneous. So you don't have to worry

658
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,999
and you don't have to think. You don't have to say,

659
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,542
that "Oh Mother, I have to find a girl for me"

660
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:58,125
You see, you don't! Leave it me, it's my headache.

661
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,834
But once you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

662
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,166
you must know what it means.

663
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:06,834
And both of you must work it out properly

664
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,291
and it is for the good of everyone.

665
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:18,500
Should be good for everyone.

666
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:30,917
So, this is what it is. And I would say that, on this day,

667
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:34,917
let us take one vow:

668
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:03,792
To decide that we will be worshippingYogeshwara.

669
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,667
We have to worship Him.

670
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:12,458
Means our relationships about these things has to be clean.

671
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:16,583
We should not get involved into it, it’'s nothing important.

672
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:21,125
It's just like having your food,

673
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:29,583
you have to be with your wife. Is the need of the body.

674
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:42,500
You don't eat from the dirty plates, do you?

675
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,709
You want to have a clean plate.

676
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:49,166
You want to have a plate, which you have used yourself,

677
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:53,999
your own plate that should be clean.

678
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,875
If you could have a cleaner plate, you would like to have,

679
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,959
if you can get a silver plate, you would like.

680
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:02,583
If it is even a golden plate is even better.

681
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,625
In the same way, we should also have

682
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:13,000
a very pure understanding that, it is the need of the body,

683
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,875
the body which can be very subtle.

684
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:23,999
So let us not just go on shopping for it everywhere,

685
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,250
looking out, “oh this is that, this one that one,”

686
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:34,917
then discard this one. It has to come to you specially.

687
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:40,709
And all great things happen suddenly. Always.

688
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:48,917
The more deliberations you will have, the worse it will be.

689
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:56,375
So don't form ideas, don't plan about it.

690
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:59,834
It will happen. It’'s not so important.

691
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:07,083
That will give you a lot of purity. Your ego will be perfect.

692
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:14,291
I know of someone, whom nobody wanted to marry.

693
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:19,000
And when I suggested someone,

694
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:21,875
who agreed with great difficulty, she said,

695
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:32,041
“I don't want to marry.” It's funny. It is very funny that,

696
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,583
the way our ego is working out. Because, you see,

697
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:38,291
when we are looking at another person for marriage or anything,

698
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,917
we are not thinking of Yogeshwara.

699
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,542
We don't think that it is Yogeshwara,

700
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,166
who will do everything for us, we are thinking,

701
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,250
we have to do it. Alright, so we go ahead with this,

702
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:55,750
that, and spoil our attention completely.

703
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:00,583
"“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

704
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:06,875
In this part of your decision, if you can leave it to God,

705
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:15,125
it would be better. I tell you, if you can do that,

706
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:19,291
you have crossed your ego half way through.

707
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:24,709
Because at least 50% ego is used in this.

708
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:27,542
In the West especially.

709
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:30,667
In India this question doesn't arise much.

710
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:35,999
Because the parents can't decide here, nobody can decide,

711
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,250
you have to decide yourself. It's a big responsibility

712
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,709
and a big thing for you.

713
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,667
So 50% of your ego problem will be finished,

714
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:54,458
I tell you, once you just give up this responsibility

715
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:06,125
of choosing a bride or a bridegroom for yourself. Just forget it.

716
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:12,834
Such a waste of energy, I tell you.

717
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:19,500
When I see people, young people, doing all these things

718
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:23,041
I wish they could understand the value of their lives,

719
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:29,875
the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna.

720
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:40,834
He’'s not Ishwara of everyone, only of yogis.

721
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,750
Anybody else who tries to say

722
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:47,041
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" will get throat cancer.

723
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:52,625
Anybody who tries to call Him

724
01:01:52,667 --> 01:02:00,000
who is not a yogi gets a problem in the throat, you know.

725
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:11,500
So He is only available to you, He is only your Ishwara.

726
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:20,417
He manifests only for you. He is your own.

727
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:26,125
He won't act for any Dick, Tom and Harry.

728
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,083
Maybe you might be a prime minister,

729
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:31,166
you might be a king or queen, it makes no difference to him.

730
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:36,417
To him only a yogi, only a yogi can call him.

731
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:40,583
Only a yogi can ask for his help.

732
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,959
He is not bothered about anybody else.

733
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:53,291
And if a yogi recommends, then only He can look after someone.

734
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:56,959
Otherwise He will not bother about him.

735
01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:10,583
So He is actually your own king, who is always there,

736
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:17,834
looking after you. When you call Him,

737
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:25,375
He comes with all His powers to support you.

738
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:32,667
But you have to be a yogi. If you are not a yogi,

739
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:39,208
which is of course certified by Lord Jesus Christ,

740
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,458
then Krishna has nothing to do with you.

741
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,999
So before the entry to Shri Krishna,

742
01:03:45,999 --> 01:03:49,792
though He is not the one who is going to judge your innocence,

743
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:57,166
in the door resides Lord Jesus Christ.

744
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,458
When you get in, then it's all right.

745
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:07,083
But to get in, also is difficult because He’'s always throwing you out.

746
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:16,250
Shri Krishna has said, that "You will be the ...",

747
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:21,417
to Jesus, He said, "You will be the Adhara, the support of the universe."

748
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,041
Means the innocence is your support, innocence.

749
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,792
If that innocence is not established in you,

750
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:33,999
then Shri Krishna cannot help you. He is helpless.

751
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,792
Because you don't become a yogi and

752
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:41,667
so He’'s not your Ishwara any more.

753
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,999
Now one may say that, “Mother the Agnya chakra

754
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:49,542
is here and He is here,” Alright,

755
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:56,834
but Agnya chakra when you cross, here he is.

756
01:04:56,875 --> 01:05:03,542
When, you cross your Agnya chakra,

757
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:07,999
that means He is sitting there and the Virata is sitting here.

758
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,250
So unless and until you pass your Agnya Chakra

759
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:20,625
properly, you can't get to Virat.

760
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:24,667
And Yogeshwara is the Virat.

761
01:05:24,709 --> 01:05:32,583
That is the aspect we have to worship, we have to worship!

762
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:37,375
Worshipping doesn't mean that you become that person.

763
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:40,291
You worship Me, you don't become Me.

764
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,875
What do you do, when you worship?

765
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:49,083
You surrender all that is not liked by Me,

766
01:05:49,125 --> 01:06:03,166
in the fire, in the water, outside. In the elements you throw them away.

767
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:09,208
And you bring to Me your heart. That’'s what it is, worshipping.

768
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,750
In the same way we have to worship the aspect

769
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:19,000
of Shri Krishna in me, which is Yogeshwara.

770
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,208
I am Yogeshwara.

771
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,625
Things do not come into My head at all,

772
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,959
I don't see things like that.

773
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:30,417
I don't know what is temptation is, what attraction is,

774
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:34,792
I just don't understand. On the contrary

775
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:38,959
these things repel me, repel absolutely, I vomit.

776
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:44,625
Even to hear these things, I don't want to open My ears,

777
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:48,875
My ears become deaf. I can't hear these things.

778
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:51,500
I can't understand any dirty jokes.

779
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:54,750
I have no brains [for this]. My brains refuse to understand.

780
01:06:54,792 --> 01:07:04,375
I become a dull person, absolutely. Deaf and dumb.

781
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:07,083
People have written books and books on these things,

782
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,750
I don't know what they must be writing.

783
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,709
What is there to write on this?

784
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:19,208
So today we have to know that our personal life

785
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,583
has to be extremely clean.

786
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:25,208
We face ourselves every moment

787
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,250
and find out within ourselves –

788
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:30,750
are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves

789
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:36,709
who resides within us? Let us develop that purity.

790
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:42,625
Then innocence will be established in our eyes.

791
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:46,959
We'll be innocent. The eyes will speak of innocence.

792
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:50,792
What's the use of having eyes,

793
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:54,458
which are all the time shifting,

794
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,750
you don't know where they are going, wobbling eyes,

795
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,750
you see, like this, like this, like this.

796
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,500
You can't trust these eyes at all.

797
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:07,291
But the eyes, which are innocent,

798
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:15,999
receive nothing they just give. They just give.

799
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,500
Innocence is very penetrating, very purifying,

800
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:29,709
very soothing and very beautiful.

801
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:37,375
We have to become beautiful people.

802
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:44,083
Today I said on these things

803
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:50,625
because I'm sometimes disturbed the way people

804
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:56,500
don't understand that purity of sex life

805
01:08:56,542 --> 01:09:00,792
is so important to Sahaja Yoga, especially in the West.

806
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:04,333
People don't understand.

807
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:08,834
To Indians this lecture has no meaning, they will think,

808
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:11,333
“Why Mother is wasting Her energy so much?”

809
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,875
Because they don't understand.

810
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:19,667
But to Me it is very important here.

811
01:09:19,709 --> 01:09:28,500
Whatever I have seen and heard and see all around.

812
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:35,250
I think today's message should be of Yogeshwara.

813
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:39,625
Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

814
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,583
When you worship Me today,

815
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:47,041
it should be the worship of Yogeshwara and nothing else.

816
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:51,125
May God bless you.
