1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:02,222
On a Guru Puja

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:08,171
The Guru doesn't give any presents to the disciple.

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:10,999
Mother can give, but not the guru

4
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:15,938
And that's why I'm sorry today 
I won't be given any present.

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:20,462
But  I have given a very good lecture for you.

6
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:45,417
Thank you very much from all the countries
beautiful present they have given me.

7
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:51,180
It's very suprising how beautifully people are creating things

8
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:56,000
and you know a self realise people are creators.

9
00:00:56,057 --> 00:01:00,632
You have to create sahaja yogis first and all other things.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,445
So, you are creators you can do it.

11
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:06,391
It's not think a diffucult for you.

12
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,158
It is very simple and you learn the art very soon.

13
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:13,066
And I'm sure, it will workout very fast.

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,817
So you'll go ahead know for creating more sahaja yogis all over the world.

15
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:19,961
Thank you very much
