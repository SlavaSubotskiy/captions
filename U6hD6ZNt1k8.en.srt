1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:11,560
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:20,680
I think this is the most important puja

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,880
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,960
that has given you Self Realisation,

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,840
that has given you the Truth,

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,960
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:06,040
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:26,280
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:36,720
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,160
With Her love, She did this great creation,

11
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,680
creation of this world also.

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,280
This is a specially selected planet,

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,040
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,640
between the sun and the moon

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,000
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:30,320
This is Her great work with such love and affection

17
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,280
and with very great hope

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,480
that Her children will know the truth

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,320
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

20
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,600
and about everything else.

21
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,120
As you have read in the Bible

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,920
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
and told human beings

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,360
that you have to know the knowledge,

25
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

26
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,560
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

27
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,000
because they would have remained just like animals,

28
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,960
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

29
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
little higher animals maybe  —

30
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:57,240
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

31
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,160
that there is something wrong the

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,280
way they are without any clothes,

33
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,800
so they brought some leaves of the tree

34
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,400
and covered themselves.

35
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,800
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

36
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,160
because Shri Ganesha was established

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:36,320
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

38
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,400
that we have to cover our bodies.

39
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,960
We are no more animals.

40
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,080
Only the animals

41
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

42
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
are not aware of it.

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,040
With the knowledge of chastity,

44
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,360
gradually human beings started growing

45
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,080
into beautiful nations,

46
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,360
but there are so many things,  which were still to be known,

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,760
to be aware of it.

48
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:32,440
You may be aware of many things,

49
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:45,880
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

50
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,520
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

51
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,000
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,720
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,440
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

54
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,920
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

55
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,760
and they are trying to protect people

56
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,680
from wars and creating

57
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,320
great, huge, protecting instruments.

58
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

59
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,640
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

60
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,760
of competition, ambition,

61
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,280
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

62
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,120
They're fighting for a piece of land.

63
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
So ignorant they are.

64
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

65
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,080
when you die?

66
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,320
When you are born you come with closed fists.

67
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,520
When you die you go with open hands.

68
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,680
What do you take with you?

69
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,640
All right, you may not like to take anything,

70
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,040
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

71
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,480
for which you are fighting?

72
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

73
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:21,200
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

74
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,440
give up their understanding

75
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,200
when it comes to a piece of land.

76
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,040
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

77
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,480
and going towards complete destruction.

78
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:57,400
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

79
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,520
because of all their ignorance,

80
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,960
by which they have all those habits,

81
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,800
all those attractions,

82
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,560
all those identification, which is ruinous,

83
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,280
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

84
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,880
They have to take to sense

85
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,320
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

86
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Self knowledge is the key

87
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,240
for a saviour to give to people.

88
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,920
We have had so many saints.

89
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,200
We have had so many Sufis.

90
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

91
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,160
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

92
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,120
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

93
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,120
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,160
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

95
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
truth that encompasses everyone,

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,680
that brings the complete view of our existence.

97
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,320
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

98
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,440
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

99
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,840
powers are such

100
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
of love and compassion,

101
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,960
that makes you understand your self first.

102
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,400
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

103
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,080
There's no awareness of your own being.

104
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,200
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

105
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,360
how much you have to be seriously

106
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,200
becoming aware of your self first.

107
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
That is extremely important.

108
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,280
First you have to be aware of your self.

109
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,640
And now you have the light of your spirit.

110
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,560
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

111
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,360
and you can see how far you are going,

112
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,160
how wrong things you are doing,

113
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,680
what harm you are doing to yourself

114
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,200
and you have a power to cure it,

115
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,560
to improve it and to come to your senses.

116
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
These are the most important times.

117
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,440
You will never get these times again.

118
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

119
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,320
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

120
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,560
not only the self knowledge,

121
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,760
but you know how to do it.

122
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,280
Otherwise, about the saints,

123
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,960
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

124
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,800
they have just described

125
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,720
what a person with self knowledge is,

126
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,920
how he behaves, how his style is,

127
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
how he's so different from others.

128
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,280
But none of them have said how you become that.

129
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,920
No one has been able to say that.

130
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Nobody has been able to do that also

131
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,680
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

132
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:02,040
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

133
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,280
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

134
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:17,720
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

135
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,240
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

136
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,960
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

137
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,440
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

138
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,880
much stronger, much more powerful.

139
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

140
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,160
and when She rises you know what happens to you

141
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,400
and how you get your Realisation.

142
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
But you have to be very watchful.

143
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,360
Are you really a compassionate person?

144
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,920
If you are compassionate,

145
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,600
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

146
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,480
I think, will be to help others,

147
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
to emancipate others.

148
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,880
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

149
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,080
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

150
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,680
It cannot happen.

151
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,160
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

152
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,012
to work so hard?

153
00:15:55,173 --> 00:16:00,160
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

154
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,800
but, from my very childhood

155
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,360
I've worked very hard

156
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,800
and I've gone through very difficult times,

157
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,840
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
but the worst time I have, when I see

159
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,400
those people whom I have given Realisation,

160
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,520
those who are self-realised people,

161
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,320
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

162
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,360
and, if they have, it is very little.

163
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,680
They don't have that compassion

164
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,720
and don't have that love

165
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,560
that we have to today save the world,

166
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,960
save the humanity.

167
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,360
That's our — not only our principal work,

168
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,360
but the only work that we have to do.

169
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,880
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

170
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,800
except for your own efforts here,

171
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,640
individual efforts

172
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,120
to give Self Realisation to others

173
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,120
and give them this knowledge.

174
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,160
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

175
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,800
It is very subtle, no doubt,

176
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,720
and, as I've told you,

177
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,080
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

178
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,160
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

179
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,440
and they are trying to find out something about it.

180
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,640
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

181
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,920
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

182
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,160
that has happened to you.

183
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,880
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

184
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,600
even if you have starved yourself,

185
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,080
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

186
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,960
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

187
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,920
you could not have got your Realisation.

188
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,520
That would not have been possible.

189
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,160
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

190
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,920
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

191
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,480
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

192
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Just to see that you all are created

193
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,760
and you're all My hands.

194
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,720
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

195
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,720
And that is what I have been telling you,

196
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:29,240
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

197
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,400
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

198
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,360
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

199
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,640
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

200
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,520
Try to understand this.

201
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,480
It's not work of any saint.

202
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,240
It's not work of any incarnation.

203
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,280
It's not work of any politician.

204
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,720
And not work of any big leader.

205
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,920
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

206
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,280
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

207
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,320
Now it is for you to see.

208
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,720
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

209
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:46,400
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

210
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,480
The greatest thing you can do for Me

211
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,920
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:03,160
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

213
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,360
You didn't have to do any efforts.

214
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,600
You didn't have to pay any money.

215
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,520
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

216
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,720
You got it spontaneously.

217
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,280
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

218
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,480
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

219
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,720
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

220
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:59,760
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

221
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,840
People have tried to spread their religion

222
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,680
by showing compassion to poor people,

223
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,800
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

224
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,400
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

225
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,720
What they have to do is to transform other people.

226
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,160
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

227
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,120
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

228
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,760
Put your mind to it

229
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,440
and you will know how you can manage it.

230
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:55,000
There should be all the time compelling desire

231
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,000
that we have to find out method

232
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,960
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,160
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

234
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,280
that some seed fell on the marshy land

235
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,760
and they sprouted, but never grew.

236
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,200
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

237
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,120
and become something very, very special and real

238
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,080
by knowing what you can do.

239
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
I have a vision, no doubt,

240
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,680
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

241
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,320
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

242
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,360
I know some countries are very difficult.

243
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,600
Try to find out what is the problem,

244
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,720
why it is so very difficult.

245
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,960
Attention has to be paid to this,

246
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:27,720
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

247
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,400
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

248
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,320
which we call as the last judgement,

249
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,160
but let us, through our compassion and love,

250
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,280
save as many as possible.

251
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

252
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,200
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

253
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,960
They're all there, no doubt.

254
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,040
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

255
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,800
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

256
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,640
which is very great,

257
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,600
which is very penetrating,

258
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,800
which is miraculous.

259
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
It's so effective,

260
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,360
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

261
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
how will you work it out.

262
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,080
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

263
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,440
but nobody is there to work it out.

264
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,480
All the time I had to go through very,

265
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,560
very hazardous times

266
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,480
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

267
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,560
the way things are so difficult for Me.

268
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,200
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

269
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,320
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

270
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,920
but those who walk on that,

271
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,240
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

272
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,680
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

273
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,840
'Let many walk on this road,

274
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
which was created with such

275
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,800
patience, understanding and love.'

276
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,560
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

277
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,200
doing your level best to change this world

278
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
— has to be changed.

279
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,280
As it is, humanity has to be saved

280
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,160
through you and nobody else.

281
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,920
No president, no prime minister,

282
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
no minister,

283
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,320
none of these people can change the world

284
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
and save it.

285
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,320
It is you who are entitled.

286
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,920
You have got this power.

287
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,880
Do you realise your own status?

288
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,680
Your own being?

289
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,400
which has risen so high?

290
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,440
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

291
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,440
you would go all out

292
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,560
to express your love and compassion to other people,

293
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,960
to make them realise what they are.

294
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,200
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

295
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,640
There's no other way out.

296
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:11,520
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

297
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,120
is something very, very superficial.

298
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

299
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,960
We have seen children. They're coming up.

300
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,800
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

301
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,040
But before them, you have to show your own merits

302
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
of what you have done.

303
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,160
It's not a static work.

304
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,720
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

305
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:03,240
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

306
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:16,240
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

307
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,600
You are the one[s] who have to build up

308
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,360
the destiny of human beings.

309
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,240
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

310
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,880
You could never have got your Realisation.

311
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,120
You'd never have come to Me.

312
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,600
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

313
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,880
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

314
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,960
You know it cannot be forced.

315
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,760
This Realisation cannot be forced.

316
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,080
This awareness cannot be forced.

317
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,280
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

318
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,840
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

319
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,440
And see for yourself what you have done,

320
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,760
what you have done.

321
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,160
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

322
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,720
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

323
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,280
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

324
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,480
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

325
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,240
and is very powerful.

326
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Power will be achieved by them

327
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,800
— power of love and compassion,

328
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,200
which is not only words of love.

329
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,960
It is not only act of loving others,

330
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:05,320
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

331
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,920
which will just emit

332
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:19,400
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

333
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:31,040
All should just take a very brave personality.

334
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,120
I must say people have improved,

335
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,400
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

336
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,720
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

337
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,280
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

338
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,080
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

339
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,920
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

340
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,440
people who have failed,

341
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,400
people who are still in a state

342
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:19,680
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

343
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,960
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

344
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,200
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

345
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,800
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

346
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,880
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

347
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,520
Why? Is that My job?

348
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,880
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

349
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,320
can be cured by photographs,

350
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,640
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

351
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,200
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

352
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,960
mentally, emotionally, financially,

353
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,040
also in the marriages,

354
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,040
that's not your job,

355
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
neither Mine.

356
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,320
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

357
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,920
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

358
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,760
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

359
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,800
if it fails, to write to Me

360
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,400
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

361
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,440
What's so important?

362
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,280
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

363
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,640
Why not use them first?

364
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,960
Our job is not to cure people.

365
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,000
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

366
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,880
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

367
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,520
or to the people who are suffering,

368
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:27,960
but what about Sahaj Yog?

369
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,600
If you have one sick person,

370
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,880
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

371
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,280
What is the reason?

372
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,360
Is it compassion?

373
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,720
It's not.

374
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,000
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

375
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,880
Is not compassion.

376
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,320
Compassion today is

377
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,840
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

378
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,640
into good people.

379
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,880
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

380
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,120
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

381
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,440
We should not be unkind, of course, but

382
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,920
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

383
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,320
Is a very common thing

384
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,080
that people indulge more into so-called curing

385
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,800
and improving and this. It's all right.

386
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,360
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

387
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,800
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

388
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,400
It's all right. Finish them.

389
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,520
If they don't want to live together, let them.

390
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,960
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

391
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,920
many people who are healthy in this world.

392
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,440
Now how can you go on struggling with people

393
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,480
who don't want to live together and have problems?

394
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,760
That's not your job.

395
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,000
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

396
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,320
You are not a social worker.

397
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,040
Of course,

398
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,560
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

399
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,320
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

400
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,760
With that, the greatest disease

401
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,600
is of meanness, of cruelty,

402
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,720
of torturing others, anger.

403
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,400
All these diseases can be cured,

404
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,600
which are internal, not external.

405
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,320
That is today wanted.

406
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Every country's fighting and is tortured

407
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,800
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

408
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,080
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

409
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,840
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

410
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,080
that when you give Realisation to someone

411
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,760
and he values it, and he grows into it,

412
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,440
then you are protected.

413
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,440
You are completely protected.

414
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,800
Who protects you, you may say?

415
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,880
The Adi Shakti, all right,

416
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,680
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

417
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:23,520
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

418
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:35,600
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

419
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,640
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

420
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,480
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

421
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:51,960
and if He finds something really very wrong,

422
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,720
I cannot control it.

423
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,480
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

424
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
He destroys.

425
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,160
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

426
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,760
Anywhere there is a calamity,

427
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,920
we can say, like an earthquake

428
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,600
or some sort of a hurricane,

429
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,600
all these things come

430
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,640
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

431
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
I can't help you there,

432
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,080
but if you really give Realisation to people,

433
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,440
all these can be averted.

434
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,400
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

435
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,960
that She started this work of creating this world,

436
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,280
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

437
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,800
but your responsibility is also very important.

438
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,680
You cannot be responsible.

439
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:40,400
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

440
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,600
I never felt it was My responsibility,

441
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,560
never felt this was My job,

442
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,800
never felt I have to do it.

443
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
'I did it.'

444
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,760
That is the work.

445
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,200
That's the kind of personality you should have.

446
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,240
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

447
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,880
in a very beautiful manner

448
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,200
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

449
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:31,880
how you are supported and how everything works out.

450
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,760
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

451
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,000
you can give Realisation to people.

452
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,240
You can change their lives.

453
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,240
Never you would feel such joy,

454
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:55,360
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

455
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,800
a big job or a big name

456
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:06,400
or a very big award, no.

457
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,560
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

458
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,240
knows no bounds,

459
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,720
is such a joy-giving thing.

460
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,800
You develop such fraternities,

461
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,000
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

462
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,240
such enjoyment of love,

463
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,880
enjoyment of compassion.

464
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,840
It's a different level of enjoyment

465
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,080
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

466
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,800
You're not to be afraid of Me,

467
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,200
but be afraid of yourself.

468
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,080
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

469
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,800
what have you been doing so far.

470
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,200
What have you done so far?

471
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:19,680
Because you have been enlightened.

472
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,400
If the enlightened people

473
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,400
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

474
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,320
Look at these little, little candles.

475
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,240
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

476
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,360
They're burning themselves to give that light.

477
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:46,600
If we cannot give that light,

478
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,160
what is the use of enlightenment?

479
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,040
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

480
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,080
the light of love, compassion,

481
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,960
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

482
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,880
as you see in the films.

483
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,400
It is a divine love which works

484
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,640
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

485
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,200
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

486
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,920
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

487
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,640
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

488
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,560
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

489
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,680
After getting the highest,

490
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:51,680
why do you want to go so low as that?

491
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,520
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

492
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,320
You have not realised what you have got.

493
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,200
And you don't respect yourself.

494
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:16,560
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

495
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:27,440
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

496
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,520
We have to work it out.

497
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,160
Single-handed, I've done it,

498
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,920
worked very hard, I must say,

499
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:46,240
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

500
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,960
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

501
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,680
That doesn't matter.

502
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,120
And such beautiful birds I have discovered.

503
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,440
But you must keep your lustre

504
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,480
and work it out.

505
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:20,520
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

506
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,320
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

507
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,200
and that people are really

508
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:37,280
getting into that realm

509
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,720
of peace, joy and happiness.

510
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,680
That's My dream

511
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,800
and I hope you all will all work it out.

512
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,920
Thank you very much.
