1
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:51,029
Now we are facing little children.

2
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:58,898
They are the ones who are incarnations.

3
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:06,501
They are the ones who are going
to lead humanity

4
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:15,661
into some great advancement –

5
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:21,620
the humanity has to be looked after.

6
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:27,994
They are tomorrow’s humanity.
And we are today’s.

7
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:34,683
And what are we giving to them
for them to follow?

8
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:39,881
What is their aim in life?

9
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,660
Very, very difficult to say.

10
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:53,483
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will
all go in the proper way,

11
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,746
 they’ll behave in a proper way

12
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:05,597
and the whole thing will be a different
mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

13
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:12,044
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis
to look after them;

14
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:17,554
to have better moral standards,
to have better lives

15
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:27,510
so that they follow your life and become
genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

16
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:35,713
It’s a very big responsibility, perhaps
we don’t recognise it, we don’t understand,

17
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:47,302
but all these are little creatures
which are after the image

18
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:55,050
of great souls and they should be
brought up in that way,

19
00:04:55,251 --> 00:05:03,065
respected in that manner and loved
with great care.

20
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:11,046
This is to be understood. The problem
with our elderly people is this,

21
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:16,944
that we do not consider them
to be considered,

22
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:24,304
to be bothered about, to be understood
about. We think we are too intelligent,

23
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:29,541
too good and we need not waste
our energy with them.

24
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:33,441
This is the trouble of the elderly
people.

25
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:41,101
But today when we are sitting here
to worship Shri Ganesha,

26
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:45,583
we should know they are all incarnations
of Shri Ganesha

27
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:54,474
and they should be given proper attention,
proper understanding about themselves.

28
00:05:54,675 --> 00:06:04,413
I find certain amount of children who are
very well-behaved, which are very sensible,

29
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:10,501
and there are some who have no idea
as to what they are doing.

30
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:16,907
So it is the duty of the elders to put
ideas into their head,

31
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:22,939
to proper understanding about themselves
and the self-respect.

32
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:29,632
Same thing I would say for the elder
Sahaja Yogis

33
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:34,551
who have to look after their younger
brothers and sisters.

34
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,589
In this family of ours which we call
as Sahaja Yogis,

35
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:47,084
there are all kinds of people, all types,
all behaviours.

36
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:54,552
Of course, they should not be regimented,
there should not be uniformity,

37
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:58,270
but in that variety there should be
with beauty,

38
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,999
there should be beautiful trend of being
one with each other.

39
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,774
For that, what should we do,
is the problem.

40
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:15,455
What should the elders do to achieve that?

41
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:23,740
What is our solid contribution
to their lives?

42
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:35,731
The first will be to tell them who is
Shri Ganesha,

43
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:44,110
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,
what does He represent.

44
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:50,076
What does He represent, what qualities
He has.

45
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:56,314
And once they start understanding, that
though being a little boy,

46
00:07:56,515 --> 00:08:03,194
He’s so generous, He’s so kind,
He’s so forgiving,

47
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:08,572
they’ll be amazed because they are
also small

48
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:14,231
and they’ll also take to that kind of life.

49
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:20,575
I find some children very sensible,
very good here.

50
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:26,823
Some are naughty and some don’t understand
what we are doing here.

51
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:31,526
Whatever it is, they are after all
children.

52
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:38,037
And what you have to do is to look
after them, respect them,

53
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:46,529
and give them the full idea about
Shri Ganesha.

54
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:54,453
I think everybody must have a statue
of Shri Ganesha in your house,

55
00:08:54,653 --> 00:09:00,207
so the children will see it and ask,
“Who is He? What is He doing here?”

56
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:04,427
And you’ll be amazed how they will
understand Him,

57
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:10,270
how they will understand His qualities
and how they will work it out.

58
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:17,752
It is important for all of you to have
at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

59
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:24,203
so that you can tell your children that,
‘You all have to become like Him’.

60
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:28,913
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha?

61
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:33,263
They won’t understand chastity,
they are too small,

62
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:36,929
they won’t understand all those qualities.

63
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:46,718
But one quality they will understand
is to be honest. Is to be honest.

64
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:14,923
Gradually you’ll find all difficult ones
will go down, it will work out that way.

65
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:20,763
Because you see, they don’t understand
My lecture,

66
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:23,996
they don’t understand what I am saying.

67
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:31,933
But one thing is there, if there are some
oppositions within, they will show –

68
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:38,218
show very well – because they are
so innocent and so simple,

69
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:46,648
their innocence will help them to expose
them to reality.

70
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:53,477
I hope you all look after your children,
guide them properly

71
00:10:53,678 --> 00:11:06,570
and take them to a level of understanding
that they understand what is their position,

72
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:12,228
what qualities they should have,
why will they be respected.

73
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:18,995
You’ll be amazed, that their behaviour
will change

74
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:23,607
the behaviour of all the other children.

75
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,812
What I have to say that nobody should think
that you are very grown-up

76
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:37,223
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly
and all that, no.

77
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:44,380
You are grown-up only if you can imbibe
the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

78
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:51,331
I have seen people who are very grown-up
still do not have simple qualities

79
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:56,702
of chastity, of honesty.

80
00:11:56,903 --> 00:12:04,035
They don’t have, and they can’t have,
because they don’t think it is important.

81
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:12,767
So, I leave it to you to find out
Shri Ganesha within yourself.

82
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:21,194
I enjoy their company because
they are so innocent

83
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:29,935
and so simple-hearted and I like them
very, very much.

84
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:46,402
So, you should not get afraid or frightened
of their mischief.

85
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:52,243
On the contrary, you should know
they deserve much more love,

86
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:59,339
much more understanding and much more
scope to grow.

87
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,893
I hope by the time they will be of your age,
they’ll be great Sahaja Yogis.

88
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:09,312
They’ll understand what we are doing here.

89
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:16,899
I had to face mountains of nonsense
with the older people,

90
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,973
but these won’t have that. They’ll be
very simple, very sweet

91
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:27,910
and they’ll understand love.

92
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:33,524
So I would say we can allow these children
to go out and play

93
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:39,786
and somebody can look after them,
so that you’ll be at peace.

94
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:48,033
Who can take them out?

95
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:18,850
You can give Me flowers. If you have got
flowers, I’ll take them.

96
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:30,127
Thank you.

97
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:34,658
Thank you very much.

98
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:41,098
What is it? Boy: Chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate.

99
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,925
Boy: Yes, chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate. Chocolate, Shri Mataji.

100
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:47,860
Thank you. Thank you very much.

101
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:56,201
Thank you.

102
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,262
Thank you.

103
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,058
Thank you.

104
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,300
Avinash: Can we have some volunteers?
Please, take the children out.

105
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,551
Shri Mataji would like the children
to play outside.

106
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:07,455
Can we have some mothers, some aunties
if they can please take them out?

107
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,602
So we can proceed, please.

108
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,686
Any volunteers, anyone?

109
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:19,750
If Yuva Shakti... You'll get as much
vibrations, please.
