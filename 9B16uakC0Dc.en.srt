1
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:29,962
Today is a great day for all of us,

2
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,842
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

3
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:47,562
That in sixteen beats

4
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:53,282
or sixteen movements

5
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:58,242
you reach a higher position in the coil.

6
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,362
That it is complete,

7
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:26,922
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

8
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:35,322
because He has sixteen petals.

9
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,642
This completeness is called as "purna."

10
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:05,002
So, now we move into another dimension.

11
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:20,282
The first one was where you got your Self-realization.

12
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:31,682
In the evolutionary process,

13
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:38,842
if you see, the animals are not conscious

14
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:43,082
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

15
00:07:54,562 --> 00:08:01,242
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

16
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:05,322
for their own purpose.

17
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:17,962
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

18
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,762
If you show a mirror to animals

19
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:29,362
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

20
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,442
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

21
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,562
That means that we are rather close to them!

22
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:03,202
So, when we have become human beings,

23
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:08,042
we became aware in our consciousness

24
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:13,682
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

25
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:33,082
So, in their brain they did not understand

26
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:38,882
that they could put matter into their own use.

27
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:54,042
As human beings you were all unaware

28
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:59,682
of the chakras that existed within you.

29
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,242
So your consciousness still was working

30
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:17,002
halfway through unconscious

31
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:24,962
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

32
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:46,642
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

33
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:52,402
or your inner organs, how they're working.

34
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,162
You did not even feel how

35
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:10,522
you are getting affected by other influences.

36
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:25,882
As a result of that,

37
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:31,362
with the freedom that human beings achieved

38
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:33,882
or were granted,

39
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:38,082
they gathered all kinds of things

40
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,762
into their brains, into their Sahasrara,

41
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:45,922
without being aware of it.

42
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:10,122
They used their Sahasrara, their brain

43
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:17,922
for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless.

44
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:30,882
They were not aware, again,

45
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,722
of the warning that Shri Krishna had given

46
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:40,562
that if you use human awareness except for your ascent,

47
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:44,962
you will go downward.

48
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:09,402
They were told. Not that they were not told.

49
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,442
They knew about it.

50
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:22,362
Whether it was East or West, everybody knew

51
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:26,322
that you have to be born again.

52
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,842
And it so happened that in the West

53
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:46,322
people thought that by using their brainpower

54
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:51,082
they can now master the matter;

55
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:02,682
that they can use matter for their own purpose.

56
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:10,402
If they had done it after their Self-realization,

57
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:15,442
it would have been a very different situation,

58
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:27,082
because after Self-realization

59
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:31,842
you all have become aware of vibrations,

60
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:36,562
which is chaitanya, and also of your chakras.

61
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:49,002
With this new awareness,

62
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:53,802
you would have avoided all that was wrong.

63
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,522
But it is like a greedy person,

64
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:10,682
who gets a wee bit of money and he spends it off.

65
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:33,402
Now this problem has complicated your brains.

66
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:44,642
You have certain concepts, which are very much away from reality.

67
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:55,922
The way we have started using machines,

68
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:00,042
we have become machines ourselves.

69
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:12,322
So we have no feelings and we cannot relate

70
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:16,762
to others in a natural way.

71
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:29,762
In human awareness you had achieved

72
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:36,522
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

73
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:50,322
But this ego-oriented approach

74
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:58,442
took you away from natural, real life.

75
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:10,442
And we became artificial.

76
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:21,282
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

77
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:39,162
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

78
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:50,682
This is just the opposite of your ascent

79
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,642
and evolutionary process

80
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:04,282
because you have lost the power to relate to others,

81
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:08,362
which you had gained as human beings.

82
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:21,042
All the organizations which you have formed

83
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:28,543
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

84
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:42,642
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

85
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:56,388
That is another copying of the artificial.

86
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:05,868
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

87
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,948
Natural is to evolve.

88
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:20,348
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

89
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:26,508
So the another concept also that you accepted very easily

90
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,828
because you have got brains

91
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:33,548
and you accept everything that comes your way.

92
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:48,548
And you became so artificial that you needed all the time

93
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:52,548
some sensations to feel yourself.

94
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,299
Now in every walk of life [missing part, 20 seconds]

95
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:22,796
But that also you made so artificial

96
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:26,996
that you have now your sex in your brain.

97
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:41,596
By that not only you have silenced Ganesha in the Mooladhara,

98
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:45,756
but also Mahaganesha in your brain.

99
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,596
In another aspect, say art.

100
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:05,036
Now the concept is so stupid

101
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:14,076
that it says that art should be according to what is laid down.

102
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,156
Whatever is laid down about art,

103
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:23,556
that art should be such, such, such.

104
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:37,996
Like you will call somebody as baroque, condemn it,

105
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:43,436
then rococo, this, that. Condemn everyone.

106
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,996
And ultimately you reach a conclusion

107
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:57,316
that the most insipid thing is art.

108
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:09,316
As if, like the sugarcane, when you have taken out all the juice,

109
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:13,636
whatever remains will become art one day.

110
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:29,196
So the brain, which does not nourish the heart

111
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:35,756
is absolutely an artificial brain, just like a robot.

112
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:47,316
So people have become just like robots.

113
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,556
Now this can be handled by anyone

114
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:58,156
who has a mastermind.

115
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:04,916
Because you don't have your own heart

116
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:09,036
and the brain is controlled by somebody

117
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:13,956
who has a greater brain of concepts.

118
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:29,156
All these concepts are destructive.

119
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:57,316
Say Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan

120
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:01,676
and he is of the superior race.

121
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:11,996
And to establish that, he did not mind

122
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:14,356
destroying the whole world.

123
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:29,516
Same is the case in the religion field.

124
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:42,596
There also, every religion was put

125
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:48,916
or poured into the cups of concepts.

126
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:04,436
Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved,

127
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,836
is that money is everything.

128
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:22,516
First they tried for political domination,

129
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:28,436
thinking that political domination is everything.

130
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:39,796
And now they feel that money is everything

131
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:46,036
and all other sublime things are imaginary.

132
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:11,676
So, when I started My life,

133
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:17,516
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

134
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:33,396
And the more I tried to solve the complications

135
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:38,836
within My own awareness,

136
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:45,676
the more it became more difficult.

137
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:06,796
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

138
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:14,356
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

139
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:31,356
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

140
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,716
within these sixteen years

141
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:39,756
I found that they are now incorrigible.

142
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:07,476
Now the stage for you is laid down

143
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:10,876
to ascend higher.

144
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:24,516
This is the background which I have described to you.

145
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:33,036
And you can see how, when you have a program,

146
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:37,276
there will be 500 people for the program

147
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:41,996
and within two weeks all will disappear.

148
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,916
Because when the ascent takes place,

149
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:59,396
the Kundalini pushes out the ego

150
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:04,916
and brings the person close to reality.

151
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:19,556
But again that ego, which is being built up so fast

152
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,276
in its speed, overpowers the speed

153
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:27,676
of the Kundalini and covers the head.

154
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:54,676
Then it suggests that, "how can you have godly life?"

155
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:00,996
You will miss all the alcohol, all the madness,

156
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:04,356
all the fun of life.

157
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:14,796
That they feel, they will lose all the freedom to become mad.

158
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:24,356
When you see from this position

159
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:29,476
the way people react, it is amazing.

160
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:45,076
You have to do something extremely stupid

161
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,436
to sell it in the market.

162
00:30:55,916 --> 00:31:02,156
The other day I heard that somebody has become rich

163
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:11,156
selling the empty tins as lamps.

164
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,836
All kinds of stupid things,

165
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:29,716
which are nowhere near natural beauty

166
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:36,236
or natural joy, are accepted as sophisticated.

167
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:53,196
The other side of it is that the asuri vidya,

168
00:31:53,356 --> 00:32:00,396
the black vidya has taken over.

169
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,756
As Shri Krishna again had warned that,

170
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:25,036
in the fifteenth chapter, that if asuri vidya takes over,

171
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:28,276
then the suddha vidya cannot compete

172
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:32,476
with the speed of asuri vidya.

173
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,156
Like in America there has been a big

174
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,356
argument amongst Sahaja Yogis

175
00:32:55,579 --> 00:33:01,099
if My photograph should be in the drawing room or not.

176
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:17,422
But if you ask them to paint their nails black,

177
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:22,452
their faces black and black clothes like witches, they will do it.

178
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:37,212
That even at the stage when we are Sahaja Yogis,

179
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:43,292
we are shy of our godly life.

180
00:33:51,452 --> 00:33:54,972
When they became hippies or when they became punks

181
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:58,612
or they became anything like that stupid,

182
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:00,092
they gave all their life,

183
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,612
all their time, all their money to it.

184
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:12,212
They changed their dresses, they changed their lifestyles,

185
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:18,132
they changed their family life, everything they changed, went all out.

186
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:27,492
I mean, and even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about

187
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:33,772
the godliness of Sahaja Yoga, still they are shy.

188
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,294
Now you know your Mother doesn't take any money from you,

189
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:50,503
on the contrary She spends, you all have gained out of it.

190
00:34:50,528 --> 00:34:55,688
But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy.

191
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:23,128
From that background you are coming to the light of God's grace.

192
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:34,488
But you don't want to dash at it,

193
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:39,048
you want to take your time, gradually,

194
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:45,728
so gradually that maybe you may lose your chance.

195
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:58,928
So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis

196
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:02,448
where you know all about your chakras,

197
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:08,328
you know about vibrations, you know how you relate to others,

198
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:16,288
still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

199
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:32,608
So, the shadow of the past still lingers on,

200
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:38,368
even when you have this new awareness.

201
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:49,888
Animals can swim automatically,

202
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,848
they don't have to learn.

203
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:55,928
But human beings have to learn to swim.

204
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:04,848
So they had forgotten the techniques which were known to the animals

205
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:09,968
and have taken to the techniques of human beings.

206
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,968
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got

207
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:23,008
your realization in one lifetime.

208
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:32,368
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

209
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:40,888
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

210
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:48,208
So the time is so very short!

211
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:52,608
And the background is so dark.

212
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,888
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

213
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:01,648
morning till evening destructive concepts.

214
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:10,448
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

215
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:14,008
much faster than all of them.

216
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:24,008
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

217
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:29,048
that your awareness is very different from them,

218
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:33,888
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

219
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:38,008
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

220
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:59,808
Every one of you must think every day:

221
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:04,808
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

222
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,572
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

223
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,412
of making money, of have relations with people

224
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:24,212
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:42,612
We have to make an all out effort

226
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:46,612
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,

227
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:49,652
we believe in, we act on that

228
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:53,212
and become one with it.

229
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:12,012
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

230
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:19,572
this is the problem, I mean ... I'll explain this point.

231
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:32,212
Like supposing a fanatic believes

232
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:36,732
that he can do such and such thing

233
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:41,132
in his own religion, he will do it.

234
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:04,013
When the concept is not reality,

235
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:07,213
it has given no benefit to anyone,

236
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:13,093
has shown no performance of any substance

237
00:41:13,293 --> 00:41:16,013
still people do it.

238
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:37,373
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

239
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,333
My father himself gave up all his property,

240
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:47,693
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

241
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:52,613
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

242
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:56,853
for days together, for years together.

243
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:21,493
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

244
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:23,813
but for the subtler freedom

245
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:28,773
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

246
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:33,762
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

247
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:39,402
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

248
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:56,171
You are the ones who are very much higher

249
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:59,931
than the rest of the humanity.

250
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:13,571
That the salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you.

251
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:23,891
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

252
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:32,891
So, first of all you have to be conscious

253
00:43:33,091 --> 00:43:37,451
in your consciousness that you are so important,

254
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:41,811
and that's why you were given realization.

255
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:52,891
How can you be living with your conditionings

256
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:56,331
and with your ego?

257
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,091
The conditionings are like this:

258
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:08,091
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

259
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,291
then you must bring that

260
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,371
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:15,451
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

262
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,571
you want to bring some out of that.

263
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:33,611
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

264
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:39,171
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

265
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:57,691
All these things are like dirt over

266
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:02,411
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

267
00:45:16,971 --> 00:45:19,291
Though now you are aware,

268
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:24,371
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

269
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:28,131
you do not keep them clean.

270
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:40,211
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

271
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:44,131
they have houses, they try to keep it clean.

272
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,371
But you do not feel ashamed

273
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:54,731
of them also when they are bad,

274
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:57,531
because after some time

275
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:01,131
you also lose the awareness of them.

276
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:15,531
That means you have become subtler,

277
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:22,291
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

278
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:42,211
There are so many things you know more

279
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:47,451
than the people who are not realized,

280
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:51,571
as absolute reality.

281
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:06,691
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

282
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:14,371
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

283
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:20,371
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

284
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,771
we start giving bandhans.

285
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:36,651
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

286
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,611
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

287
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:47,291
otherwise, in your central nervous system

288
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:51,051
you are not yet so conscious.

289
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:09,211
This is the reason, why you do not know

290
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:17,091
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

291
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:37,371
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

292
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:40,891
you cannot go further.

293
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:55,811
For example, I know everything what I do.

294
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:05,491
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

295
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:13,611
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

296
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:18,651
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

297
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:28,611
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

298
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:32,131
I know about everyone of you.

299
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:42,491
I may not know your worldly names,

300
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:47,891
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

301
00:49:57,331 --> 00:50:03,411
I also can behave like a human being,

302
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:10,291
absolutely like you, aging like you,

303
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:16,331
even using spectacles,

304
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:25,331
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

305
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:35,731
I have accepted this role consciously,

306
00:50:36,731 --> 00:50:39,131
not unconsciously.

307
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:42,731
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

308
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:50,171
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

309
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,211
you have to be alert about it.

310
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:11,131
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

311
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:13,251
the peace.

312
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:19,651
But even now I find that peace

313
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:24,331
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

314
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:39,731
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

315
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:46,771
It is a homogeneous thing.

316
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:51,131
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

317
00:51:57,611 --> 00:52:00,851
We are unconscious about our fingers,

318
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:03,146
but when we have to hold something,

319
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:07,531
all of them come together and work it out.

320
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:22,331
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

321
00:52:22,531 --> 00:52:27,571
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

322
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:31,571
That is what evolution is.

323
00:52:52,411 --> 00:53:03,434
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

324
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:19,131
You must learn to face the reality,

325
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:26,291
to accept the reality and act a real way.

326
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,290
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

327
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:45,770
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

328
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,450
Maybe for the human beings,

329
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,850
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

330
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,770
but not for Me

331
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,770
'cause I know what it is.

332
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:15,170
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

333
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:22,850
one has to see how you are working it out.

334
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:45,610
The whole system of relating to

335
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,370
each other must change completely.

336
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:07,090
That is very important, at least for western people.

337
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:11,770
Because at least in India people know

338
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,730
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

339
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,850
you have to take to your ascent -

340
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,930
I mean the real Indians.

341
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,210
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

342
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,730
and then disappear, some of them do.

343
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,930
But mostly they know that you have to be

344
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,450
conscious of what you have got.

345
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:20,810
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

346
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,450
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

347
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,450
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

348
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:46,698
say of some great saint.

349
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,458
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

350
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:55,658
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

351
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,938
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

352
00:57:06,138 --> 00:57:10,458
If your names are taken, why not the vibrations flow?

353
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:26,938
And in this you have greater advantages

354
00:57:27,138 --> 00:57:30,058
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

355
00:57:30,298 --> 00:57:34,978
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

356
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:47,538
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

357
00:58:05,618 --> 00:58:09,578
Sometimes French is small, sometimes so big.

358
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:19,898
Now, in expression, when we say something,

359
00:58:20,058 --> 00:58:22,938
when we express; are we natural,

360
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:26,458
are we it doing from our heart?

361
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:40,818
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

362
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,418
is what I want you to achieve.

363
00:58:56,138 --> 00:58:59,898
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

364
00:59:00,098 --> 00:59:03,698
others will just take it for granted.

365
00:59:09,698 --> 00:59:12,938
They do not want to help.

366
00:59:14,138 --> 00:59:17,618
They want everything to be ready-made.

367
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:21,698
That shows that they are not conscious

368
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:26,058
of their own powers of enjoyment.

369
00:59:34,218 --> 00:59:36,658
If they do it from their heart,

370
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:44,298
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

371
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:48,858
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

372
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:52,018
or what they have achieved.

373
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:16,178
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

374
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:20,778
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

375
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,858
Now the second stage would be

376
01:00:34,058 --> 01:00:39,858
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

377
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:54,738
where there will be no mistakes.

378
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:56,818
Whatever you will do

379
01:00:57,018 --> 01:01:01,538
may appear to be a mistake, will turn out to be all right.

380
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,770
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

381
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:15,883
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

382
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:19,243
they think I'm saying it to them.

383
01:01:31,283 --> 01:01:35,363
Now for example, today I had My watch,

384
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:39,723
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

385
01:01:39,883 --> 01:01:42,563
say, simple thing.

386
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:51,443
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

387
01:01:51,643 --> 01:01:55,003
but quite consciously.

388
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:03,603
Because watch stopped and I knew the time,

389
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:06,763
what time I have to be there for puja.

390
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:19,403
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

391
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:37,043
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

392
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:44,203
But that was not the time I had to come.

393
01:02:48,283 --> 01:02:54,083
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

394
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:05,723
So whatever mischief you play,

395
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:10,003
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

396
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:19,883
And then you can make a drama.

397
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:25,443
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

398
01:03:31,723 --> 01:03:36,043
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

399
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:43,163
Just now the stage at which we are,

400
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:45,923
we are still making lots of mistakes

401
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:50,643
because we are not Self-conscious.

402
01:04:03,003 --> 01:04:04,963
In a gross way we understand

403
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:07,003
this word self-consciousness like this:

404
01:04:07,203 --> 01:04:09,243
When a person has to go for an interview

405
01:04:09,443 --> 01:04:11,323
then, he selects his suit properly,

406
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:13,643
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

407
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:18,523
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

408
01:04:28,403 --> 01:04:31,283
But when it is the question of your ascent,

409
01:04:31,483 --> 01:04:35,043
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

410
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:38,403
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

411
01:04:38,603 --> 01:04:42,163
put us in the cradle and take us there.

412
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:46,332
This is being childish!

413
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:57,172
You have to mature in your ascent.

414
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:07,532
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

415
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:13,452
Face yourself every day!

416
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:21,572
In reality, see how much time you spend about

417
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:27,612
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

418
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:52,532
Have you left everything, all your worries

419
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:56,212
to God Almighty?

420
01:06:00,932 --> 01:06:06,972
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

421
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:18,972
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

422
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:33,532
And how do I relate to others?

423
01:06:33,732 --> 01:06:39,772
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

424
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:51,052
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

425
01:06:51,252 --> 01:06:54,532
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

426
01:06:54,732 --> 01:07:01,492
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

427
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:21,372
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

428
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:25,092
pays more attention to the negative people

429
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,652
than to the positive.

430
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:45,452
He relates better to the people who are negative

431
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:48,332
than to the people who are positive.

432
01:07:51,532 --> 01:07:55,012
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

433
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:57,932
than with the positive.

434
01:08:04,156 --> 01:08:08,316
You have to cling on to the positive.

435
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:17,596
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

436
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:27,356
All these subtle understandings

437
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:30,636
I have told you many a times.

438
01:08:38,876 --> 01:08:43,516
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

439
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:46,676
like a spoiled computer,

440
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:49,436
you can reach some conclusions

441
01:08:49,636 --> 01:08:54,596
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

442
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:13,876
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

443
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:16,316
A simple thing.

444
01:09:17,076 --> 01:09:22,996
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

445
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:27,836
That is as if you should not understand

446
01:09:28,036 --> 01:09:31,076
why you're behaving like this?

447
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:42,076
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

448
01:09:47,236 --> 01:09:53,756
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

449
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,836
which has got love in it,

450
01:09:58,036 --> 01:10:03,396
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

451
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:18,596
This complicated brain is to be put right,

452
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:26,436
and the best way is to stop thinking.

453
01:10:27,796 --> 01:10:31,396
Just stop thinking.

454
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:36,916
That's what you have to do.

455
01:10:40,396 --> 01:10:47,796
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

456
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:59,796
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

457
01:11:01,516 --> 01:11:06,156
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

458
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:11,836
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

459
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:15,836
Can you hear My thinking?

460
01:11:21,396 --> 01:11:26,516
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

461
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:29,156
Then you just start thinking about it,

462
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:32,236
"I have to enlighten."

463
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:40,116
Will it get enlightened?

464
01:11:41,276 --> 01:11:48,716
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do it.

465
01:11:55,796 --> 01:11:59,636
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

466
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:09,876
and is used to avoid work.

467
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:16,156
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

468
01:12:16,356 --> 01:12:22,116
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

469
01:12:22,316 --> 01:12:26,276
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

470
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:35,996
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

471
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:43,076
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

472
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:48,796
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

473
01:12:51,356 --> 01:12:54,316
She was a western lady.

474
01:12:56,196 --> 01:13:01,516
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

475
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:04,756
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

476
01:13:04,956 --> 01:13:10,076
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

477
01:13:19,636 --> 01:13:24,116
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

478
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:27,316
the cleverness.

479
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:43,156
So you do not argue about it.

480
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:47,036
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

481
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,836
You do not argue with your leaders.

482
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:59,756
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

483
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:04,636
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

484
01:14:04,796 --> 01:14:09,596
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

485
01:14:09,796 --> 01:14:12,396
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

486
01:14:12,636 --> 01:14:16,396
they have nothing to do with that.

487
01:14:27,156 --> 01:14:28,916
Supposing you are working in an office

488
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:31,836
and the husband is some great official

489
01:14:32,036 --> 01:14:37,036
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

490
01:14:48,476 --> 01:14:54,916
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

491
01:14:55,076 --> 01:15:00,996
nourish the husband with love

492
01:15:08,516 --> 01:15:12,756
from their heart and not from their brains.

493
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:26,836
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

494
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:33,516
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

495
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:49,836
The emotions of My love,

496
01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:56,076
the working and the play of My love.

497
01:16:01,316 --> 01:16:03,636
It's so great

498
01:16:03,836 --> 01:16:09,516
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

499
01:16:15,716 --> 01:16:18,156
So the women should not feel degraded

500
01:16:18,316 --> 01:16:21,596
if they have to look after the heart,

501
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:36,956
but they are in a higher, in a way,

502
01:16:37,116 --> 01:16:40,676
in a higher aspect.

503
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:48,916
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

504
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:56,916
So the ladies should not argue

505
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:03,316
with their husbands if they are leaders,

506
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:10,996
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

507
01:17:16,196 --> 01:17:19,836
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

508
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:22,196
the men become deaf.

509
01:17:22,396 --> 01:17:27,676
They just don't listen what women are talking.

510
01:17:37,836 --> 01:17:40,396
If they are very aggressive, then the men

511
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:45,396
become absolutely shut up.

512
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:56,236
So in relationship with each other,

513
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:58,756
you must behave in a natural way

514
01:17:58,956 --> 01:18:03,876
that you are a man and you are a woman.

515
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:14,476
You should become more a woman and more a man

516
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:22,116
and then you will see the fun.

517
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:25,956
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

518
01:18:26,156 --> 01:18:28,676
what would have happened?

519
01:18:39,396 --> 01:18:44,836
So we have to know that in our awareness

520
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:50,196
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

521
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:59,596
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

522
01:19:07,436 --> 01:19:14,636
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

523
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:21,716
that is of Sahasrara.

524
01:19:22,876 --> 01:19:30,076
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

525
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:43,716
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

526
01:19:48,516 --> 01:19:56,196
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

527
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:03,876
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

528
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:10,156
according to the Deity, surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

529
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:21,116
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

530
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:25,916
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

531
01:20:34,436 --> 01:20:40,236
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

532
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:47,996
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

533
01:21:00,036 --> 01:21:12,036
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

534
01:21:19,236 --> 01:21:24,356
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

535
01:21:29,996 --> 01:21:33,676
And it's so, so simple for you,

536
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:38,276
because you have the Deity,

537
01:21:38,516 --> 01:21:42,956
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

538
01:21:43,116 --> 01:21:47,316
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

539
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:50,356
have seen that Deity.

540
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:11,476
They say that you have to ask for three things

541
01:22:11,716 --> 01:22:15,196
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

542
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:20,676
meaning to see God, salokya;

543
01:22:20,876 --> 01:22:23,836
samipya, the closeness with God

544
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:29,236
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

545
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:44,236
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with Me

546
01:22:50,836 --> 01:22:53,996
which is not in the concept of any one

547
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:59,076
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

548
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:11,996
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

549
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,436
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

550
01:23:22,676 --> 01:23:25,236
they are no more.

551
01:23:42,196 --> 01:23:49,996
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

552
01:23:54,716 --> 01:23:58,916
You must understand your greatness

553
01:24:02,076 --> 01:24:07,116
and you must understand how you people

554
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:15,756
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

555
01:24:24,756 --> 01:24:28,836
So now there's no time for lethargy.

556
01:24:31,396 --> 01:24:36,796
Now you have to rise and awake.

557
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:46,236
Today is the day when I hope

558
01:24:46,436 --> 01:24:50,671
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

559
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:03,107
But only by effort you will stay there,

560
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:06,701
otherwise you'll again slip down.

561
01:25:16,141 --> 01:25:18,661
So go through this lecture again and again,

562
01:25:18,861 --> 01:25:21,541
and do not think about it.

563
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:38,621
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

564
01:25:40,381 --> 01:25:42,541
For all of you,

565
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:45,141
each of you,

566
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,301
and you must know yourself

567
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:52,861
how far you are going every day.

568
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:07,541
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

569
01:26:09,901 --> 01:26:14,581
Actually, if you see, it is according

570
01:26:14,781 --> 01:26:18,541
to the sun calendar,

571
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:22,941
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

572
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:31,901
It's a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

573
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:40,381
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

574
01:26:43,941 --> 01:26:50,701
So one has to know that the calendar of God

575
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:55,194
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

576
01:27:04,241 --> 01:27:06,441
and some think I should have come

577
01:27:06,641 --> 01:27:10,761
at least two thousand years back,

578
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:17,401
in this form.

579
01:27:18,121 --> 01:27:24,401
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

580
01:27:24,601 --> 01:27:28,281
everything is all right.

581
01:27:33,161 --> 01:27:38,441
You are not robots, you are not machines,

582
01:27:40,441 --> 01:27:47,161
you are evolved through evolutionary process.

583
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:53,361
And through evolutionary process only

584
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:57,961
you have to achieve the higher personality.

585
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:11,561
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

586
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:17,681
it's you who have to show the results.

587
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:37,241
We may take your Sahasrara

588
01:28:37,441 --> 01:28:43,121
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

589
01:28:52,081 --> 01:28:59,121
So you have to know that whatever heights

590
01:28:59,321 --> 01:29:04,321
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

591
01:29:04,521 --> 01:29:08,681
with full will power and action.

592
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:30,681
May God bless you!

593
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:36,561
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

594
01:29:36,761 --> 01:29:42,081
Do not take it as anything ill.

595
01:29:55,481 --> 01:29:58,361
I could not have said this even two years back

596
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:02,481
or one year back, because you are at the stage

597
01:30:02,681 --> 01:30:06,161
where I can say these things to you.

598
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:16,281
You can understand it, but

599
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:19,641
it has to become your consciousness.

600
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:31,521
The stage has reached to understand,

601
01:30:31,721 --> 01:30:34,801
but it should become your consciousness.

602
01:30:35,001 --> 01:30:39,921
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

603
01:30:49,721 --> 01:30:53,601
So, again, may God bless you!
