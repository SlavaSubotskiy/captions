1
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,920
...to organize.

2
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,400
Yes, but

3
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I praise Indians very much and I also praise with you.

4
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,640
But we have certain very bad qualities, and one of them is

5
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,480
that we are very extremely untidy people.

6
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,600
Our aesthetics are so horribly made

7
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,079

8
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,400
that we don't understand the difference between a plastic bag

9
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
and a silver jug,

10
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,880
such jumbled up things we have.

11
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,680
And I think I would request you to

12
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,840
insist on arranging things yourself,

13
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,440
because then they will pick up and learn things that it is to be done.

14
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
You have to learn a lot of things from them,

15
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
but they have to also learn some things from you,

16
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,600
and they are very important things.

17
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,480
Because it all makes a coefficients, it makes an atmosphere,

18
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,080
and a pleasing thing for the Gods.

19
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,960
But this is the character of an Indian, Indian character,

20
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,760
that whatever is wrong, wherever, whatever is the condition, carry on.

21
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
See no evil.

22
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,400
Speak no evil.  It's like that.

23
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
If anything is bad, let it be as it is.

24
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,040
Let it rust, let it - absolutely till it becomes so rotten,

25
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
that it is going to fall on your head,

26
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,000
then you may put a little support.

27
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
That's our character.

28
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,840
We're too tolerant with everything,

29
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,320
and that has led us to this kind of a

30
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,640
incapacity to work.

31
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,000
But if you see the ritambhara pragya, see the ritambhara pragya,

32
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,200
how she works,

33
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
how she beautifully does everything,

34
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,600
how she creates everything so beautifully.

35
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
There's so much neatness if you go to a jungle,

36
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,160
you will not find anything dirty, filthy, smelling - nothing.

37
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,440
Everything washed up, cleaned up.

38
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,080
The nature works in beautiful circles.

39
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,520
Everything works out so much beautifully,

40
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,720
that when we call ourselves "natural"

41
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,520
we should understand that ritambhara pragya is the most natural thing.

42
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,480
And how ritambhara pragya works is with complete neatness

43
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,920
and complete cleanliness of the whole thing.

44
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,240
Indians will be personally very, very clean,

45
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,240
extremely clean they are, no doubt.

46
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,160
But collectively they don't understand cleanliness.

47
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
If you see their roads, if you see their

48
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,680
outside of the houses, it's all dirty.

49
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,400
And that is what I will blame our Indian men,

50
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,800
you see, they are extremely

51
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
conscious that they are human beings.

52
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
You see, we have only two races in India:

53
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
Women and men.

54
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
There is no third race.

55
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,240
Men are not supposed to do any work, inside, outside, anywhere.

56
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,920
They don't see to the outside of the house.

57
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,480
Like in England I find men are

58
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,320
all the time doing the sweeping, swabbing, everything outside.

59
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
They do mowing of the lawn, looking after the garden, everything.

60
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Here the men will be just standing

61
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,880
with their hands on their waist

62
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,960
and ordering the wives, or if not the wife,

63
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,680
the servants and all that.

64
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
And whatever may be, the wife may be dominating

65
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,440
as far as money is concerned,

66
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,040
but all these things the man is not going to do.

67
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
He'll just give up.  He'll say:

68
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
"I am not supposed to do all these things."

69
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
That's why collectively in this country

70
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
we can never be clean people,

71
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,520
because our men will just sit down.

72
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,280
They won't do anything, just they won't do anything.

73
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
Only the women are supposed to do everything,

74
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,000
and that's how our collective cleanliness is zero, absolute zero.

75
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,520
For example, if there's a WC not working in England,

76
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,880
I can't think of any man who will sit down for five minutes.

77
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
He'll himself do it, he'll get a plumber,

78
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
he'll do somehow or other, try to manage.

79
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,200
Here, it's not all right - doesn't matter:

80
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
It's all right.

81
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,800
No, see no evil - manage.

82
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,640
This is how we have lived all centuries now I think,

83
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,840
and it's high time for all Sahaja yogis to change themselves.

84
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,520
Now, here there are many artists sitting in this part,

85
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
but the men are not doing anything - puja the women are doing.

86
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
And the women don't know anything how to do it,

87
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,600
so the whole thing can be absolutely wretched.

88
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,760
It is not, it is a sort of a

89
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,160
character with us, we do this way.

90
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,600
But otherwise we have so many qualities.

91
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,240
We have so many qualities, that

92
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,600
you can't imagine how much we have got through our traditions.

93
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,760
We are very humble people, we are

94
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
extremely loving, affectionate,

95
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,800
we'll go to any extent to serve others.

96
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,680
We are not cunning people, we are not meticulous, we don't calculate.

97
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,320
We are very hospitable.

98
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,200
All these things are there, no doubt.

99
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,240
But these things, that we have to learn from you,

100
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,120
it's maybe gross, to look at it looks gross, but it's not.

101
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Just now as you see that if it is properly done, if it is

102
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,240
nicely done, I mean, at least I feel very much pleased with it.

103
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,520
And everybody feels pleased about it.

104
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,520
And when somebody sees the film also, they'll be pleased to see

105
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,960
this find of a film where there's something sensibly

106
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,520
put up and everything is nicely done, care has been taken.

107
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,039
Also shows a kind of a understanding,

108
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
that this is the worship of the Adi Shakti,

109
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,520
and you cannot take liberties with it.

110
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,000
Imagine, in these ordinary temples

111
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,960
they spend so much money - even the walls, the doors,

112
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
the windows, everything made of silver.

113
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,320
They do so much to create that.

114
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,880
But if you people miss it - the Indians, I am saying -

115
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,440
then it's going to be very dangerous for you.

116
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,160
One must understand that you cannot just play about - just:

117
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,680
"Mother is coming"  -  Nobody came to even call Me.

118
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
Somebody should have come to call Me - I just walked on Myself.

119
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,840
Here, this is not the way to behave,

120
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,400
and the Indians must learn these things,

121
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,240
that somebody must come to call Me!

122
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,600
After all, you see,

123
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,040
all these protocols they are going to learn from you,

124
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
from the Indians;

125
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,640
and if you don't have any protocol about it,

126
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,880
how are they going to get it?

127
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
So this is what one has to understand,

128
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,440
that as English have to learn

129
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,000
from French and French have to learn from Germans,

130
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,320
and Germans have to learn from,

131
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
say, Austrians,

132
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,440
or Austrians have to learn from Swiss, whatever it is.

133
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,360
It's very important,

134
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,440
that the Indians must learn from the Western people.

135
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,880
Certain things, that the way they respect their women -

136
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,560
first of all that:

137
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,920
The way they respect their women.

138
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,560
Of course, one should not go to that limit

139
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,840
that the women just dominate, all the time.

140
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,000
I mean, American women are,

141
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,920
I have seen about women, they are horrible.

142
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,080
But still, I would say that one must learn,

143
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,480
must learn how to respect the women.

144
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,000
Women are human beings.

145
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,880
Your Mother is a woman,

146
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,040
and you must learn how to respect a woman.

147
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,800
And if you don't know how to respect the woman,

148
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
then in this country I'm sure

149
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,880
there cannot be bliss, whatever you may try.

150
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,120
So the men must learn that,

151
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
they must know how to talk to their sisters,

152
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,520
to their mothers, to their wives.

153
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,680
But if there's a woman who is dominating,

154
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
you see, if there's a dominating woman,

155
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,000
then she becomes a prime minister in this country.

156
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
That's what we are.

157
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,520
If you get a dominating woman then she can manage.

158
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,039
If she's a simple woman, she's good, she's religious,

159
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,360
she's submissive, then she's finished.

160
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,760
If she's dominating, then men are afraid of such women.

161
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,480
This is very sad and that gives a very bad images.

162
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,640
So I feel that as Ritambhara Pragya works out everything so well;

163
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,760
in the nature if you see how she beautifully creates everything,

164
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
how she chooses things, how she places things,

165
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
how the colors change.

166
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,400
You'll never find anything loud, anything obstructing,

167
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,240
anything that is destructive, vulgar, new - nothing.

168
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,920
Find everything so beautifully done,

169
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,440
that it creates an inspiration in a human mind,

170
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
in a human heart which can be of a stone also.

171
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Even French, you see, they get

172
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,680
inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

173
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,760
So you can imagine people with stone hearts

174
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,800
can get inspired,

175
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
people who have very funny ideas about human beings

176
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
can get inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

177
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,320
So why not

178
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,840
we, the Sahaja Yogis, should get inspiration

179
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,320
from Ritambhara Pragya,

180
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,720
and try to make everything look

181
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,080
nice, beautiful, and must have coefficients

182
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,160
by which we can have

183
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,680
the proper channel for our vibrations.

184
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,520
And this is what I feel is lacking

185
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
in the coordination between East and West.

186
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,920
Let us give them this simple thing

187
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,960
as to understand

188
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,800
how you respect your women,

189
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
how you respect the aesthetics,

190
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,480
how you look after things.

191
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,240
I know in London, supposing I have to have a Puja,

192
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,560
I don't want to see these things at all.

193
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,080
On the contrary, I am enamored the way things are done - always.

194
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
Here also they work out, I'm not saying always,

195
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,680
but it could have been much better little bit,

196
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
because a film has to be done and all that.

197
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,920
But this is the trouble is that

198
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,040
in our everyday look,

199
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,440
outlook, we are like that.

200
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
You will see that everywhere you go in the villages

201
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,440
the problem is, there are bathrooms, there are WCs,

202
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,520
but never repaired.

203
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Once spoiled means spoiled once for all.

204
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,040
Telephone is spoiled, it's spoiled forever.

205
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,400
At least in America people will go and buy; they will not repair.

206
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,680
They will go and buy new one.

207
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,080
Here they will not buy new one,

208
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,720
nor they will have any replacement -

209
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,680
carry on with it throughout.

210
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,600
That is a very bad character we have got, which we must change.

211
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,520
We should try to see everything is working all right.

212
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
Now, come to the Kundalini,

213
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,240
supposing the Kundalini goes out of order.

214
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,040
Are we going to give it up?

215
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,160
If one chakra is not good, are we going to give it up?

216
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
If there's something wrong with -

217
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,680
that point Indians are very particular,

218
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
much more than the Western -

219
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,920
if the kundalini is out, they'll get after it.

220
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,680
If one chakra is out, they'll get after it, they'll clean it.

221
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,360
Because they are the roots, you see,

222
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
and the root doesn't bother about the beauty;

223
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
but the tree has to look after the beauty.

224
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,280
So this is a combination which has to be worked out properly

225
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
by you both.

226
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,600
And the things will work out very well, I think,

227
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
if you understand

228
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,840
what co-relationship you have with each other,

229
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,400
what you have to learn from them

230
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,040
and what they have to learn from you.

231
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Now, today is a special day I thought of having a Puja,

232
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,640
because today is the moon - just see, in front of Me here -

233
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
and today is the day, first day, the moon is waxing.

234
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,680
In the science of Sahaja Yoga,

235
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,640
the moon is the spirit in our heart.

236
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,200
It is the spirit in our heart,

237
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
meaning in Marathi "Purnantara",

238
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,080
is the spirit in our heart,

239
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,600
and it shines when the sun

240
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
reflects on it.

241
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,680
When the sun - the sun,

242
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,000
that is the Son of God.

243
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,560
When the Son of God reflects on the heart,

244
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
then the moon shines in the human heart.

245
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,040
But when it shines as a moon,

246
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,440
then Shiva Himself lifts it up

247
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
and puts it on His head.

248
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,000
So the human beings

249
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
who are

250
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,080
blessed by the Son of God,

251
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,400
who are being

252
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,240
awakened by the Son of God,

253
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,040
that is you can say that

254
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,600
it is Shri Ganesh

255
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,160
or Lord Jesus Christ,

256
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,760
any one of them,

257
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,240
if they enlighten the heart of human beings,

258
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,040
then it becomes a shining moon.

259
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,280
And the "amavasya", the day

260
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,400
when it's the dark night,

261
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,960
is when a man is not a realized soul at all.

262
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,440
The realized soul is like the full moon.

263
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Now today is the day

264
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,400
when the moon is slightly,

265
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,280
one degree less.

266
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
It's a important day for us

267
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,680
because this is the first day

268
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,600
when it is waxing.

269
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,920
And that is the day we have to fix up our

270
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,800
moon within ourselves,

271
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,760
that we start waxing

272
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,800
by degrees.

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
Into sixteen degrees we to go on waxing.

274
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
And when that happens we don't realize,

275
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,720
that there is no shining.

276
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,400
The shining is going out.

277
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,080
And we have to be careful,

278
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
we have to look after it,

279
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
and we have to work it out

280
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,880
so that we worship that day when it starts waxing.

281
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,480
It can wax with many things.

282
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,800
You see, we have so many ways of finishing off

283
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the light that God has given us in our heart,

284
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,360
that is the spirit.

285
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,080
One of them is,

286
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,080
very great one, is the thinking,

287
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
that we do about it.

288
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,640
The first it starts when we start thinking about it,

289
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
rationalizing about it.

290
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,040
You must know that when I speak,

291
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,560
I don't speak - actually these are all mantras,

292
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,000
and whatever I do,

293
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,360
I work it out in such a way

294
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,200
that what I'm saying works out within you.

295
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,880
It's the Krita Yuga, and it works out.

296
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
When I say that, the whole machinery gets geared up.

297
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
So when I say something,

298
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,920
if you start reflecting it in your mind you are gone,

299
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,760
because you are not receiving what I am trying to do.

300
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,160
If it is a mantra,

301
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
that means whatever I am saying,

302
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,760
those sound waves will create

303
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,480
that being within you

304
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,880
that I am describing.

305
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,960
So at that time, once you start thinking about it

306
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,120
you cannot receive it,

307
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,880
because you have put a barrier of your thought.

308
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,280
So when I'm talking, just try to receive it.

309
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,200
Just say "yes, yes" inside,

310
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,280
so that you receive it within yourself.

311
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
So this is one of the greatest problems of today,

312
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,040
is that whatever you say

313
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,600
everybody must answer,

314
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,520
everybody must argue,

315
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,560
everybody must say,

316
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,320
"No, this could be that way, that could be,

317
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,080
there are alternatives, this, that"  -  everything goes on.

318
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,240
There is no need at all to do all that.

319
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
And when you start doing that,

320
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,760
then all the Gods and Goddesses get angry one by one,

321
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,520
and that's how you start losing your light within yourself.

322
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,360
So this is the most displeasing thing

323
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
for Gods and Goddesses,

324
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,720
that you don't recognize Me.

325
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,960
That you don't recognize Me fully.

326
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,000
That you still argue with Me.

327
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Still you start asking questions.

328
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,800
Still you start giving Me alternatives.

329
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,680
Absolutely, this is just not necessary

330
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,720
for you to go on arguing,

331
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
to go on discussing it.

332
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,080
It is just that you assimilate

333
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,440
whatever I am saying,

334
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,680
and that assimilation itself

335
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,000
will open out those new dimensions within you,

336
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,160
which God wants to be opened out.

337
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,560
So better surrender in that way your ego.

338
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Ego is the one that makes you say something,

339
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,320
argue something, discuss something.

340
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,280
And this is what is the biggest problem,

341
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
what that I have seen

342
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,880
when the first day of the waxing starts.

343
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
So today is the first day when we should say that,

344
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,640
that our ego should not start that drooping down.

345
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,680
It was nice to dance, enjoy, everything,

346
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,240
but then when you sit down -

347
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,160
while dancing you can't think, thank God!

348
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,040
But as soon as the whole thing is over you sit down,

349
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,760
again the mind starts going on "tack, tack, tack, tack"

350
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
and then we start thinking.

351
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,080
And once we start thinking,

352
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,040
then we are losing that light which we have received.

353
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Sort of, the moon has started waxing.

354
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,000
And that point one has to be careful,

355
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,080
because that's the most important thing.

356
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,360
If you do not allow it to happen first time,

357
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,960
then it can stop.

358
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,080
It's very simple to understand

359
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,680
that if you can stop

360
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,440
a sari or a last bit of it,

361
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,600
it will not blown off,

362
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,360
because you are holding onto it.

363
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,200
So at the very beginning of waxing of the moon,

364
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
if you are careful about it,

365
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
if you are alert about it,

366
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,800
it will never happen; whatever you have achieved

367
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,039
will be sustained, and then you can increase.

368
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,880
But that's the very important point which we miss,

369
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,360
and that's why we have lots of trouble

370
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,720
and lots of problems in Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,800
So now as you are moving for your further journey,

372
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
so many of you have come for the first time,

373
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,520
I have to tell you:   Don't think!

374
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Don't reflect!

375
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,120
In this you must learn from Indians.

376
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,120
They don't think about these things.

377
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,560
But they have to think, because when they think

378
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,120
they'll start thinking about gross things which they have to think.

379
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
I mean you don't think.

380
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
You'll be giving up all that is nonsensical

381
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,560
that you have been thinking about.

382
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,080
So don't think about it,

383
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,120
don't reflect, don't bother!

384
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,200
Try to be subtler and subtler

385
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,920
and not misidentified with your tags

386
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,280
that are outside - like hooks, you see.

387
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
And the mind is like a hook.

388
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,600
I have seen all of you have some

389
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
one hook outside

390
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,160
and all the yarns go, hook around it,

391
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,200
again another yarn goes and hooks around it.

392
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,800
And the whole mind is attached to that hook,

393
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,480
that is Mr. Ego.

394
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
If you can cut your strings somehow or other

395
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,360
and say, "I'm not going to think.

396
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,040
I have come here for my spiritual ascent.

397
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,680
Let me be what I am.

398
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,440
If Mother says something I'll listen to it.

399
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
She scolds me, I'll listen to it, She does something,

400
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,440
whatever She does, let me see

401
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,880
that, as I have come here for chiseling out myself,

402
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,840
let Her chisel me out, let the nature chisel me out,

403
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,920
let the whole atmosphere chisel me out,

404
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,600
Puja should chisel me out."

405
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,320
But you just become like a beautiful,

406
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,960
we can say a

407
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,160
jade in the hands of the Divine,

408
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,680
and allow the Divine

409
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,280
to take out all your beauty.

410
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
Just allow the Divine to take out your beauty,

411
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,480
and then you can enjoy your beauty.

412
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,640
But if you hand over to all these old things,

413
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,560
then it will be very difficult.

414
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,120
So as being the first day,

415
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,960
I have started it on the day

416
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,280
when the moon is about to wax, you see.

417
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,039
I hope you'll be all very careful about it.

418
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,960
Be alert!   You have to be very alert.

419
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,520
You have to go beyond time.

420
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
You don't have to think about food.

421
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,480
Once in a while if you don't eat, doesn't matter.

422
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,200
Nobody is going to die.   I tell you!

423
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,880
We don't eat for days together, nothing happens to us.

424
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
So food has not come,

425
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,720
the breakfast time, the dinner time -

426
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,960
I mean, there food is a religion, I think,

427
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,480
so everything has a time.

428
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,600
Here there is no time for anything.

429
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,520
We'll do whenever we feel like, you see?

430
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
Let's do that way.

431
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,320
So we have to be prepared for a nice thorough cleansing,

432
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,440
and a very enjoyable time throughout.

433
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,920
These two things can work hand in hand,

434
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,320
if you just accept

435
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
that you don't have to think.

436
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,560
If you don't think, everything can be done

437
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,160
without any problem, and you'll enjoy life very much.

438
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
So that's one thing.
