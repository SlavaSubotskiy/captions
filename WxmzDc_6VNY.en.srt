1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,700
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:42,220
At the very outset, I have to say you should
know what is the truth.

3
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,040
Everybody is seeking the truth.

4
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,100
But they have no idea as to what they should
find.

5
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,300
There is an earch within us.

6
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,200
Because these times are special.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,280
And we are seeking.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:17,140
But still, we don't have a clear cut idea
as to what we should seek and what we should achieve after our seeking.

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:33,180
I would like to refer, to all those
great books on religion, about truth.

10
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,660
They all have said that you have to know yourself.

11
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:48,820
Knowing yourself is the point and that you
have to become the spirit.

12
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:04,220
It's said in all these religions but we can find, that these religions are not really doing that. They're not

13
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,440
yet able to give you the truth.

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,580
That is why there is so much of conflict,

15
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,940
so much of fights going on.

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,820
There are really religions, no doubt.

17
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,380
And the essence of every religion is the same.

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:31,020
Despite all that they're fighting in the name
of the religion, how can that be?

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:45,000
It can be explained very well that if you
have lost your way, we can go into opposite directions.

20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:03:00,120
So when we know that we have to know ourselves, and that is our goal of life, that is how we are going to improve on our...

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,440
Life is such that has been not so clearly
explained.

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:18,840
But, where there is an argument within us
or not, is been told by most of them,

23
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:28,920
and that argument has must have been told to you, lies in the triangular bone 3 and a half coils

24
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:42,120
of energy, which is divine, which can connect us to the all-pervading power of truth, which is a very subtle energy.

25
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,180
When that happens, you get connected with that power.

26
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,580
And that power starts flowing through you.

27
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,260
You can feel it on your fingertips that power flowing.

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,700
This is a fact. We have to first verify before denying it.

29
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:17,800
If it could happen to you all that you can feel this all pervading power on your fingertips.

30
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:31,320
Then it's an experience, it's, not just by giving you a big lecture or telling you about something fantastic, but it is actualization.

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:42,040
Most important thing is the actualization is the becoming of your being the Spirit.

32
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,340
This has to happen, all kinds of acrobats people may tell you.

33
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,380
It's, absolutely, I must say, is a false pretext.

34
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,580
No amount of acrobats are necessary.

35
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,200
It is Sahaj. Sahaj means spontaneous, it is within you.

36
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,520
All of you have this power.

37
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:28,560
All of you are capable of becoming the Spirit, but you must understand what you should expect, what you should become.

38
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,980
Unless and until you have proper value system about it nothing can be explained.

39
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,900
And you can be mislead by all other nonsensical things.

40
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,540
Of course, you can't pay for it because it's a living process of your evolution.

41
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,860
Now you are  at a human awareness, but it's, not so fluent.

42
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,800
You have to rise higher, higher into the realm of the spirituality.

43
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,060
It's, not spiritualism, but spirituality, where you become the Spirit, the master.

44
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,460
It's, not difficult at all, I assure you, it's not difficult..

45
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:27,480
America has bean some on the last place, because I came long time back to begin with.

46
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:37,400
But I found people were running after all kinds of business nonsensical people.

47
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,940
Then I gave up.

48
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:50,240
I said I would go to America after 9 years, and then I came, and gradually I started understanding that they are seekers.

49
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,860
They're really seekers.

50
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:02,400
Not that they are in any way hypocritical, but it is the way people are enticing them

51
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:14,640
and taking them under their own control, that they can not see the point and the point is, you can't do anything about it.

52
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,540
A person may come and tell you: "you must get detached, give me all your property, all your money,

53
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:32,580
then i will give you two pair off clothes to wear". So many have done that by doing this kind of nonsense.

54
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Are you going to enter inside yourself ?

55
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,480
Is it possible?

56
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Just think of it. So many people have come here telling you all kinds of stories.

57
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,060
In your humble seeking you have been mislaid, and I feel very sorry for it.

58
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:04,460
Now try to understand that you have been very special people as a human beings.

59
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:15,860
And that you have to become a super-human being, we can call the greatly evolved soul we have so many.

60
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,540
We had so many, and those we had, we call them by different names.

61
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:32,920
They were called the Sufis and big master's, but they are not intelligible, normally to people,

62
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,660
because unless and until you have the awareness, which is enlightened by your Spirit,

63
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,680
you cannot understand what they're talking about.

64
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:53,380
Now the time has come for all of you to get your realization. You have been seeking for ages.

65
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,760
It is already described in books that the day will come the time will come.

66
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:19,120
They call it as Kali Yuga is the worst time that is now. At this time, people who are seeking God in the hills and dales, we'll get into proper family life,

67
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,380
and they will get their self-realization through this Kundalini awakening.

68
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,100
Now, in the name of Kundalini, also lots of nonsense has been said,

69
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:40,100
which is surprising. How people accepted that Kundalini can be dangerous

70
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:53,300
and a person who gets in Kundalini awakening will be very much harmed. Now she is your Mother.

71
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:03,200
Kundalini is your exclusive Mother, She knows each and everything about you She knows about

72
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:14,720
your false and also your aspirations, everything is recorded in Her and She's, extremely careful when She gives you the second birth,

73
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
and She takes up all your problems upon Herself, She doesn't bother you.

74
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:28,680
She doesn't trouble you and she's, the one who looks after your second birth.

75
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Again, I say, is actualization, actualization of baptism you can call it, but it's not the way they do.

76
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:48,880
It's actualization it happens that this rises passes through 6 centers and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

77
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:59,680
and you do feel on your hands, fingers, and out off your head, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

78
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,220
This has to happen.

79
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:11,280
Otherwise, whatever stories one matter, you should not believe. It has to show results.

80
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,640
Now the centers that we have.

81
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:32,500
All these 7 centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being, so many people get cured.

82
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,840
Many people have problems mentally, they get cured,

83
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,140
and spiritually you get endowed with the absolute knowledge,

84
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:52,700
not knowledge that we learned in the schools or colleges, but their knowledge, which is absolute.

85
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:06,880
For example, if you want to know about someone, you can ask a question and you'll be amazed.

86
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,940
If the question is yes, then you start getting
the cool breeze flowing fast.

87
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:24,699
But if it is no or it is wrong, then you might get a little tingle or might get very hot

88
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:39,700
from those persons who are to be tested. It's, a very, very interesting precise and a scientific method.

89
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,660
Now, if there are doctors, I would like to tell that you get in control with the parasympathetic nervous system.

90
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:57,300
Luckily, there's going to be a big conference
with Me with the doctors in New York, I don't know what the association it is.

91
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,700
In that they are convinced now.

92
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:15,020
That what I'm saying is a fact and that
helps you. You get cured by yourself.

93
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,880
And you can also cure others.

94
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,340
There is no need to have this horrible modern diseases that you are afraid of.

95
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,160
You can just find out about it in no time.

96
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:43,960
Apart from that you just know how to treat others, how to cure others, how to help others.

97
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:57,560
But apart from that, what you get is a spiritual blessing. And the spiritual blessing is this that you get the peace in your heart.

98
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,440
Surprisingly, when this Kundalini rises She some or other,

99
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,540
by joining with the Divine power, all providing power,

100
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:24,000
assumes the personality, which is extremely pure, extremely benevolent, extremely tolerant, extremely truthful.

101
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:39,180
All your enemies that we call like anger, lust, greed, all these enemies just dropped

102
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:52,800
and you are no more in the entanglement of those and you become a free person, absolutely a free person, above all.

103
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:07,000
You are so beautiful, you become such a nice person that established your peace.

104
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,960
Normal human beings. What do they do?

105
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,920
They react. They reacted on it.

106
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,120
See, they were telling Me that still there, this time people are still coming, doesn't matter.

107
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,140
You can come late. There is no "don't come just now", right?

108
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:40,600
But I don't know how to react, and that's why when I came to see molested, you look very relaxed I said, I never reacted to that, so you don't react.

109
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:49,900
By not reaction what happens that the thoughts that come to you come from the future and the past

110
00:15:50,040 --> 00:16:02,460
and you are lost in those thoughts because they're jumping on the cuss of this thoughts when the Kundalini rises, the thoughts are like these.

111
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:11,480
She lingers those thoughts and the space is created, which equalities pause or ...

112
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,700
In that state, you've become absolutely peaceful.

113
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,940
You don't think anymore, we call it thoughtless awareness.

114
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:30,820
That Jung has described. That means, you watch anything, just as a witness, see everything as a witness.

115
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,240
See, this is a nice carpet here. I see it.

116
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,480
Supposing it belonged to Me If I was normal, I would have said, oh My God, I don't know.

117
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,440
How are they going to keep it?

118
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:57,260
In case this belongs to somebody else I would appreciate it, and I say, oh, I must buy this, how much it will cost, I hope it's insured and all kinds of things.

119
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:06,360
But if I am the realized person, then I just watch it without thinking

120
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:18,520
and the joy that the artist has put into this
carpet enables you to enjoy, enjoy it without reaction.

121
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:27,080
And this state, we call it Sahaja was done
where a person becomes absolutely one with himself.

122
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:38,820
Complete. When he looks at anything, he doesn't react, he sees, he becomes the witness, you become just a witness of the hole things.

123
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,920
Your memory improves, your ideas about creation, anything.

124
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:58,740
I mean, you become an extremely, extremely I should say creative person, and you don't develop the pride.

125
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,020
You don't develop falsehood, but just enjoy creating something.

126
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:13,180
Human being is the most useful thing and the most beautiful thing the Divine has created.

127
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,660
But we don't know what we are.

128
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,000
That’s why always it is said, no ..., no yourself.

129
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,780
Unless and until you know yourself, how can you say "i hate myself" or "i do, i do that".

130
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,980
Actually, the beauty lies within you

131
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,000
and is to be expressed through these Divine vibrations.

132
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:52,320
Now the health improves no doubt, so many have improved their health, but I've seen in London

133
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
in the beginning, so many boys were taking
drugs.

134
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
Give it up overnight.

135
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,060
I never say, "don't, give up".

136
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,120
I don't say "don't..".

137
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,140
If you say "don't", then they will have and then will run away. Let them take, let them get their realization

138
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:18,760
then automatically, the whole thing drops out, and you shoot up out of that and become the real personality.

139
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:27,640
That's you know the reality, because you're not any more contaminated by your ego or your superego.

140
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,640
This thoughts come to you from your ego or superego meaning your conditioning, you're no...

141
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:43,020
You're absolutely free and you see everything in its real position.

142
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:51,460
This kind of thing happened was already destined. Has been already prophesied.

143
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,420
That is going to happen in those days.

144
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,880
And so if (you can come here, this side we have chairs).

145
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,460
Alright.

146
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:18,820
So this is how we are going to become ourselves and we will know what we are and what we are capable of.

147
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:28,740
Our capabilities are fathomless, but unless
and until we are connected, how can we act,

148
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,700
for example, this instrument, if it is not connected to the means, it is useless.

149
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,040
In the same way you are to be connected to the means, is very important.

150
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,760
For that you don't have to do anything.

151
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,920
It just works spontaneously within you.

152
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,780
And you get your selfrealization without any doubt.

153
00:20:51,780 --> 00:21:00,000
Actually, I must have given thousands of lectures all over the world and there's no end of it.

154
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,320
I would like you people to ask Me some questions, which I would like to answer, if you have any.

155
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:24,700
Yogi: Is there any questions? You could raise a hand?

156
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,020
Seeker: What is the purpose of having the photograph?

157
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,980
Shri Mataji: If you can do without the photograph nothing like it.

158
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:52,460
But you need something to support and that's why people use the photograph if you don't need it, it's alright.

159
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,460
But you'll find you'll need it.

160
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,580
Alright.

161
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,920
Seeker: How do you awaken the Kundalini?

162
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,240
Shri Mataji: That's, My job I will do it, Alright?

163
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,260
It's very simple. How does a Mother Earth sprouts the seed?

164
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,360
How does She do it? Is innately building in Her that power, isn't it?

165
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,320
What else?

166
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,820
Seeker: What is the relationships between Paramatma and Kundalini?

167
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,140
Shri Mataji: Alright, very good question, Paramatma is the God Almighty, alright?

168
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:56,920
And His power is the addition is the power that has done all the creation, everything,

169
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:06,140
while Paramatma is the one who is just a spectator of the whole things, Drishta they call it.

170
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:19,180
While Adi Shakti is the one who does all the creation and everything. Paramatma, is in your heart reflected as Spirit.

171
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:32,020
And Kundalini is reflected in your triangular bone as Adi Shakti. Adi Shakti's reflection is the Kundalini.

172
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,300
Oh, you'll get absolute knowledge, everything.

173
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,900
Seeker: What should come first?

174
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,300
Shri Mataji: What should come first? What?

175
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,040
Seeker: The Kundalini awakening or dissolving the jealousy in other ...?

176
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:20,140
Shri Mataji: No, no,  Kundalini awakening is the one by which all these things happened.

177
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,000
Automatically.

178
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:32,600
Seeker: Is it not first necessary to work on the negative tendencies and then get the Kundalini awakening?

179
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,360
Shri Mataji: There is no need. In Sahaja Yoga, there's no need to work it out.

180
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:51,460
The negative forces themselves run away, 99%. In 1% maybe it still sticks, but otherwise, a ninety nine percent.

181
00:24:51,460 --> 00:25:00,540
They all run away with the light of the Kundalini with the enlightenment of the Spirit in your attention.

182
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,500
Seeker: Can i continue with my best chief (?) as long as i'm awakening my Kundalini?

183
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,960
Shri Mataji: Yeah, of course.

184
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,360
No doubt.

185
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:24,020
You only on the contrary you've become multidimensional personality.

186
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,620
You try, you can do it.

187
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:44,920
If you're doing something wrong, you can't do it after Kundalini awakening, because you see what is destructive for you and what is constructive.

188
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,820
So you don't do it.You just don't do it.

189
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,320
I told you just now that overnight people gave up drugs.

190
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,640
I didn't tell them.

191
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,660
Is the light. If you are sitting in the darkness, you don't know where are you.

192
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,720
But if there is light, you know, everything is
like that is enlightenment I'm talking about.

193
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:17,580
Seeker: What is the first step to not desire?

194
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,660
Shri Mataji: Just to desire that, you should get your selfrealization.

195
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,440
You must have a strong desire.

196
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes, madam.

197
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,700
Huh?

198
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:45,700
Seeker: By practicing this can i control my heartfelt?

199
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:54,440
Shri Mataji: Everything, everything. If it's controlling, you don't have to do.

200
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:16,880
Seeker: Because of practicing a Christian religion she feels that she is going to hell

201
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,440
Shri Mataji: Correct.

202
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,860
Seeker: and does that mean that by practicing this it will be the same?

203
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:34,800
Shri Mataji: I was also born in a Christian religion and I know that how Christianity was just opposite of Christ, but (just a minute).

204
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:45,660
But after realization, you are enlightened, and you see the beauty of every religion, and the essence of every religion.

205
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:52,540
And then you also understand that you are
capable yourself

206
00:27:52,540 --> 00:28:05,160
of following a spiritual part without any difficulties, nothing destructive, nothing wrong nothing manipulated.

207
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,080
It's, your own. You become your own master.

208
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:27,020
Seeker: Have you ever met before Mahatma Yoganath and are you follow his teaching?

209
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:38,980
Shri Mataji: Those who have met... I've nothing to say.

210
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Seeker: Have you leave your body and travel?

211
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,360
Shri Mataji: I don't want to do that.

212
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,800
What's the use it is done through some spirits I think.

213
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,320
Yes, madam.

214
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,180
Seeker: She has a desire she has love, but so many forces pull you away from that...

215
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,380
Shri Mataji: Yes it's correct. But just now, just now, I promise you that you will get your realization.

216
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,240
And then you'll see all these forces would drop out, alright?

217
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,260
[not English]

218
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,960
Yes, this means left side is chot up, who is written this letter?

219
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,340
That means left side is not alright.

220
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,680
But it can be put right.

221
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:12,940
Seeker: You said that it is a special time. Talk a little bit more about that.

222
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:21,760
Shri Mataji: Its called as Kali Yuga. And also this is the time of last judgment.

223
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:36,460
And at this time, one has to be very careful because you are going to be judged whether you take to truth or not.

224
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:45,020
If you are still with falsehood, you are judged you will judge yourself, nobody needs to judge you.

225
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,600
By so many things will happen that we realized there's something wrong.

226
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,720
Seeker: What was the advice that Mahatma Gandhi gave to you when you was little?

227
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,600
Shri Mataji: He didn't give Me any advice. I had to give him advice.

228
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,640
But he did say that let our country be free.

229
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,300
Then you can start your Sahaja Yoga program not before that.

230
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,180
That was his idea that we are not yet free to propagate anything.

231
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:52,720
Seeker: After you awakening Kundalini tonight how often should we do it?

232
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,000
Shri Mataji: Very good question.

233
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,440
You don't have to.. there is no number of times, you have to do it on the ones it is enlighten It is enlighten.

234
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,240
But we have problems still there.

235
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:19,320
So the Kundalini goes back to correct it sometimes, so we have here a proper "follow up" they call it, and after that we have centres where you can go.

236
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Also, nobody will charge any money.

237
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,980
And they'll find out for wrong with you and that all try to tell you what is to be done.

238
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:39,340
It happens with very few, but you'll enjoy going to the center because it's all enjoyment there.

239
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,800
Free of charge.

240
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,820
Seeker: Does that mean that we should not do this very often ourself alone?

241
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,140
Shri Mataji: There will tell you, you have to meditate, that they will tell you how to meditate.

242
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,800
And if you follow it for ten-fifteen minutes at the most, and it works out and you can grow,

243
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:09,500
because after all this first germination of the seed, you see is there.

244
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,660
But it has to grow and some people grow so fast.

245
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:20,960
I'm surprised some times that at the very first meeting, only they become great people.

246
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,640
Seeker: Does the Kundalini ever become ... ?

247
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,300
Shri Mataji: No It does not.

248
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:43,260
But if you try not to pay attention, to its proper alignment or proper development

249
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,780
then it becomes static at that point. But it never goes back.

250
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:06,140
Seeker: For many years i've been trying to meet you and i'm very blessed to see you here.

251
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,280
Shri Mataji: I see.

252
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:32,060
Seeker: Ones we have got it what can we do to bring more peace to our community?

253
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:39,360
Shri Mataji: You can you can do it if you're desired so you can really help them you can really help.

254
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,540
I mean that's what is happening now as you see these people say that Sahaja Yoga is working in eighty six countries.

255
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:55,140
What happened that one person got his realization he went to his country and he changed so many people.

256
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:03,300
In a far fish country like Benin imagine Benin where they have mostly muslims

257
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,480
there are seven thousand sahaja yogis. In Turkey we have three thousand.

258
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:20,940
And in a so many places we have but the maximum in Benin where there are mostly people who are who were Muslims.

259
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,120
And I was surprised why did you become Muslims? So they said because the French were here and

260
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,060
we didn't like the way they're were immoral so we thought their religion is no good so became Muslims

261
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,260
but now they are great sahaja yogis very very great sahaja yogis.

262
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:49,240
So many Muslim countries have become sahaja yogis. All over the world we have. In Russia we have thousands and thousands and thousands.

263
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:57,420
And Russians are very deep people. I tell you the so called freedom we had we have gone helter skelter

264
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:06,800
while the Russians had no freedom they could not even talk about God they did not read anything about Divine

265
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,340
and they developed I think out of the communism developed within themselves

266
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,560
a very, very deep understanding and they are there.

267
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:28,220
You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga is now practiced in so many countries where I never even thought I would reach,

268
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,940
but sahaja yogis have gone and done the job.

269
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,140
...

270
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,860
Seeker: What is your first recollection about your childhood of been awaken? How old were you?

271
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,380
Shrei Mataji: Now, can I ask you one question? What was your first

272
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,200
understanding that you are a human being?

273
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,780
It's like that.

274
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,360
As you were aware of your being a human being I was aware.

275
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:34,020
Seeker: You said you were born in a Christian family, so what is your faith what is your religion, what is your God?

276
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,040
Shri Mataji: I have no religion.

277
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,180
I have all the religions.

278
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,580
Born in any family should not

279
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,820
sort of

280
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,060
stop your region.

281
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:57,040
You can see through everything if you have the light.

282
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,040
This another one. Now I was, Im must say.

283
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,280
Here there are so many people were asking questions, normally, I don't find that experience.

284
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,040
Doesn't matter. But how many will become good sahaja yogis is to be seen out of you.

285
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,800
It's, alright, to ask questions after questions, but that is of no value

286
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:36,020
unless and until you really become what I'm saying, a sahaja yogi, the real personality.

287
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:44,160
That is absolutely spiritually so we have to see that, that is the challenge for all of you,

288
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:53,960
let's see how many. I must say, Los Angeles has bean really a lost angeles, so far for Me.

289
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,340
But sahaja yogis always felt that I can do very well, so I came.

290
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:07,880
Now this is the fifth question you're asking, madam, will you please take your realization and then ask Me, alright?

291
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,100
This another one.

292
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,780
You see, once you have asked a question, you shouldn't ask another question, please.

293
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,800
Because all of them are waiting for their Self Realization, they're all waiting for their Self Realization.

294
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,120
Only few who want to ask questions is one is alright.

295
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,780
But not all the time go on asking questions. What is that?

296
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,380
Unless and until you are a journalist?

297
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,580
I'd be a ...

298
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,340
Yogi: Can we start?

299
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,940
Shri Mataji: Yes, we should.

300
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,780
Can you now write your questions and let Me know?

301
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,520
I'll answer them after you get your Relation.

302
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,640
Then you won't have any questions I know.

303
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,580
Again, I said, it is the becoming.

304
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,580
You have to become it's, not just talking.

305
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,620
Now, forget your questions for the time being.

306
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,580
Better get your Religion, alright?

307
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:50,420
Now, one thing is that you have to just take
out your shoes or chapas, anything,

308
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,680
because this Mother Earth is of a great help.

309
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,680
She sucks in all of our problems.

310
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,800
Put both the feet apart from each other.

311
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,160
You will know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,760
Why I said, to put your feet apart from each other.

313
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,560
Everything you will know very clearly, but they should touch the Mother Earth.

314
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,820
You have to just be comfortable.

315
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,460
And all of you should be seated.

316
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:44,440
Before I start, I have to request that those who want their Realization only I can give them.

317
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:52,820
It cannot be forced because Kundalini is the pure desire is the pure desire.

318
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
Not impure desire as we have.

319
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,900
Whatever desired we have we had today one, then we want to have something else that's, the principle of economics.

320
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,160
But this is pure desire and for this pure desire you should be determined to get it.

321
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:18,440
Is your own character. Your own understanding only will work it out.

322
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:34,000
Now, I would request you all to sit comfortably with both feet like this very comfortably. And put both your hands, towards Me, like this.

323
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,820
Now what I find that some of you feel guilty.

324
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,960
It's a nonsense.

325
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:15,020
If you feel guilty, then this center here catches on the left hand side and the Kundalini doesn't move.

326
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,460
So if you have done anything wrong, I agree.

327
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,080
So it's finished. That's the past.

328
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:30,260
You don't have to worry about that at this moment, please.

329
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:41,180
You have to know that you are not guilty at all for anything, so please forgive yourself.

330
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,960
Please forgive yourself.

331
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,740
Now the second thing is that we have to forgive also others.

332
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:57,260
Now, some people say it's, difficult to forgive, Mother, having, what do you do?

333
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:03,620
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything what do you do?

334
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:09,340
Nothing. But by not forgiving, you torture
yourself.

335
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,080
So best thing is to forgive all of them.

336
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:20,300
Forgive everybody, who was harmed you, who has troubled you, has made you unhappy, has hurt you.

337
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:25,320
Forgive, don't also think about them. It's also useless.

338
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,640
By forgiving, you don't know what will happen.

339
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,200
Absolutely, you will feel peaceful with yourself.

340
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:42,500
Just forgive everyone. This nobleness you should accept today that you forgive everyone just forgive.

341
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,980
Now, please put your hands towards Me. Like this.

342
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,740
Comfortably.

343
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:09,240
Now you can put your right hand towards Me and feel with the left hand on top of your fontanelle bone area

344
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:21,720
little higher, if there is any cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, are coming out of your own head.

345
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,800
On your ... you can feel it.

346
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:40,720
You move your hand up and down and see for yourself if you are feeling, please remove your caps If you have, please. Its better to  remove.

347
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,080
Now, please see.

348
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,680
You must have respect for yourself,

349
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,460
should not denounce yourself and you should also forgive everyone. That's, very important.

350
00:46:53,660 --> 00:47:01,740
Now put the left hand towards Me and put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area

351
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:18,420
and bend your head, just bend your head, and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own fontanelle bone area.

352
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,740
This is the actualization of the baptism. You may call it.

353
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,940
Once more, put your right hand towards Me.

354
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,100
And see with your left hand

355
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:50,800
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area, please keep your head bendy.

356
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,320
Now.

357
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,220
If it is hot means you have not forgiven yourself, or you have not forgiven others.

358
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:20,780
So again, please forgive. Please forgive yourself and forgive others. That's a very great ascent and help.

359
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,680
Now see for yourself.

360
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:43,200
If there's a cool or a hot breeze coming on your fingertips or on your palms.

361
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,000
Please forgive, forgive.

362
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,220
Forgive yourself and forgive others.

363
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:13,220
Very important, because this center here, when the crossing of the optic ...

364
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:21,240
it get obstructed if you have not forgiven, so please forgive because its a myth not to forgive.

365
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,500
So please forgive.

366
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:41,660
I would say all those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or hot breeze

367
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:51,320
on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanelle bone area,

368
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,460
hot or cool breeze,

369
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,460
please raise your hands.

370
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,260
Mostly all of you've got it.

371
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:18,660
Mostly. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you all. In such a short time you have got it.

372
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:25,580
That means really we have got very wonderful people this time from Los Angeles.

373
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,500
Those who are truly sickles, or real seekers may god bless you for that.

374
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:37,660
Now you must respect your realization, and I hope you'll grow into it.

375
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:47,680
You'll try to grow and become masters. Hardly it will take even one month maybe to become the masters.

376
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,500
Why not do it?

377
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,140
Alright?

378
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,140
May God bless you.
