1
00:01:43,698 --> 00:02:11,428
So we have decided, we have decided to have
the puja after our dinner because Shri Krishna

2
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:21,898
was born in the night, about twelve o’clock
while I was born twelve o’clock in the daytime,

3
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:25,258
same with Shri Rama.

4
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:38,578
And also Christ was born twelve o’clock
in the night.

5
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:52,058
I’ve told you that today I’m going to
tell you about Gita.

6
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:56,638
That is the second part of Krishna’s life.

7
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:06,258
So different and varied that some people,
intellectuals as usual, say that the Krishna

8
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:20,118
who played as a child in Gokul was different
from the Krishna who was the king of Dwarika.

9
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:33,318
So when He became the king of Dwarika there
was a war between Pandavas and Kauravas, one

10
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:41,898
representing the good people, another representing
the bad people.

11
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:51,098
So they came to ask Him if He would join on
their side.

12
00:03:51,098 --> 00:04:01,168
So He said, “I’ve got My army and I Myself,
so whichever you choose you can have.”

13
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:09,378
So Kauravas said, “We’ll have your army,”
but Pandavas said, “We’ll have you.”

14
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:25,758
And that is how the war started and in the
war His greatest disciple was one of

15
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:26,758
the Pandavas called Arjuna.

16
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:27,998
And Arjuna asked Him to fight for him.

17
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:38,188
He said, “I will not take any weapon in
my hand but I will be your charioteer and

18
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:44,228
drive your chariot.”

19
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:57,958
And when He was driving the chariot it so
happened that

20
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:02,528
Krishna saw Arjuna’s depression.

21
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:08,888
And Arjuna said, “What is this war?

22
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:12,938
Why should I fight?

23
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:22,068
I’m fighting my own gurus, those who have
taught me all the vidyas of the battleship,

24
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:38,938
battle, and also the vidya of archery and
I’m fighting my own cousins.”

25
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:47,508
So Shri Krishna said that, “They’re already
killed, they don’t exist, they’re already

26
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:57,128
dead people, because they’re not realized
souls, I’ve already killed them.

27
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:06,438
So you have to just play this drama of killing
them.”

28
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:14,828
So the foremost contradiction that people
present about Gita is that those who read

29
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:18,298
Gita should be vegetarian.

30
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:25,388
Krishna told, Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,
“You kill them.”

31
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:33,938
Human beings, his own relations, his own cousins
who were bad people.

32
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:37,028
What about chickens and goats?

33
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:50,237
But all those who start reading Gita in India
give up all meat eating and take to vegetarianism,

34
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:53,308
or they fast.

35
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:56,878
So how contradictory these things are.

36
00:06:56,878 --> 00:07:00,388
So He never preached vegetarianism, at least
in Gita.

37
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:16,748
And He asked Arjuna to kill.

38
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:24,158
In the modern times there is a war going on
between the evil force and the good.

39
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:31,688
You don’t have to kill them; even if you
give them bandhan they’re already dead,

40
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:37,238
they’re not realized souls, they’ll be
all neutralized.

41
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:43,538
But you have to kill them in the sense you’ve
to kill your connections with them.

42
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:50,778
Like I see many people who come to Sahaja
Yoga, “But my mother is not yet a Sahaja

43
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:55,288
Yogini, so she troubles me, how can I do Sahaja
Yoga?”

44
00:07:55,288 --> 00:08:00,058
For anything else they’ll fight the mother
but not for this.

45
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:05,517
“Kill your attachments and your relations.”

46
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:13,028
That’s what He said, if in case they are
troubling you in your ascent.

47
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:21,718
This is the message of Gita to begin with.

48
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:32,248
But on the contrary I’ve seen there are
people in Sahaja Yoga who once they get married

49
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:37,838
want to get out of Sahaja Yoga, take out their
husbands or take out their wives or want to

50
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:47,528
live away and want to be non-collective.

51
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,768
So you have to kill.

52
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:57,278
There are <Sanskrit word>, there are six enemies
human beings have but in the modern times

53
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:04,688
they have multiplied, I think.

54
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:12,038
The first one is the lust.

55
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:16,378
Kill your lust.

56
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:25,237
The lust that is today finishing the West
more than the greed.

57
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:30,808
So first is to kill your lust.

58
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:39,628
Then kill your anger.

59
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:46,558
There are certain people who have a built-in
response that as soon as they see somebody

60
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:51,748
they get into anger.

61
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:55,997
If a white man sees a black man he gets into
an anger, a black man sees a white man he

62
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:57,767
gets into anger, surprising.

63
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:07,218
I mean, God has made all kinds of things;
the life would be boring if you all have the

64
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:11,638
same parched skins, all of you looking the
same.

65
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,958
So he has made different types of beautiful
people.

66
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:22,698
But this anger can come from any source.

67
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:28,578
This is what it is when you kill anger, actually
you kill all your connections with the past,

68
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:39,898
the responses, the conditionings you have
had.

69
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:53,888
Then the vanity that people have; I find it
much more when I go to places where people

70
00:10:53,888 --> 00:11:07,317
call themselves bureaucrats or they’re “in
charge,” like matrons telling people what

71
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,477
to do, “Do this, do that, do that.”

72
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:12,949
This is the Krishna’s finger, using Krishna’s
finger on others.

73
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:24,708
The vanity, the vanity that you are perfect,
you are perfect, “Nothing wrong with me.”

74
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:32,807
You are the best people, English think they’re
the best, Germans think they’re the best,

75
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:42,978
Italians think they’re the best, or, say,
the best of all are the Switzerland, Swiss

76
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,927
people.

77
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:57,737
This vanity, this forge, has to be cut up.

78
00:11:57,737 --> 00:12:02,437
What have you achieved by being a certain
nation, let us see.

79
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:08,718
What have you contributed, belonging to a
certain country.

80
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:16,417
Those who only belong to the Kingdom of God
have achieved something.

81
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:23,877
The rest of them are useless people, just
finding some way to fight each other, to denounce

82
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:30,177
others and vanity is just like a balloon.

83
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:39,148
If somebody just puts a pin into it the whole
balloon will collapse.

84
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:46,857
Now the worst of all is jealousy, and that
is among Indians, Indians are very big jealous

85
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:48,617
pots.

86
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:54,588
Specially the Indians who are again in the
government and the politics but otherwise

87
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,617
also there are jealousies.

88
00:12:56,617 --> 00:13:00,977
They’ll always complain about the other
people and will be jealous.

89
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:11,047
And also in the West people are quite jealous,
I must say.

90
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:21,667
They’re jealous of things which is most
surprising.

91
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:30,898
One day I was going in the car and one gentleman
was very furious for nothing.

92
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:36,167
So the another one tells Me, “They’re
jealous because you’re sitting in a Mercedes

93
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,167
car.”

94
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:41,167
I said, “But it’s not Mine, that’s My
husband’s, you see.”

95
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:45,357
What is there to be jealous because I’m
sitting in a Mercedes car.

96
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:52,048
I mean, this is being a very stupid, nonsensical
thing but still I can’t believe you can

97
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:59,537
be jealous of somebody because he has a Mercedes
car, what does it matter?

98
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:07,607
To Me, it’s a foreign idea absolutely, I
can’t understand.

99
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:11,328
But there are stupid and stupid things like
that.

100
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:29,548
I can only understand one jealousy, that is
between husband and wife, little bit.

101
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:32,448
<Laughter>

102
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:48,718
Then the fifth thing that He asked us to kill
is the attachment, very important, “This

103
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,698
is my child, this is my…”

104
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:57,328
This is Indian also, more Indian, “This
is my cousin, this is my brother, this is

105
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,807
my fiancé, this is my wife.”

106
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:08,667
Also in the West, the other way round is that
they do not care for their children.

107
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,148
They do not care for their mothers, they do
not care for their fathers.

108
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:21,127
They do not care for anyone whatsoever, but
for themselves.

109
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:25,847
That comes from the last one, is called as
the greed.

110
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:33,237
Now when you have greed, you don’t care
for anybody, you just want to have everything,

111
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:36,737
from another person.

112
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:41,467
You want to grab another person of everything.

113
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:47,117
Whatever another person has, you want to have
it.

114
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:50,907
But when you don’t want to have it everybody
wants to give you it, that’s My case.

115
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:57,837
I’m very afraid to say even that, “This
is nice,” because immediately tomorrow I’ll

116
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:07,927
find it in My house.

117
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:13,187
So this greed is the one which has done such
a harm to the whole world.

118
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:19,187
People have gone into great dominations on
other countries, for what?

119
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,918
For these diamonds and nonsensical things
like that?

120
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:28,397
They have ruined their own lives, the progenies
of the progenies they’ve ruined.

121
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:35,607
All their cunning they have used to ruin so
many nations just to put them one against

122
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:41,698
another, creating problems, doing all kinds
of intrique.

123
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:42,997
Just for what?

124
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:52,198
For greed which is absolutely like cancer,
doesn’t allow anybody else to exist.

125
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,977
And then you start eating yourself out.

126
00:16:56,977 --> 00:17:01,067
It’s a disease, I think, greed.

127
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:09,627
And with that goes the miserliness; people
become miserly.

128
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,487
Then where does this greed end up.

129
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:19,707
After all the money that accumulates or things
that accumulate in your house, what happens

130
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,817
to them?

131
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:28,127
You want to use them.

132
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:31,547
What’s the matter with this one?

133
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:38,638
Try to be, not to be, I’ve told, otherwise
I’ll ask you to go out, all right?

134
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:39,638
Concentrate.

135
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:47,117
So what happens to the people who are greedy?

136
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:54,268
They become miserly, they can’t enjoy life,
they cannot spend money because the greatest

137
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:58,857
joy is in giving things to others, no doubt
about it.

138
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:05,777
And they cannot give any joy to anyone, they
cannot create anything for the future progeny

139
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,457
to see.

140
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:08,957
So what happens to them?

141
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:14,227
Their children when they come in they become
wastrel, waste.

142
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:23,448
They waste all of them, they lead a wasteful
life, they get into wrong things, and ruin

143
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:24,448
themselves.

144
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,858
So their children who are born become miserly.

145
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,117
So the vicious circle starts moving.

146
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:43,798
He has said, “Kill all of them, these are
your six enemies.”

147
00:18:43,798 --> 00:19:00,078
Now the contradiction, again people use, about
Shri Krishna, in so many other ways that it

148
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:10,438
is surprising that not only Christ, not only
Mohamad Sahib, not only Lao Tze, not only

149
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:19,948
Shri Rama but even Krishna was misused by
His followers.

150
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:29,768
He’s the one who is datast, the one…,
datast means who stands on the banks of the

151
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:36,498
attention and sees everything, who watches
everything, he’s the one who is the witness.

152
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:45,928
He described, “Sakshi rupena samsthita,”
he becomes a sakshi, a witness.

153
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:53,938
That’s what He has said, it’s a play,
it’s a play.

154
00:19:53,938 --> 00:20:00,468
But in the name of Krishna you find all kinds
of absurd things people do.

155
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:06,618
They make dramas, they become Krishnas, they
become <inaudible >, they make people…,

156
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:12,098
befool them, make money out of it or they
sell books on the street.

157
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:17,348
Like if you go to Southall you’ll find so
many Westerners wearing funny dresses going

158
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:22,728
round asking for alms from Indians and Indians
say, “Oh look at that, these beggars, see

159
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:33,138
they have come to get some, let us give them
some money.”

160
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:47,008
So the contradiction of Krishna’s life is
such a miserable thing, is such a absurd thing

161
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:58,458
that it hurts Me to see how such a great incarnation
who was misused in this world by human beings.

162
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:04,298
If there was anything lacking in that incarnation,
was this, that He did not give realization

163
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:08,148
to people but He did talk about it.

164
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:20,868
He said about it, talked of meditation; He
did all that was needed at this stage.

165
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:25,448
But what is the result?

166
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,148
All His incarnation was misused.

167
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:36,858
Throughout Gita if you read, you’d be amazed
how people have changed Gita and its writings

168
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:37,858
also.

169
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,938
Same in the Bible and same in the Koran.

170
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:49,938
Things that they could never have said it,
how could they have said it, you’d be surprised,

171
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:54,738
impossible, because they cannot contradict
themselves.

172
00:21:54,738 --> 00:22:06,448
For example, Gita is written by Vyasa who
was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

173
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:17,288
But in the Gita it is written that your caste
is determined by your birth; how can it be?

174
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:27,938
The one who is the son of…, an illegitimate
son of a fisherwoman, how can he tell like

175
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:29,628
that?

176
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,928
See the contradiction.

177
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:37,488
Same in the Bible, same in the Koran, same
in the Koran, in all these books, all these

178
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:44,138
people have tried to play a very nasty role
by changing it.

179
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:47,838
But you can find it out.

180
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:53,938
Luckily, whatever they may try, the truth
comes out in this manner and you can prove

181
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:58,638
it that whatever you’re saying is wrong,
cannot be.

182
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:05,898
The one Vyasa who wrote was the son of a fisherwoman
and how can he say that Brahmins are the highest,

183
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,978
when he’s not born as a Brahmin.

184
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:14,788
And to say that your caste Brahminism comes
from your birth…

185
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:20,408
From your rebirth!

186
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:31,668
Only they removed little bit – rebirth.

187
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:38,148
This is how they interpreted Gita in various
ways in such contradictory manners.

188
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:50,998
His whole writings or sayings could not be
changed, of course, they could not change

189
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:56,058
it but wherever they wanted to put their own
style, they did it.

190
00:23:56,058 --> 00:24:01,148
Because ultimately, it went into the hands
of the Brahmins who were not really Brahmins,

191
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:06,548
they were the people who were sudras because
they were not even realized souls and behaving

192
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:09,568
in such a dirty manner; they should not be
called as Brahmins.

193
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:15,428
But it went into the hands of so-called Brahmins
and they misinterpreted it.

194
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:19,068
Same thing with Bible.

195
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:26,028
It went into the hands of horrid people.

196
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:33,388
Mr. John said something which was sensible,
all right, but what about the other fellow,

197
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,578
Paul?

198
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:42,568
He comes in and spoils everything.

199
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:46,768
Then comes Augustine, he spoils everything,
why?

200
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,118
Because they’re devils.

201
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:58,588
There is a evil force; this theory that there
is no evil force is a wrong theory, doesn’t

202
00:24:58,588 --> 00:24:59,588
exist.

203
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:10,658
There is a evil force and don’t play into
the hands of evil force even this much.

204
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:20,457
And that was clearly taught by Shri Krishna.

205
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:27,978
But even then the contradictions can come
in.

206
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:43,228
Like if you are a Krishna bhakta then if you
just start running on the street, “Krishna!

207
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:44,228
Krishna!

208
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:45,228
Krishna!

209
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:56,788
Krishna!” like that, then you are celebrated,
or like a madcap go on, “Krishna!

210
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,318
Krishna!

211
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:02,918
Krishna!” like that.

212
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:13,248
Or else being worse than that is some people
said we’re Krishnas.

213
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:17,918
Like this horrible Rajneesh did.

214
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:21,628
He said He used to make the women naked, so,
“I’m making the women naked.”

215
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:26,508
I started wondering, “When did Krishna make
women naked?”

216
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:34,528
When He was a little boy less than five years
of age, He used to climb up on the trees and

217
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:41,528
the ladies used to take their bath in the
river Yamuna.

218
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:48,188
So He used to hide their clothes just to raise
their Kundalini and see how it works.

219
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:49,188
At the age of five years what does a child
understand?

220
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:59,998
This horrible fellow, was he five years of
age when he was doing this nonsense?

221
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:05,478
Using Shri Krishna’s name like this?

222
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:14,808
And when he used to break the pitchers of
these gopis, what was He doing?

223
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:22,188
He was doing Kundalini awakening, because
the gopis were taking out the water from the

224
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:27,708
river Yamuna which was vibrated by Radha and
He used to break them on the back so that

225
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:35,828
the water would fall on their Kundalini and
they would get their realization, in this

226
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:36,978
lifetime.

227
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:41,588
That’s what’s His purification.

228
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:49,848
But first thing they will do is to separate
Shri Krishna as a child and Shri Krishna as

229
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:54,978
the one who talks to Arjuna, very nice.

230
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:59,918
So there is no relevance and use Him the way
you want.

231
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:14,808
It’s a very common thing that people start
talking about Shri Krishna as if He’s in

232
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:19,918
their pocket, or they are the writers of Gita.

233
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:24,358
Like we have in the churches those bishops
and things who drink a lot and then they take

234
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:35,438
out their Bible and start reading upside down.

235
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:39,438
All these <inaudible > class whether this
belongs to this or to that, all of them are

236
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:49,028
hypocrites of the worst type, just money spinning
people.

237
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:54,688
Even Indian temples which are not far-fetched
are ruined.

238
00:28:54,688 --> 00:29:00,708
All the ganja and all that are sold in Indian
temples.

239
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:12,058
All these popes and all these people are doing
something that is never expected.

240
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:18,768
Imagine they make a kind of a wine called
Benedictine in your Vatican.

241
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:22,988
Can you imagine a nonsensical thing like that?

242
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:35,058
Tomorrow they’ll open a beer bar, I won’t
be surprised.

243
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:42,748
So we come to a position to understand that
all those people who talk of these great incarnations

244
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:48,308
and profess a religion are all hypocrites.

245
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:53,718
There’s no religion.

246
00:29:53,718 --> 00:30:01,888
Simple people who believe these hypocrites
because they’re so simple, so innocent.

247
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:18,068
These cunning, greedy devils who started these
religions, exploited these simple people,

248
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:25,088
used them for making temples, churches, mosques,
they have no religion within them, how can

249
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:28,038
they talk of God?

250
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:33,568
Their life is so impure.

251
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:46,408
So we have to start our own innate religion,
our own spontaneous, natural religion which

252
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:52,698
is the human religion, which is the Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma.

253
00:30:52,698 --> 00:31:06,688
The one that will give you the inner ascent,
not just talk, no hypocrisy; and all that

254
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:20,188
which goes with religion to malign the names
of these great incarnations has to be brought

255
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:27,858
to the light for the people to see this nonsense
that has been eating into our societies, eating

256
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:33,358
into our families, eating into our children,
has to go away.

257
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:48,358
<Sanskrit expression>, whenever the religion
– normally doesn’t mean this nonsensical

258
00:31:48,358 --> 00:32:11,858
religion – falls down, that time, <Sanskrit
expression>, to save the sadhus, the seekers.

259
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:20,268
<Sanskrit expression>, and to destroy all
these devils, “I take My birth again and

260
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:21,268
again.”

261
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:26,088
<Sanskrit expression>, “Every yuga I take
My birth.”

262
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:37,508
And this is what is an incarnation.

263
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:49,458
You must be very fortunate people that now
you can see the cunning of all these devils

264
00:32:49,458 --> 00:33:02,358
and can exist into that purity, into that
benevolence, the hita, which was promised

265
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:05,958
by Shri Krishna.

266
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:10,988
He never told lies, what He told was the truth.

267
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:14,628
He was truth.

268
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:26,898
But those who tried to use Him had to take
course to something which was falsehood, hypocrisy

269
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:38,028
and cunning but that in no way could stop
the truthful people from getting to reality.

270
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,728
May God bless you all.
