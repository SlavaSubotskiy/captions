1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,880
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:31,160
What is attention, what is the movement of attention

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,920
and what are the ways and methods of raising our attention.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,760
Keep it in broad ways. Alright?

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
But when I am saying all these things

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,720
you must know that I am talking to you individually

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,360
– it’s not about others.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,680
Always the first thing human beings do is, when I am speaking to you,

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,720
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,119
This is the best way of putting your attention onto something else.

11
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,852
If you put your attention to yourself that,

12
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,759
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,480
then it will have an effect, because these [words of mine] are mantras.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,400
And that’s why it is wasted

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,400
because whatever is given to you is thrown onto another person.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,640
So the attention, that you have, is the only way to know the reality.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Your own attention is important,

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,560
not the attention of others or your attention on others!

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,000
This must be clearly understood.

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,280
If you understand this point that the whole thing

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,160
is to be consumed by you,

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,320
through your attention to raise yourself to a higher situation,

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,000
it will work out. Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,280
and going to another person who is getting nourished,

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
while you are getting nothing.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,360
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,600
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing it to that person.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,200
So today, as I am going to speak to you about attention,

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,960
you should know that your attention should absorb all that I am saying.

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,440
It is not meant for anybody else.

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,480
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s the best way,

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,000
so that it goes into you. Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
That you listen to me has no effect.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,160
Every lecture will transform you because, after all, I am speaking.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
But because you always think of others

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,160
and you think of your problems all the time

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,280
– something nonsensical is going on, about which you are worried –

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
and the attention is so overloaded

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,040
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go into you.

40
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,120
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive and knowing

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,200
that all these nonsensical things have no value.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,280
It’s your attention that has to come up and has to grow.

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:29,680
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of your being

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,360
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,880
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,640
How much you have gone into it, how much you have discovered it,

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
how far you have raised it is a different point.

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,280
How far your attention has been enlightened is a different point.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,280
But your attention is God

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,960
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
It is like a canvas.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,840
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread out for a film,

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,339
and whatever aptitudes

55
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,160
or, you can say, the drags or movements, your attention has,

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,320
shows on that canvas.

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,880
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’ in English language.

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,520
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone to, or his attention is dragged to

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,160
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like that in English language – vritti.

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,000
Can you suggest any word?

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,760
So our attention is just a pure, completely pure canvas

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,120
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have, to begin with.

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,760
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,400
one from your past, one from your future sense and one from the present.

65
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,440
Now, whatever have been your experiences about

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,600
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

67
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,720
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

68
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,400
For example, if you see the black colour:

69
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,640
all that goes with the black colour is recorded in your memory.

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,680
As soon as you see this black colour, quite a lot of it comes up.

71
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,640
That means, as soon as you see this with your attention,

72
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,000
the attention gets muddled up, or you can say the attention gets coloured

73
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,760
with all the memories about this black colour.

74
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,778
And then your action takes place

75
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,149
according to the way your attention is affected.

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,480
For example, just now something was burned by these flames.

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
Now, all of you became aware of it.

78
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,800
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,440
first thing [that] will happen will be that you will be cautious about it.

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,480
It is not going to happen again,

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,560
but the whole memory will come to you

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

83
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,080
because your attention will become aware of that

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,240
as soon as you will see that, because that canvas of your attention

85
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,640
itself will start throwing out these pictures, out of itself,

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,520
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,560
This is a living canvas.

88
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:47,200
Or may be that if you have got some ideas which you have premeditated,

89
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,160
or thought of, of the future.

90
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,240
For example, you must have thought of somebody that,

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,840
“If I meet that man I will tell him like this.”

92
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,567
As soon as you will meet that man,

93
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:07,320
your attention will start bubbling out with those ideas

94
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,518
that are coming about this man,

95
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,800
and you will start addressing to him accordingly.

96
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,840
It’s all stored up within you,

97
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,480
whether it is about the future or about the past.

98
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,320
It’s given out of the attention through that bubbling process

99
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,880
which depends on your dragging nature, where are you dragged.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,160
That’s called as vritti, but I don’t know what you call it in English language.

101
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,440
I do not know what is the, what you are prone to (tendency).

102
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,960
Vritti is a very neutral word. It doesn’t mean anything bad.

103
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
It means where you are drawn to.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,280
Vritti means a temperament by which you are drawn to.

105
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,520
And whatever is your temperament, it acts like that.

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,040
For example, if you see a man walking, say, blindly

107
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,680
– he cannot see things –

108
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,360
one person may get angry with that person,

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,160
another may have pity for that person,

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,680
third may come forward to help him out.

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

112
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,360
that you have developed through your three gunas.

113
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,600
That’s why this attention becomes identified with you.

114
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:39,000
And when you are identified with this, your vritti, your temperaments,

115
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,800
then you are still in a misidentified area.

116
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,320
Let us take a case of somebody who has been possessed before.

117
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,840
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession goes away.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,640
But the memory remains in the brain that he was possessed.

119
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,720
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person, left side is stronger,

120
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,480
then that memory lingers on,

121
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,880
and as soon as that person comes in contact with anyone

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,080
which has got something to do with the past possession, it clicks.

123
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,320
And the whole thing starts coming into you bubbling out

124
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,040
and you think you are again possessed.

125
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,040
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction]. It’s a myth.

126
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,600
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you are again possessed!”

127
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,480
Because your left side is weak, means you always live in your memory.

128
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,960
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

129
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,703
If you could make yourself stronger than your memory,

130
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,951
nothing can possess you.

131
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,080
But after you get your Realisation,

132
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,120
you are not still identified with that state of mind

133
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,480
in which you see your ego and superego as myths.

134
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Still you get caught up into your ego and superego,

135
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,120
and that’s why your attention is still in a mess.

136
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,440
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent child,

137
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,840
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

138
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,120
means in actual experiencing of something – for a child –

139
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
because he has no memory.

140
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,680
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that this burns.

141
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,360
He has to touch something cold to know that it is cold.

142
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
His memory is not yet built up.

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:15,240
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

144
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,680
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,200
And once the memory is built up stronger,

146
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
the whole personality is affected by memory.

147
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,000
All the conditioning of all kinds come through that;

148
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,880
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can come to you.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,240
You see, sometimes you smell a particular soap,

150
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,880
or say a rose, you smell it –

151
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,680
then all the memories of smelling such a rose, sometimes,

152
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,520
comes to you and you may feel really elated sometimes,

153
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,720
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very unhappy,

154
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
whatever may be the situation.

155
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,160
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

156
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,480
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

157
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,120
has given you a memory.

158
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,880
This memory might have given you a superego,

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,960
or might have given you a ego.

160
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,600
This scanning might have taken place.

161
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,440
If it has been a ego and a superego,

162
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,360
then may be that, if it was ego you must have felt happy.

163
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,280
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very happy.

164
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,280
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are suppressed by this,

165
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,280
then you feel very unhappy.

166
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,120
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

167
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,600
are the states where you are still in the myth,

168
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
still the myth exists. You have to still go beyond.

169
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,520
So if you feel happy about some situation, you should know you

170
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,200
are only happy before Realisation,

171
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,400
because it is giving some support to your ego to bloat.

172
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
And if you are unhappy, then you should know that

173
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,400
there is some sort of a suppression on your ego

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,840
and there’s a superego developing.

175
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,880
So both the situations have been of no help to you,

176
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,400
of no help to you for your growth,

177
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,680
except that both these institutions develop so much

178
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,480
that you are away from the real experiencing.

179
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,360
The real experiencing stops

180
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,680
because your attention is so much muddled up.

181
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,680
So on one side if you move – on the left hand side –

182
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,560
your attention is muddled up with fear, with pain,

183
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:12,600
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

184
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,440
The other side, if you indulge too much on to the right hand side

185
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
– little bit also –

186
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,440
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

187
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,600
The colour of the left side is blue.

188
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,320
And the blue colour starts changing to the black.

189
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,760
While on the right hand side it is, to begin with, yellow,

190
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,360
light yellow or you can say golden,

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,720
then yellow, then orange and then red.

192
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,480
So you go to aggression on the right hand side.

193
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:09,200
On the left hand side you go into a complete state of

194
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
entropy, you can call it,

195
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,640
or a state where you are separated from yourself

196
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,120
into a complete frozen state.

197
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

198
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,240
on the other side you become completely heated up.

199
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,760
Both these things are, again, movement on the wrong direction.

200
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,320
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

201
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,560
– that you keep your attention more in the centre –

202
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:49,480
there also, because it’s a very sensitive point, it doesn’t stay there.

203
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,120
For example,

204
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,200
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for burning the house.

205
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,280
In the same way we can use it for creating smoke.

206
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,960
But we can also use this fire in its proper way, if we use it,

207
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,640
in its proper proportion, for cooking the food [or] for giving us light.

208
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,880
If it is too much, it can burn like a big fire.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

210
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,200
But in the center when you know how to balance it,

211
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,760
then you can use it for your own purpose

212
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,000
– for cooking or for giving light, and then for a puja too.

213
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:50,200
So in the same way when we really balance our gunas properly,

214
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,200
then we become gradually the master of the whole situation.

215
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,840
The attention doesn’t get dragged

216
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,640
into things that we have been doing

217
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,560
or that we have understood through our memories

218
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,200
or through our experiences or whatever it is,

219
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,840
and is not also dragged towards, too much, on the right hand side

220
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,000
that we try to overpower, or try to dominate someone.

221
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,200
Because if you move too much that side you have seen [that] it becomes blood.

222
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,240
It is difficult for people to understand how,

223
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,840
when people become very religious-minded, like now Iran,

224
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,080
the movement is on the right

225
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,440
– all the austerities, all that, everything – now bloodshed.

226
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
Christians also did the same.

227
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,800
Brahmins did the same in India.

228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Buddhists did the same, even [though] they talked of nonviolence

229
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,600
they got to bloodshed, because movement started [on the] right hand side.

230
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,800
Left hand side movement will take you to very sly and dark methods.

231
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,600
So right-handed sided people – like big nations

232
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,880
who are supposed to be developed nations –

233
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
they justify war.

234
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,560
“We must have weapons to face each other.”

235
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,800
But you all, each other, are the same people from God’s point of view!

236
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,280
Why are you fighting?

237
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,279
When God asks you, “Why are you fighting, what is the need?

238
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,560
Why don’t you sit down properly and listen to each other?

239
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,320
What are you fighting about?

240
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,080
You are fighting about land. Is it your father’s land? It belongs to God!

241
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,760
God has created this land. Why are you fighting?”

242
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,720
But your attention is such that immediately you think,

243
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,000
“Oh, this is my land, this is my motherland,

244
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,480
this is my fatherland, this is my brotherland.”

245
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,440
But what about your land which is within you? It’s not your own!

246
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,864
So if you go on telling these people

247
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:04,120
that we should have no war they will not listen.

248
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Realisation is the only way.

249
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,480
By Realisation your attention gets higher

250
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,560
and gets separated from that strata from where these things bubble in.

251
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,360
Do you understand my point now?

252
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,720
The strata goes higher, the attention goes higher, at a higher state.

253
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,680
And these things [Inaudible]

254
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,000
By right side movement you get vikshepa, confusion. First you get confusion.

255
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,400
Every intellectual, whatever brilliant he may be, he is confused.

256
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,040
And the more confused he is, the more he asserts himself

257
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,720
because he is confused, he’s not sure of himself, so he asserts,

258
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
“This is the thing; this is the thing.”

259
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,520
I mean, if it is so, why should you assert it?

260
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,960
But he goes on asserting, “This is the thing!”

261
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
Then understand that now he is going towards lunatic asylum – absolutely!

262
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,800
And the way he asserts, and goes on talking about it,

263
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,680
all the time, that means he is not sure.

264
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,400
He becomes like a possessed personality.

265
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,240
When he explains everything through his brains that

266
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,600
“This is the thing. This is correct. We must all do, this is what…”

267
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,840
and he convinces many others who are confused like him.

268
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,800
They depend on him. He becomes a leader because, you see,

269
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,280
they are much more confused

270
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,360
and they find somebody who is not so much confused outwardly

271
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,880
[so] they stick on to him, and all of them get to war

272
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,160
or some sort of a bloodshed or some sort of – they want to see blood.

273
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,960
They become heartless, passionless, compassionless,

274
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,120
you can say – compassionless, loveless people.

275
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,720
The other movement is the blue side, is like the blue moonlight.

276
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,160
So, for the romanticism starts.

277
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,720
Sitting in the moonlight, you see!

278
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,120
The ideas start coming from Lord Byron (laughter).

279
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,760
And they come into your attention

280
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,840
– then it becomes very strong passion with you.

281
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,000
You think, “Oh, I am still, I have to find out my loves!”

282
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,800
And you go on in search of your loves and this and that.

283
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,440
These things are not really giving joy.

284
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,560
That’s why so many poems have been written that,

285
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
“Love is the most painful thing, it’s worse than death,”

286
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,960
and all sorts of poems are written like that

287
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,360
so why did you get into it?

288
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,920
I mean, it’s already written down, books after books,

289
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,200
still why do you get into it? (laughing)

290
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,440
You are already warned about it that,

291
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,000
“Don’t go after love, love is deception, love is this, that,

292
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,440
it is very temporary, it is for the little while you get that.”

293
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
By chance, if somebody could stop at a point

294
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,440
by marrying somebody who is sweet enough and realise

295
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,280
that love and marriage and all these things are in the centre,

296
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,760
are like the fire in the kitchen,

297
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,000
are like the fire in the temple:

298
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,360
looks after it and doesn’t overdo something about it.

299
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Then maybe that this may be utilized.

300
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,080
In the same way the right side movement of the Sun line.

301
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,600
If people think that, yes, the sun is important,

302
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,920
we have to have sun in the house,

303
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:59,400
but you are not to become naked and insult the Sun and get your skin cancer!

304
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,240
Sun is not for your skin cancer!

305
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,560
But if you overdo it, also it is dangerous.

306
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,640
A person who exposes himself too much to planning

307
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,680
and doing that, and doing this, and doing all this,

308
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,040
can land up into very great difficulties.

309
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,720
So you have to balance that side also

310
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,480
and this side and you have to be in the centre, in the equilibrium.

311
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,680
Now this word ‘equilibrium’ doesn’t exist in our day-to-day life.

312
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,120
It exists only in the fiction

313
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,920
or may be in the so-called scientific research.

314
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,240
But as far as human beings are concerned,

315
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,560
they do not know what is equilibrium is.

316
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,960
Because of this, the attention, though after Realisation

317
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,240
comes up, still on the sides they just go down,

318
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,840
this side or that side according to your vrittis.

319
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,200
And when these identifications still act in them,

320
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,160
they are prone to go down again in their attention

321
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,520
and again start bubbling out the same thing as they had.

322
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,560
Now one has to become lighter in one’s own mind

323
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,640
and should think that, “We have dropped all that now why are we there?”

324
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,840
One should become lighter with all that load flowing out,

325
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,600
because you are here to raise your attention higher and higher

326
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,640
so that you come up to a point

327
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,960
where you become one with the attention of God.

328
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,760
Already your attention is sparkled because through your attention

329
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
you can see what’s wrong with you,

330
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,360
you can see what’s wrong with others

331
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,560
and you can see how far you are going with yourself.

332
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,400
But the progress is retarded because you do not know that this attention

333
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,640
is pure form and all that you get into this attention

334
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,880
is a mythical stuff, is a myth.

335
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,360
If you drop this myth gradually, treat everything as a myth

336
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,680
and not depend on becoming unhappy or happy

337
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,280
– just seeing the thing –

338
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
[then] your attention will take a flight

339
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,080
and it will be at a much higher level residing there.

340
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,400
Instead of that, every moment you go this way or that way

341
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,320
– it goes on like that – and the movement upwards is much less.

342
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,680
Even in Sattvoguna, when you rise,

343
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,240
you can go much worse in that condition also.

344
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,400
For example, if you say that, “I am trying to be Sattwoguni.”

345
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,600
In Sattwoguni it is that you start seeing everything,

346
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,200
discriminating through your understanding

347
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,560
– not through vibrations – through understanding:

348
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:27,760
“Oh! Should we not somehow or the other take out our attention from here?”

349
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,040
“Should we not give up this?”

350
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,040
“Should we be charitable?” “Should we go and serve the people?”

351
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,960
There are people who think, “Oh, we are going to do something great!”

352
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,040
– like your Salvation Army.

353
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Let them be salvaged by themselves!

354
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,800
I don’t know what salvation they are going to do.

355
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,120
So these ideas – ideas, I am saying – of Sattvoguna,

356
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,480
can also immobilise you and can really freeze you down once for all,

357
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,480
and that also can work in you in such a sly manner,

358
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,360
we can say, in such a secretive manner, that you won’t feel it.

359
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,720
All these ideas of helping others, being charitable,

360
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,800
“Let’s have a charity association!” – finished!

361
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,880
Once you work in a charity association, your attention is finished there.

362
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,960
But if your attention goes higher

363
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
– say [as] my attention is. I am only nothing but charity! I mean what am I?

364
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,840
It just flows. You just become the charity.

365
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,033
So the difference between

366
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:42,960
a person who is a realised and a not realised is this

367
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:51,360
that the attention which was giving myth as reality to you

368
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,960
is gone now, is gone higher.

369
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,760
It can see that it is myth.

370
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,400
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

371
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,480
and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself from them.

372
00:29:10,056 --> 00:29:12,786
That, of course, I have to give you a push, no doubt,

373
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:15,080
and I am working hard on that to give you a push.

374
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,000
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped out,

375
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,400
otherwise you will not grow.

376
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,200
All mythical things must be dropped out.

377
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,640
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness

378
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,840
because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

379
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,400
you become thoughtlessly aware.

380
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,840
You have to cross Agya. Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

381
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,880
absolutely you go into a state where you are gunateet,

382
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,920
you are beyond gunas.

383
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,480
So you do not deliberately do anything,

384
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
but it just works out.

385
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,800
But analysis is one of the diseases of the West.

386
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,720
What are you analysing? What are you analysing? You ask yourself.

387
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,240
I feel like laughing at the whole analysis that goes on.

388
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,160
See, they’ll sit down, take out a hair, splitting the hair into hundred!

389
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,200
And great analysers are sitting down there!

390
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,714
They cannot even say how the chromosomes

391
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:24,113
have that spindle action

392
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:29,519
and, I mean at that minute level the things are worked out.

393
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:35,658
They cannot say how a cell divides.

394
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:41,428
What are they analysing sitting down here?

395
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:47,572
Now, they have analysed for a purpose – also done for God.

396
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:51,696
Through their analysis now my things are recorded.

397
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:55,224
Through their analysis I can go to the TV,

398
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:58,726
if they allow me any time, because of analysis [it] doesn’t fit into me,

399
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:03,910
they won’t allow, they may not, it might be expedited.

400
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:06,873
But say, for example, if you had not discovered these things –

401
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:09,313
for example take it like that –

402
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,770
and the science was not discovered,

403
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,457
your attention would have been at least better off.

404
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:25,821
Because of science, your attention is also very much in confusion.

405
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:33,926
So I don’t know which one to praise, whether the science or the primitiveness.

406
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:37,002
When you raised yourself to science also,

407
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,340
you got to another extreme as usual.

408
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,814
Till you burnt out your complete attention, you were not satisfied.

409
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:47,344
I mean if you had kept your balance in science also

410
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:50,068
it would have helped, but the balance was lost there.

411
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:51,963
Give anything to human beings

412
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:56,754
and they know how to make the worst out of it.

413
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,270
They will go to the extreme. You give them a horse, they cannot go

414
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:04,648
ordinary trotting or galloping, they must have a double gallop,

415
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:06,497
till they fall and die!

416
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:11,014
Everything you see, they just are on the run all the time.

417
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:15,566
So first thing is needed is to steady down yourself

418
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:18,443
and tell yourself that, “Now all these mythical things

419
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,682
I am not going to allow to come to my attention.”

420
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:26,005
All these things are nothing but myths.

421
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:30,016
But you are giving too much importance to myths.

422
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:34,476
You are taking them bit so seriously. They are just mythical.

423
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:38,226
Now, I mean, when you are realised now you laugh at people

424
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:44,438
who just go mad over say, a moonlit night.

425
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,747
Alright? But ask the fellow who is doing that,

426
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:52,128
he’ll say, “You are heartless, you have no feelings!”

427
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:57,159
He’ll give you a big poetry out of it.

428
00:32:57,587 --> 00:33:00,998
You go and see anyone of these people who are riding a high horse,

429
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:03,032
who are at the helm of affairs,

430
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,773
and you will feel like laughing at them.

431
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:11,080
But they will think that, “You are useless, you are doing no work,

432
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,584
you are good for nothing, you are just wasters.”

433
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,750
So now for you, because you are enlightened now, is to understand

434
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:28,710
that our attention has to move higher and higher, at a higher space.

435
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,260
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

436
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,408
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

437
00:33:38,604 --> 00:33:46,903
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair, one hair,

438
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:53,667
and that has broken your Sahastrara

439
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:58,496
and now the grace is flowing into you.

440
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,495
But it’s a very small movement that has taken place, of course

441
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:06,813
which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place.

442
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:14,078
Now you have not expanded like this.

443
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:18,300
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

444
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,343
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

445
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:27,277
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t even feel that it is pierced.

446
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:33,507
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

447
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:38,998
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise

448
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:47,594
and your attention, which is in these centers, expands.

449
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:53,695
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides.

450
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:59,576
On every centre we have our attention,

451
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:02,576
which is being enlightened in the centre

452
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:06,075
through this Light passing through.

453
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:11,437
But the Light is too small for the darkness that you have collected.

454
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,257
Specially for the people of the West, I would say,

455
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:19,897
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

456
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:23,437
But still you identify.

457
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:26,274
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How are you?”

458
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,504
Means what?

459
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:33,899
Means you are still confused.

460
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:35,662
Alright?

461
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:41,724
Confusion should go.

462
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:47,226
One confusion was there that, “This is Realisation or not?”

463
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,424
I hope that’s over now with you people.

464
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:52,401
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

465
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:55,785
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised now, you are!”

466
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,101
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box, you see.

467
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,078
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

468
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:03,205
How do you say this is Realisation?”

469
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:07,783
“We expect this out of Realisation and that out of Realisation

470
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:10,623
– that we’ll be flying out of the door if we are Realised,”

471
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:12,543
or something nonsensical like that.

472
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:14,941
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

473
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:20,661
But when we are Realised, there is Light that has come in us,

474
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,006
we have to grow it only by separating our attention

475
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:27,279
from the myths.

476
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,695
It’s all mythical.

477
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,380
I also play with you,

478
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,307
because unless and until you are sure,

479
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:46,521
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself.

480
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:52,614
I want to see how far still your attention is moving,

481
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:57,294
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

482
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,428
still you are not sure of yourself,

483
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:09,784
that’s why the confidence is not there.

484
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:17,125
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

485
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:20,788
There will be five stones put together,

486
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:25,266
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

487
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:28,239
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

488
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,360
And you cannot do it.

489
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,520
Why?

490
00:37:33,863 --> 00:37:38,569
That’s how he makes you a master.

491
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,984
The mastery of your attention

492
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:49,359
will come when you will start seeing that it is all a myth that upsets you.

493
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:52,894
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

494
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,605
Just throw it away.

495
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,045
Just throw it away and understand

496
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:06,129
that you are the eternal attention,

497
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:12,072
that you are the eternal life,

498
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:18,581
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

499
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,601
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

500
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:28,105
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

501
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,672
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

502
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:38,956
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

503
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,138
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

504
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,718
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

505
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,278
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

506
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:57,129
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

507
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,464
because your attention

508
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,925
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

509
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:12,310
I am saying you will, I say you are

510
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,079
already drenched into that bliss.

511
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:21,262
Keep it up.

512
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:25,261
Now, how to do it?

513
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:33,857
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to kill the memory of the past?

514
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:42,978
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

515
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:49,080
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

516
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,789
– always think of it.

517
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:56,284
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

518
00:39:56,404 --> 00:40:00,852
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

519
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:06,966
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

520
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:15,266
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

521
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:22,113
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

522
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:28,249
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

523
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,933
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

524
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:41,254
So the new memories must be built up.

525
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:45,264
If you start building up new memories,

526
00:40:45,384 --> 00:40:48,819
then you will start collecting moments

527
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:58,541
to establish other moments which have such memories.

528
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:03,661
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

529
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:07,702
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

530
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:11,768
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

531
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:15,029
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

532
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,607
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

533
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:26,020
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

534
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:33,037
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

535
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:42,381
you will feel [that] a new wealth

536
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,807
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

537
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:54,153
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

538
00:41:54,273 --> 00:42:00,047
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

539
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,051
and pure joy will remain.

540
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:09,550
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy.

541
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,370
Joy has no thoughts.

542
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:18,996
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

543
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:24,455
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

544
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:31,162
I hope you will understand what I mean by that.

545
00:42:32,893 --> 00:42:34,710
May God bless you all.

546
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:42,782
I think let us meditate today.

547
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:47,231
Maybe this meditation will help us. Please close your eyes.

548
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,087
(break in recording)

549
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:58,742
..all of you, these things, put it on the fire.

550
00:42:58,862 --> 00:43:07,262
Douglas [Fry], take these two, these things, and take them on the fire.

551
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:12,942
(break in recording)

552
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:18,502
…without paying attention here or there or without worrying.

553
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:24,183
Worry and all these things are vikshepas, are all confusions, comes from confusion.

554
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:30,183
You have known about me that I can sit for nine hours in one pose.

555
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:33,703
I mean I have done that but I can do even more.

556
00:43:33,823 --> 00:43:42,081
So one has to develop a baithak, is a sitting posture, for some time.

557
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,374
You must settle down in some position. Alright?

558
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:50,977
Should try to do that, and whatever is required for that is to be done

559
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:53,965
 because that’s the only way you can do it.

560
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:58,436
If you are walking, still your attention will be moving about.

561
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:03,013
Anyway, if there’s a movement then the time, space comes into play.

562
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:09,108
But if you can settle down, if you can have a place where you can sit down.

563
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:11,070
And that’s why the photograph helps.

564
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:14,259
If you can see the photograph continuously,

565
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:18,230
with a relaxed eyes, not all the time staring but relaxed eyes.

566
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:21,683
You can close your eyes with respect [then] again you can open your eyes.

567
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:24,655
This settling down of the position

568
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,417
– you will be surprised how your attention will

569
00:44:27,537 --> 00:44:30,444
gradually rise, you will feel it.

570
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:35,481
Just now you are all in thoughtless awareness so go into meditation.

571
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:39,161
No, if you cannot sit you can take a seat, you see, down below.

572
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:44,124
But as I said it, clothes should be a little lighter.

573
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:48,225
Alright, put your hands towards me. You have to sit for about now, five minutes.

574
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,248
I will not make you [sit] much.

575
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:54,867
But I hope you will develop it next time your sitting.

576
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,893
Right hand on the heart I think will help. Right hand on the heart.

577
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:44,349
Now do it with your heart. Do – it – with – your – heart.

578
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:48,924
Right hand on the heart.

579
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,645
Think within that, “I am the Eternal Life, I am the Spirit”

580
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:27,095
Hold your breath.

581
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:32,695
Leave it.

582
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:46,486
This time when you hold your breath you should know that I am the Mother of the Universe

583
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:51,804
and the most powerful personality.

584
00:47:53,482 --> 00:47:57,317
And I am your Mother and you are all protected.

585
00:47:57,437 --> 00:47:59,449
Hold your breath.

586
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:08,272
Haa! Leave it.

587
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,640
Good.

588
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,157
You are still children I must say.

589
00:48:30,756 --> 00:48:32,517
Don’t you know that I’m very powerful?

590
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:34,116
Have I to tell you?

591
00:48:35,227 --> 00:48:37,032
Even the small children know that.

592
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Alright?

593
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:02,856
Relax.

594
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:09,725
Let’s have some music and something.

595
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:13,639
Now, any questions anywhere?

596
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:21,067
Yogi: I have a question. Could you explain the difference between joy and happiness?

597
00:49:21,187 --> 00:49:22,890
Shri Mataji: Oh!

598
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,612
Very simple you know.

599
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:30,110
Joy doesn’t have a double thing like happiness and unhappiness.

600
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,994
Joy is singular, absolute.

601
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:35,410
It’s absolute. It is thoughtless.

602
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,683
It’s fulfilment.

603
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:41,996
Happiness is always shadowed by unhappiness,

604
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:47,613
is the double coined stuff, double faces of a coin.

605
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:51,863
Happiness will be followed by unhappiness, unhappiness by happiness.

606
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:54,663
It’s a relative terminology.

607
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,825
But joy is absolute, absolute.

608
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,650
It’s beyond thought. It’s bliss.

609
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:04,593
Yogi: It’s more like contentment.

610
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:08,479
Shri Mataji: Contentment can be relative still.

611
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:12,354
But it’s all that in one.

612
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:18,074
Joy is where you do not ask anything anymore, you’re just there.

613
00:50:19,368 --> 00:50:23,899
It just emits then. Just emits.

614
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:29,945
You don’t want anything, it just goes overflowing.

615
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:33,427
It has nothing to do with your rationality,

616
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:36,263
cannot be perceived through your rationality.

617
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:38,534
It’s beyond, you just feel it.

618
00:50:38,654 --> 00:50:40,579
Hmm. Jeremy?

619
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:42,231
Jeremy: Why do we dream?

620
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:44,246
What makes us dream?

621
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:46,546
Shri Mataji: Dreams? Now dreams are you see:

622
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:51,744
there are three stages of our consciousness in the normal way – not the fourth one

623
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:55,997
that, now, you are in the fourth one – but normally there are three stages.

624
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:01,773
And the third stage is called as shushupti,

625
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:07,230
where you are in a stage where you are deep asleep.

626
00:51:07,351 --> 00:51:11,066
That time you come in contact with the unconscious.

627
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:14,213
Unconscious actually enters your attention,

628
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:18,684
and you start getting the information from that.

629
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:24,597
But a person who is not yet realised

630
00:51:24,717 --> 00:51:27,334
is not yet quite awake in that state, in the sense that,

631
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:29,755
whatever he records gets again clouded

632
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,178
when he is coming back through those stages of…

633
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,020
he comes through subconscious areas, lots of areas we can say,

634
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:41,584
that he comes out of all the subconscious areas

635
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:45,174
that he has got within him, and the supraconscious areas within him,

636
00:51:45,294 --> 00:51:46,934
and then he comes to conscious mind.

637
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:50,204
So lots of things cloud it, like covered it,

638
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:53,094
so the interpretation or even the memory of

639
00:51:53,214 --> 00:51:55,588
the dream could be quite confused.

640
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:00,812
But after Realisation you touch even deeper because you enter into unconscious.

641
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,265
Not that The unconscious has to do anything,

642
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,053
but you enter into the unconscious.

643
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:10,053
Your attention goes into the attention and it records what it sees.

644
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:15,379
The more you become Realised, the dream state will go away.

645
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:20,374
For example I never dream. I mean actually I am in dream.

646
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:23,564
I never dream in the sense that when I am so-called dreaming,

647
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:25,779
I am actually there working it out.

648
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:29,037
And I can verify it with others that I was that time with you.

649
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:30,608
He says, “Yes, this happened.”

650
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,928
So, you see, it’s a different state of mine.

651
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:37,584
But actually this happens, you never have a dream, you are always in reality.

652
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:39,940
But that’s a different thing. But at least

653
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:43,731
whatever you record in that from the unconscious,

654
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:45,711
 at least should be your own.

655
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:49,051
But mostly the dreams of the people are clouded,

656
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:52,177
so the dream doesn’t have much meaning.

657
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:57,292
But with Sahaja Yoga you are enlightened so much that,

658
00:52:57,412 --> 00:53:03,789
in your dreams also, you see what unconscious has to say actually.

659
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,324
Which is not confused, which is not clouded,

660
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:09,725
which is absolutely with that you are awakened.

661
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,860
I mean, for example, you might see me, many a times, in dreams.

662
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,065
And suggestions you will get from me.

663
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:19,469
I mean, I work through dreams only, through the unconscious.

664
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:22,664
But some people always will say, “Oh, I have seen you somewhere.

665
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:25,337
I have seen you many a times. I don’t know where I have seen.

666
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,184
Were you in New York?” I said, “No.”

667
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:32,593
“Then where did I see you?” They saw me in their sleep, you see.

668
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:37,452
But they cannot connect that it was in the sleep [that] they had seen me.

669
00:53:37,572 --> 00:53:41,374
They are not Realised people but they have seen me.

670
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,588
Yogini: Can you give people Realisation in their sleep?

671
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:52,067
Shri Mataji: No. No. I cannot.

672
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,831
I do not even want to give Realisation to people

673
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:59,198
when they are not facing me, either my photograph or Sahaja Yogis.

674
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:04,173
That should not be. Because recognition is the only point in Sahaja Yoga.

675
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:10,084
Modern Sahaja Yoga is only going to work out if you recognise me!

676
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:13,963
If you do not recognise me, it’s not going to work out.

677
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,305
This is the only way.

678
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:18,981
This is the only key?

679
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:21,116
Because so far you have never recognised.

680
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:25,392
Only on recognition all your past things will be forgiven, everything will be done.

681
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,778
But if you refuse to recognise me or you go slow with it, your progress will be slow.

682
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:31,693
Which I have told you frankly.

683
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:36,889
Though it’s rather embarrassing job, but I have to tell you. This is a fact.

684
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:39,424
So in dream you cannot give Realisation.

685
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:43,240
But in dream you might see the situation in which will be giving,

686
00:54:43,361 --> 00:54:46,644
how you should give. Your solutions will be suggested to you,

687
00:54:46,764 --> 00:54:49,951
how to approach a particular person.

688
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,940
But you cannot give Realisation to anyone.

689
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:58,380
They have to know that they have got Realisation through Mataji Nirmala Devi.

690
00:54:59,888 --> 00:55:02,982
As it is, when you give them Realisation, they have no value [for it].

691
00:55:03,102 --> 00:55:07,542
If they don’t know me, they will have no value.

692
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:19,991
But I would still suggest that one should not go on analysing the dreams too much.

693
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:21,871
Again the same problem will start.

694
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:24,344
Because I know Jung and all these people did that.

695
00:55:24,464 --> 00:55:28,025
But that was alright at that stage because they were not Realised people,

696
00:55:28,146 --> 00:55:32,317
or they were Realised of a very confused manner,

697
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:34,831
in the sense that they were not sure of themselves.

698
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:37,845
But you people do not go on bothering about dreams so much.

699
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:43,682
The dreams are coming to you to give you a solution of a problem.

700
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,209
The unconscious is helping you in dreams.

701
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:53,594
For example, when I go to India most of them dream that Mother is coming.

702
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:58,836
I mean it acts like television!

703
00:56:05,301 --> 00:56:08,460
Sahaja Yogi: I dreamt of you after the first time I came here.

704
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:14,878
Shri Mataji: After you came here? Not before?

705
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:18,854
But there are people who have come to me because they dreamt about me also.

706
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:23,394
Now that’s a good thing. To dream about me means you’ve gone very deep.

707
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,580
The verification comes in.

708
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:33,218
Sahaja Yogi: When I was here, you put your hand over this eye, when I dreamt about it

709
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:37,052
it was as though something was pulled out of it, like a crystal.

710
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:43,299
 And it fell on the floor and it sort of grew legs and ran away.

711
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:45,964
(laughter).

712
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,050
I used to suffer from headaches and since that time I haven’t.

713
00:56:56,361 --> 00:57:01,509
Shri Mataji: You see! That’s true. That’s true.

714
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,776
I mean, actually it is done like that.

715
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,703
I’ll tell you an example, a very concrete example of this.

716
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:12,315
One man who used to come to Sahaja Yoga and was very deep into it.

717
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:19,852
You see some of the Rajneesh’s disciples wanted to sort of harm him.

718
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:23,646
So they called him and they said, “We’ll offer you a paan (leaf)”

719
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:25,492
– you see, that we eat and all that.

720
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:28,735
And they really mesmerised him and gave him a paan.

721
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:30,533
He ate the paan and all that.

722
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:34,174
That was after the programme, about 10.30 he ate the paan,

723
00:57:34,295 --> 00:57:36,823
and he went into his subconscious areas.

724
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:39,346
But he was coming to consciousness little bit,

725
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:42,502
and then they took him in the taxi and beat him.

726
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:44,222
But they could not beat!

727
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:48,427
He could see that they used to come and beat him and their hands were held by somebody.

728
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,228
Could not feel the beating on him at all.

729
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:53,925
And he used to come to consciousness, again unconscious,

730
00:57:54,046 --> 00:57:55,977
and then he became absolutely conscious.

731
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:59,233
He saw them beating him and they were getting the pain

732
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:02,332
as if beaten but he was never beaten up.

733
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:06,340
And then they left him in one place

734
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:10,988
and then they took out his gold chain, and he had one ring

735
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:13,763
of a real ruby on his fingers, they took out all that,

736
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:16,158
and they left him in one place somewhere.

737
00:58:16,279 --> 00:58:21,335
And he walked all the way from there to his house.

738
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,288
So, I saw all this happening to him

739
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:28,554
and that I was trying to slap, bang these people and all that.

740
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:30,175
I saw all that, I was doing it.

741
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:34,259
So, early in the morning I got up, about six o’clock and I telephoned to his house and

742
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,431
I said that how is he now? His wife said, “He came very late.

743
00:58:37,552 --> 00:58:40,867
I mean he came really in the morning time about five o’clock.

744
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:43,212
And now he’s sleeping.” I said, “Let him sleep.

745
00:58:43,332 --> 00:58:45,402
He has had a very bad time last night

746
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,750
and he suffered a lot and these Rajneesh people

747
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,482
have troubled him a lot,” I told her.

748
00:58:49,603 --> 00:58:52,326
She was quite surprised, she didn’t know all these things!

749
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:56,027
When he got up she asked, “Where did you go?” And he told all the story about it.

750
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:59,414
Then he telephoned to me and he said, “Mother, you were there to save me!”

751
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:02,319
I said, “Alright.” I told him, but normally I don’t tell you.

752
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,634
But that day I just wanted to find out.

753
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:10,402
Then he said that, “I’ve lost my ring that was given to me by my father

754
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:13,380
and I really feel sad about it.”

755
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:17,115
So I said, “Alright you will find it.

756
00:59:17,235 --> 00:59:19,840
Both the things you are going to get it.”

757
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,518
And when he was getting down from the staircase

758
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:29,564
he found a red kind of a bundle lying there.

759
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:32,482
And his wife said, “What is this red bundle lying here for?”

760
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:37,744
So he picked it up. Inside was the ring and inside was his chain.

761
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:39,657
Then he immediately telephoned to me,

762
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:42,466
“Mother I have found both the things, how did you manage?”

763
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:43,657
You see it can be done.

764
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:47,790
So all that was done for them because you see one can work it out.

765
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,710
It can happen like that. But,

766
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:56,863
you must know that everything is done through the power of Brahma,

767
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:59,005
that’s the glow of Adi Shakti.

768
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:03,200
It’s all done through that. The rest is all myth.

769
01:00:05,316 --> 01:00:09,344
If you are not frightened of the myth, and if you do not recognise the myth,

770
01:00:09,464 --> 01:00:13,450
you are above it! But you still recognise it.

771
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,986
This is the problem.

772
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,034
Sahaja Yogi: If you are a scientist say,

773
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:25,035
are you saying that you shouldn’t continue scientific work?

774
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,516
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. If you are a scientist

775
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:32,713
then, after Realisation, what you should do is to bring

776
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:35,067
science and Realisation together.

777
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:38,038
You can explain science and Realisation together.

778
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:40,969
You have to explain Realisation through scientific method.

779
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:45,160
This should be your effort, a new direction, because you have found out that you are Realised,

780
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,664
you have found out that there is All-pervading Power, now, if you can put it

781
01:00:48,785 --> 01:00:51,600
in the scientific language you can talk to them.

782
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,800
So that knowledge is not wasted.

783
01:00:56,669 --> 01:01:01,195
Supposing you are a geologist, you can explain many things of geology

784
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:06,008
which you have not explained so far, through Realisation.

785
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:09,415
So you give actually the science it’s fulfilment itself!

786
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:13,692
There are so many questions they cannot answer.

787
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:28,430
Every thing, politics, everything – why it has failed, what has happened,

788
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:34,706
what is the reason – everything can be explained through science of Sahaja Yoga.

789
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,122
Everything! why it works out, why it doesn’t work out,

790
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:40,182
what’s the thing, what is the failure is

791
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:43,222
– everything can be explained.

792
01:01:43,342 --> 01:01:46,369
Human behaviour, everything.

793
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:55,349
So use your knowledge to enlighten the knowledge

794
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:58,358
 which is covered with ignorance.

795
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:14,734
For example, see now, you have developed films, cinemas, this, that.

796
01:02:14,855 --> 01:02:16,926
Use it for Sahaja Yoga.

797
01:02:17,628 --> 01:02:22,631
How can you use it for Sahaja Yoga you should try to find out ways and methods.

798
01:02:27,428 --> 01:02:30,605
Supposing you are a dramatist: use that drama.

799
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:33,810
Make a drama on Sahaja Yoga.

800
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:51,789
Put your mind to that and you can do it.

801
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:55,475
For example, supposing somebody is doing a course in journalism,

802
01:02:55,595 --> 01:03:00,177
then he should use his journalism for to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

803
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:10,127
You should try to find out in geology also, or in any subject whatsoever:

804
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:16,008
the light of Sahaja Yoga which is being missed so far by the scientists,

805
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:18,699
by the geologists, by the psychologists, by everyone,

806
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:22,485
because it’s all a science which is secluded, which is

807
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:27,590
in darkness, which has no connection with the whole.

808
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:36,399
Now you see your fire is here alright?

809
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:41,382
Now, when I put my hand there, what happens is this fire is enlightened.

810
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:48,943
This power sucks in from you, or any one of you who are Realised-souls,

811
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:55,093
whatever is within you which can be burnt away by fire,

812
01:03:58,077 --> 01:04:00,214
and it burns it off.

813
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:10,617
This fire you have analysed in ignorance but now you are enlightened.

814
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:12,683
I gave realisation in India

815
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:15,766
to some scientists who were working on the agriculture.

816
01:04:15,887 --> 01:04:19,816
They started using vibrations for agriculture

817
01:04:22,295 --> 01:04:27,864
and they were surprised that they could produce ten times more yield.

818
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:30,204
I mean, you can see the difference between

819
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,530
the types of things that are being produced

820
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:35,677
and they are doing tremendous work on that.

821
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:40,474
They’ll be publishing papers and things and they are doing that.

822
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:50,705
You can see also how vibrations work on say a nucleus of an atom.

823
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:54,868
They will be acted through mesotrons

824
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:58,575
If you see that, mesotrons will immediately react to it because

825
01:04:58,696 --> 01:05:01,667
they are arbitrary and you will be amazed you can handle them

826
01:05:01,787 --> 01:05:04,492
and manoeuvre them through your vibrations,

827
01:05:04,612 --> 01:05:08,024
if you see them under microscope.

828
01:05:08,144 --> 01:05:10,197
If you want to go into it you can go into it,

829
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,610
because first of all you have to convince these horrible people

830
01:05:13,731 --> 01:05:18,469
what else could be, and give up everything else

831
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:23,515
and just accept it be within it.

832
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:30,500
We are curing people without any science with us.

833
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,804
We are curing mad people without any science.

834
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,747
After all, everything is for the betterment of human beings.

835
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:40,399
We are improving food problem.

836
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,487
We are improving even material problem,

837
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,750
everybody has got betterment,

838
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:50,270
I mean, Lakshmi tattwa is improved in them.

839
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,493
All these things can be done.

840
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:58,180
And scientists can show that science taken to extreme

841
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,928
can take [us] to destruction, which is not related to the whole.

842
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:08,295
If you move in one direction, a linear movement,

843
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:11,323
it just coils back and comes back to you.

844
01:06:11,443 --> 01:06:15,913
But if you are related to the whole then you know how to balance it,

845
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:19,564
otherwise the nose starts growing or the ears start [growing] – it’s malignant.

846
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:23,650
The growth of science, the modern science, is malignant.

847
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:29,511
Even on Earth, if part of Earth starts growing, for example, on one side,

848
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:34,370
the whole balance and equilibrium will be gone of the Earth, isn’t it!

849
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:40,280
I mean if you see The Nature in its real completeness

850
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,864
then you will see there’s such a balance existing.

851
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:50,714
Science just moves like a blind horse in one direction.

852
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,823
What is the use? Then you go to atom and from atom

853
01:06:55,944 --> 01:07:00,267
you go to atomic energy and from there to the destruction part.

854
01:07:00,754 --> 01:07:04,355
But if you had kept to the truth and to the complete,

855
01:07:04,475 --> 01:07:06,944
then you would not have gone that far.

856
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:10,996
Alright, it’s useful for us, use it.

857
01:07:12,948 --> 01:07:18,733
Analysis destroys you, destroys all our character, everything.

858
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:23,268
If you start analysing you, yourself, you’ll be destroyed.

859
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,341
Take yourself as a whole.

860
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:31,367
There are people I have known who analyse me also.

861
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:34,336
Such silly fools I have seen.

862
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:38,972
Haa, there are.

863
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:50,452
It’s so fantastic, the way human beings go about

864
01:07:51,844 --> 01:07:54,484
with there small little brain!

865
01:07:58,673 --> 01:08:01,929
Anything they cannot explain in Sahaja Yoga.

866
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:08,428
When you have the higher science to discover, forget the lower sciences.

867
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:12,721
I mean, when you were a frog,

868
01:08:13,229 --> 01:08:15,426
you were only worried about the well where you lived but

869
01:08:15,546 --> 01:08:18,742
now today you are a human being, you are worried about other things.

870
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:23,120
Now, if you become a super-human being, you should be worried about higher sciences.

871
01:08:24,985 --> 01:08:30,679
Now what have you achieved through science we can achieve in a second through Sahaja Yoga.

872
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:43,040
Your material welfare can be, in a second we can improve it.

873
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,973
If you get your Realisation, materially you will be better off.

874
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,930
Most of the people they declare as coma and dead

875
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,846
or lunatic and gone cases…

876
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:01,516
they have not been able to cure any lunatic whatsoever.

877
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,997
Once he goes to the lunatic asylum he just comes [out] as a corpse.

878
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:08,566
He never comes back as a sane person.

879
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,393
What your science has achieved so far?

880
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:13,607
And in which way?

881
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:16,907
Take to anything: political problems, anything.

882
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:23,309
You try to have political, say democracy – you have created demonocracy.

883
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:30,159
You wanted to have communism – it is nothing but killing everyone.

884
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,344
Everything is a topsy turvy.

885
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:37,728
Hello! How are you?

886
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:39,454
Come here you come here!

887
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:43,212
You’re daddy has come?

888
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,037
Child: Yes.

889
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,413
Shri Mataji: Where is he?

890
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:46,340
Child: In there.

891
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:51,188
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see, I see. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Good!

892
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:53,991
Now any other question?

893
01:09:54,112 --> 01:09:56,305
Should we have some music?

894
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:05,329
Yogi: Mother, what is the true meaning of your name ‘Shri Bhagawati’?

895
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:08,041
I have seen several different translations of the name

896
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:09,273
Shri Mataji: You see,

897
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:11,729
 entirely different to each other.

898
01:10:14,304 --> 01:10:21,012
‘Bh’ ‘ga’: “Bhaga” means six things all together.

899
01:10:21,559 --> 01:10:25,196
They are the six attributes of God

900
01:10:25,576 --> 01:10:30,738
and Bhagawati is the power of God, that’s why She’s called that.

901
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:33,912
Six basic attributes of God.

902
01:10:38,491 --> 01:10:52,237
First is innocence, second is creativity, third is…

903
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:21,215
fatherliness, you can say, but

904
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:25,798
is the one which nourishes.

905
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:40,907
You see if you put the gardener and the Mother Earth together

906
01:11:41,027 --> 01:11:46,197
then what is the quality of them, is nourishment to grow,

907
01:11:46,318 --> 01:11:49,262
looking after, called as ‘palanhaar’.

908
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:53,186
In English must be a word somewhere.

909
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:56,314
The ‘Patron’?

910
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:01,280
But ‘patron’ doesn’t mean all that, isn’t it.

911
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,268
Yogi: Husbandry?

912
01:12:03,388 --> 01:12:04,644
Shri Mataji: Husbandry?

913
01:12:04,764 --> 01:12:08,444
‘Husbandry’ is a funny word! (laughter)

914
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:14,967
Something like that.

915
01:12:16,161 --> 01:12:17,281
‘Paternal’

916
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,779
Shri Mataji: But it is also maternal, you see.

917
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,186
Yogini: Guardian?

918
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:25,649
Shri Mataji: Guardian is only in control.

919
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:29,748
You see all these things put together is ‘palanhaar’.

920
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,310
Yogi: Sustainer.

921
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,183
Shri Mataji: Sustenance is also there.

922
01:12:36,303 --> 01:12:41,863
But the kindness, the control, the looking after, the weeding out.

923
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:49,194
All the beauties of that and the enjoyment of seeing your creation.

924
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:52,392
The growth.

925
01:12:52,763 --> 01:12:56,065
The One who makes our growth possible.

926
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:08,079
Then He is Almighty.

927
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:10,710
Almighty.

928
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:15,696
Nobody is more powerful than Him. He’s the most powerful.

929
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:29,074
And He encompasses everything.

930
01:13:33,225 --> 01:13:37,709
He’s All-pervading and He knows everything – Sarvarupa.

931
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:42,517
He knows everything, omniscient.

932
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,785
This is ‘Bhaga’.

933
01:13:52,905 --> 01:13:58,883
And Bhagawati is the power of God.

934
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:03,895
Without Bhagawati, God has no meaning.

935
01:14:04,715 --> 01:14:10,053
It’s like moon and moonlight, it’s like sun and sunlight.

936
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:14,618
You cannot differentiate. They are just one and the same.

937
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:18,633
Yogi: Is Bhagawati Adi Shakti then?

938
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:21,984
Shri Mataji: Adi Shakti is the same as Bhagawati.

939
01:14:22,877 --> 01:14:25,355
She’s called by many names.

940
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:28,527
One of them is Nirmala also.
