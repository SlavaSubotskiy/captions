2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,250
For example, we work very hard, think too hard, you are right sided;

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:09,792
to compensate for it,

4
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,834
we take , say,

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:16,042
slipping pills or may be drinks, or something like that,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,792
just to compensate. We can’t bear it,

7
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:20,999
too much on the right.

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,083
But that doesn’t give you help, because you swing

9
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,876
from one end to another.

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:33,334
So, in the center you have to move,

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,584
and for that, there is a special mechanism within us.

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,584
As I told you yesterday, you have to have a very

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,626
scientific outlook, is to keep your mind open.

14
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,959
If it works out, you have to accept as honest people.

15
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,792
We say we are skeptical. All right, but

16
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,959
we can keep ourselves open about it,

17
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,292
that, afterall, we have not reached the absolute truth.

18
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:05,083
So, if you have to reach that truth, what should happen to us?

19
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:10,334
Maybe this is more known to the people in India, maybe,

20
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:15,167
because of their discoveries in the inner world.

21
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,667
But has to be known, even in the West, because,

22
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:21,042
as I told you yesterday, that the tree

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,209
which has grown so big,

24
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,834
has to know his roots.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,209
Otherwise there is always a problem,

26
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,876
which you don’t know how to face.

27
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,250
So, as I have been told you about the roots, now,

28
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,417
about the left side and the right side,

29
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,876
the two sympathetic nervous system,

30
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,083
the left and the right,

31
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,709
both of them act separately,

32
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,709
which I think doctors do not know about.

33
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:53,000
About diabetes, now

34
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,000
- it's too much talking on Me, imbalance -

35
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:05,751
about diabetes somebody asked Me today,

36
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,709
how does he get diabetes by thinking.

37
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,834
In India, if you go to a village,

38
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:25,792
they’ll ask you to take some tea and you just can’t take it,

39
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:29,999
because the sugar is so much, that the

40
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,834
spoon has to stand at right angle.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And none of them get diabetes, none of them.

42
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,459
But our bureaucrats in India, all of them get it.

43
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,292
Also the politicians.

44
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:49,209
The reason is, they think too much, they plan too much.

45
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,626
They are very right sided. Now,

46
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,626
which center does the right side work,

47
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:57,042
is the second center, which we call as Swadisthan.

48
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,584
This second center, which is the Swadisthan,

49
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:04,459
is, as you can see very clearly,

50
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:08,083
provides for right side activity.

51
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:13,209
It is connected, upward passes through the optic chiasma,

52
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,751
goes to the left side,

53
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,125
creating our ego.

54
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:23,999
Like you build this big hall,

55
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,792
so believe that you have done a great job.

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,626
But actually, something that was dead,

57
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,042
that we have put together, that`s how hall is build.

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,501
From dead to dead. We have done no living work so far.

59
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,834
But that creates an imaginary feeling

60
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,083
that we have done this, we have done that.

61
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:50,501
And that's how this balloon of ego starts growing within us,

62
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,584
on one side.

63
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,042
Now, when this Swadisthan is working,

64
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,709
it has got a very important work to do, is to

65
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:11,792
replace the brain’s cells in our head,

66
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,626
which we are using for thinking,

67
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,667
the grey cells. It has to do that.

68
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,042
And because of this pressure of a thinker on that center,

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,584
it neglects the other functions, that it has to do:

70
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,959
of looking after your liver, your pancreas,

71
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,250
your spleen and your kidneys

72
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:41,334
and partly your digestive system.

73
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:47,584
As a result, all this organs go into problems.

74
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:53,751
One of them is the pancreas, which causes,

75
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,999
what we call, diabetes.

76
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,375
Liver goes out of order.

77
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:02,501
When liver goes out of order,

78
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,501
then the heat rises in your body.

79
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,959
From liver it rises higher,

80
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,959
goes upward and catches

81
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,542
on to the right heart center, as we call it,

82
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:19,667
which gives you a disease called asthma.

83
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:24,083
Asthma can be easily cured, if you can look after

84
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:27,083
your over active liver.

85
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:31,751
It becomes over active, because it has very limited energy,

86
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,000
and it has to do its job,

87
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,042
of expelling poison from your body into the blood stream.

88
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:44,584
But it has no energy to do that, so it becomes over active.

89
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,417
And such a person, cannot also,

90
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,751
release all the heat of the body

91
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,626
into the bloodstream, so the heat starts passing over.

92
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:57,501
So much so, that it can reach heart,

93
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,209
and the person can get a massive heart attack.

94
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,709
In the young age, supposing some people,

95
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:09,999
who are playing tennis and smoking -

96
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:13,334
I mean all out to destroy them self in a way, I should say -

97
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:16,000
or some very strenuous games

98
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,751
with that smoking and drinking

99
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,792
and pressurizing themselves, get a very

100
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:24,999
fatal heart attack, a massive heart attack.

101
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:31,042
Because they have gone in a complete out of balance situation.

102
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:37,876
Now, at the same time,

103
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,834
the most dangerous thing

104
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,626
that can happen to us, because of this center,

105
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,042
is that

106
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,709
we get a horrible disease called blood cancer.

107
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,417
Blood cancer comes to us because

108
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,250
of the spleen getting out of order or imbalanced.

109
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,959
The spleen is a speedometer in us, or we can say it`s a,

110
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:08,709
it`s a rhythm keeper; it keeps our rhythm of life.

111
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:11,834
But we are all the time out of rhythm.

112
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,667
You sleep at any time, get up at any time

113
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:20,083
and any kind of emergency that comes in,

114
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,375
this organ has to supply,

115
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:28,626
red blood corpuscles, RBCs , for the emergency,

116
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:33,375
any emergency rises. For example you are eating your food;

117
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,918
and then suddenly you have to run,

118
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,584
then what happens,

119
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,999
that you get pain here in the stomach, this side.

120
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:46,042
Because your spleen has started producing RBCs quickly.

121
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,209
But we are all the time in tensions.

122
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,167
All the time, you are very hectic.

123
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,667
We get up in the morning, first thing we do

124
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:55,000
horrible thing is to read newspapers.

125
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,584
In the newspaper they never give good news,

126
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,584
always has to be something sensational,

127
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:04,292
challenging your spleen.

128
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,000
Then the...

129
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,918
Then the spleen, poor thing, starts

130
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:16,250
excreting or creating more RBCs (red blood cells).

131
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:22,250
And when that happens, the

132
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,000
person who is doing all these things,

133
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:33,334
does not realize that already he has tortured this pour spleen.

134
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,459
Again he goes into another hectic life,

135
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,125
for example he may

136
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,876
just jump into his car, he has to go to his office,

137
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,167
then he sees the jam and then he is very upset

138
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:48,792
because he gets late in the office, then the boss shouts at him,

139
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,792
something like that. All the time there is an emergency,

140
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:56,375
a time bound life. And all the time people are running up and down

141
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:59,792
in a very hectic manner.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,167
And this hectic manner makes this pour spleen really crazy.

143
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,959
Doesn’t understand, what's the matter with this gentleman,

144
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,709
why is he behaving like this?

145
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,918
Then the vulnerability is established.

146
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,626
And anything that happens from the left side,

147
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,792
is just triggers the cancer.

148
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,834
I’ll show you how it works out.

149
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,834
This is one center say

150
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,834
from the left side and the right side,

151
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,501
both of them combine to form the real center.

152
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,334
Now, If you are working too hard on the right side, like that,

153
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,959
it starts moving,

154
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,751
taking the energy, exhausting the energy,  it is like this.

155
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,876
And anything happens to the left, it just goes out.

156
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,459
Now, it's broken,

157
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:54,792
in the sense the relationship with the whole is lost.

158
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,584
So, it gets on its own! It starts working

159
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,250
on its own, we call it a malignant cell.

160
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:08,209
Means it starts growing, in such a way,

161
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:13,667
that there is no relationship with other cells.

162
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,876
Or if the nose starts rising, growing,

163
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,250
then this place all gets covered,

164
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,918
this place all gets covered, your ear can get covered,

165
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,459
and the rest of the cells are still growing at the same rate.

166
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,751
This malignancy is because of imbalance in us.

167
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,042
Even ordinary cancer is cause by that.

168
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,999
So, what have we to do?

169
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,834
How are we to overcome these things?

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,334
Of course, there are doctors and things.

171
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:50,125
Most of them are looking after most of the people.

172
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:56,542
But those who are seeking the truth can be cured by themselves,

173
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,501
because their Kundalini will rise.

174
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,083
When it rises, it nourishes that center,

175
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:07,999
it brings back the broken like this, nourishes them,

176
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,959
she integrates all the centers, so your thinking,

177
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:18,999
your heart, your stomach, your liver, all integrated.

178
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,999
You do not repent for anything.

179
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,709
You get an integrated personality,

180
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,667
you get a very
healthy personality.

181
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,542
And such a person

182
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:35,667
automatically looks very

183
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:39,000
healthy and very peaceful.

184
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,876
Because the centers that are within us,

185
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:46,459
which are enlightened, are the centers

186
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:51,209
which are responsible for different functions in our body.

187
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,999
So the first one I have told you about, the second one,

188
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,918
and the first one I told you about yesterday,

189
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,042
and the next one to that,

190
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,834
is the center which is very important,

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,959
is called as a navel center, Nabhi chakra.

192
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:13,417
This is the one which looks after the solar plexus within us.

193
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:16,876
So, physically we understand this,

194
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:22,042
but spiritually this is a very important center.

195
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,250
Because physically of course, you know the problem of the

196
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:32,792
solar plexuses, but there is another big problem we have,

197
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:35,083
and that is surrounding it,

198
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,918
is the area,

199
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,417
which we call in Sahaja Yoga as “Void”,

200
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,834
which is to be crossed.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,584
Like,

202
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,417
Moses had to make a bridge , sort of a thing it is.

203
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,709
You have to make a bridge.

204
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:55,417
And this bridging comes when this part gets enlighten.

205
00:12:55,918 --> 00:13:00,918
Now, this part is made of

206
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,083
ten valences within us.

207
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,999
Human beings have got ten valences.

208
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,792
These ten valences are like Ten Commandments, we can say.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,584
But they are within us, not without.

210
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,918
Once they are enlightened,

211
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,751
than we rise in our own valences,

212
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,125
means we rise in our nature, as a human being.

213
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,334
So, we become very righteous people.

214
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,959
Like all saints are righteous,

215
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,959
they don’t do anything wrong, they don’t cheat,

216
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,083
they don’t tell lies,

217
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:38,501
they don’t take money, they don’t grab you, they don’t torture you,

218
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:44,918
they are very loving, dynamic, fearless people.

219
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,125
All these qualities, suddenly,

220
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:56,918
manifest in a personality, which receives their Self-Realization.

221
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:02,584
Thus we create a society of wonderful people.

222
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,876
Then we come to another center, which we call

223
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:12,209
as the center of the Mother

224
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:17,083
or Mana, but actually is the Heart center.

225
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:21,792
Heart center in Sahaja Yoga we have three sides,

226
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:27,000
one is the left, is the heart, right heart and the central heart.

227
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:32,834
Now, this is the center under the sternum bone,

228
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,125
and all the antibodies are created in the sternum bone,

229
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,042
till you are twelve years of age.

230
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,250
And then they

231
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,876
go to various areas in the body,

232
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,626
and wait for a signal. This is a remote signal,

233
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:54,667
which comes from the sternum, sternum bone.

234
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,334
Now, those people who suffer from insecurities,

235
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:03,209
especially women, if they suffer from some insecurities,

236
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:07,334
from their husbands, or if their motherhood is challenged,

237
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:12,918
then they develop a very horrible cancer of the breast.

238
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,042
If they are insecure from their husbands,

239
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,417
who are not loyal to them, or some sort of a problem is there,

240
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:26,417
then the women may develop this breast cancer,

241
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:31,167
because of this center, being absolutely dislocated,

242
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,667
due to insecurities,

243
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,501
Whenever we see anything facing us which is dangerous,

244
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:41,792
immediately our sternum bone starts vibrating.

245
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,792
Those vibrations are remotely caught by the antibodies,

246
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,334
and they get ready to fight the diseases.

247
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:53,334
But when the connection is lost

248
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,417
and the cells become malignant,

249
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:00,292
antibodies also get tired fighting it.

250
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,501
So when the Kundalini is passing through this,

251
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,834
this center gets again nourished,

252
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:13,584
and one can achieve a great sense of security within himself,

253
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:19,209
very great sense of security. He feels absolutely secure.

254
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:26,709
Then the same Kundalini rises, up to the center we call as Vishudhi.

255
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,501
This center is the one, which

256
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,792
looks after sixteen things.

257
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,417
You can say ear, nose, tongue, teeth, everything.

258
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,626
They are sixteen things it looks; it has got sixteen petals.

259
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:50,334
Face, eyes, everything it looks after.

260
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,751
But it can also go out of order,

261
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,751
when we go into imbalances about it.

262
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,167
As a result, a person loses many things.

263
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:04,417
But when, you are nourished by it

264
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,501
by the Kundalini, then what happens?

265
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,626
That you just become a witness.

266
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:17,000
You, somehow or other, get out of the crazy world

267
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,751
and you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

268
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,250
Like, you are seeing some drama, supposing,

269
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,209
and then you see Napoleon.

270
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,250
Then you think you are also Napoleon,

271
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,834
and you start really going with him.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,999
But when the drama is over, then suddenly you realize,

273
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,375
“Oh, I am not Napoleon, I am something else!”

274
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:39,501
In the same way, when we are involved in this mad world,

275
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,000
then we are upset.

276
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,417
Say, we are standing in the water,

277
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,042
we are afraid of getting drowned.

278
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,751
The water rises, falls down again,

279
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,876
there is another wave comes and goes down.

280
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:59,792
But supposing, somehow, you get onto a boat,

281
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,542
then you can watch that water,

282
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,999
and if you become an expert swimmer,

283
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,626
you can jump in and save others also.

284
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:12,417
The same thing happens, that you just start

285
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,584
seeing the whole thing like a drama.

286
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,375
Your problem you see as a drama.

287
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:21,209
Now, because you are not in that problem,

288
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,083
you can solve your problem, very easily.

289
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,834
It’s very simple to solve that problem,

290
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,292
because you are not in it. If you are involve in it you are going

291
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,834
into a turmoil.

292
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:35,167
But if you are out of it, you know what is the solution

293
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,709
and it can be solved very easily.

294
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,125
Now, the center that we call as the Agya chakra,

295
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:47,334
which is placed between the optic chiasma, is very important.

296
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,626
On one side, it looks after the pituitary

297
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:54,083
and the other side it looks after the pineal body.

298
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:59,250
Now the pituitary is responsible for controlling this Mr. Ego,

299
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,667
and on the other side we have got superego

300
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,209
which is created by our conditionings.

301
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,792
We have so many conditionings.

302
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,292
We have conditionings of the country where we are born in,

303
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:13,375
we have conditionings in the family we are born in,

304
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,834
our parents and then we have

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
conditionings with the religion we are born in,

306
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,667
and all kind of conditionings we have.

307
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:24,709
All these conditionings make the another balloon,

308
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:29,876
and both of them form a crest on our head

309
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,918
that’s how our fontanel bone area,

310
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,209
which was a soft bone become a hard bone.

311
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:39,042
But when the Kundalini rises

312
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,417
and passes through this center, it sucks in.

313
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:48,083
That's how our karmas, so called, whatever action or

314
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:51,667
wrong things we have done or the wrong conditionings we have,

315
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,250
everything gets sucked in

316
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,209
and it opens like a petal.

317
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:01,209
The limbic area, that is between, opens

318
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,334
and the Kundalini passes through,

319
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:05,959
pierces through your fontanel bone area

320
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:10,042
and you start feeling the cool breeze out of your head.

321
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
You are surprised how it happened.

322
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:16,417
And then you can feel it all around you is cool breeze .

323
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,209
which is the All Pervading Power.

324
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,375
As a result that you become one with this,

325
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:26,626
all the time the energy is flowing through you

326
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,417
and though you may going into imbalances a little bit,

327
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:32,375
but you come to balance in no time.

328
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,334
This is as far as the physical side is concerned.

329
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,167
Mentally you feel perfectly all right,

330
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:43,709
but above all, you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

331
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:47,959
which we call as “collective consciousness”.

332
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:53,959
Collective consciousness about which, Jung has said lots of things.

333
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,918
Collective consciousness is where you can feel the centers of others

334
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,999
on your fingertips

335
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:05,167
and also you can feel your own centers.

336
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,292
And if you know to correct yours and then of others,

337
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,209
you can easily manage the whole thing.

338
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,751
So this collective consciousness is the one, is the new awareness,

339
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,918
a new dimension, which one has to achieve.

340
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,167
This is the new birth,

341
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,626
or we should say, the second birth, as we call it.

342
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,709
In Sanskrit language

343
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:35,834
is called as, a person who is

344
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:41,667
a realized soul, is called a “dwijaha”, means born twice.

345
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,417
And a bird is also called dwijaha, because first is an egg

346
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:49,667
and then it is born as a bird, a free bird.

347
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:54,959
In the same way, a person who is a realized soul has a second birth.

348
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,083
As they say, ”You are to be born again”, it happens.

349
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:01,417
But it is actualization, it is not just a certificate.

350
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,709
Anybody can take a certificate, ”I am this, I am that”,

351
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,417
that makes no difference.

352
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:10,209
Because you must have the powers, of what you are.

353
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:13,918
If you are a human being, you have, you have human powers.

354
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,334
In the same way, if you become a realized soul, super human being,

355
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:22,459
than you must have the powers of a super human being.

356
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,292
If you don’t have these powers, it is no use

357
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,042
giving a false certificate like that.

358
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,292
Same as I told you about religion,
when somebody asked Me the question,

359
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,000
that why are they fight
in the name of religion?

360
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,792
Because it's man-made.

361
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:41,584
Saints never fight. They never fight.

362
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,999
They love and they understand each other and they know the Absolute.

363
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:52,209
So, when your Spirit, which is in your heart,

364
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,334
has the seat here

365
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:59,751
and it gets connected with your attention,

366
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,918
then the light of the Spirit makes you an enlightened person,

367
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:08,999
and in that light, you know what is right and what is wrong.

368
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,876
What is good for you, what is constructive and what is destructive.

369
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:17,584
The power of Spirit is,

370
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:21,250
that of course it's a collective being within us, no doubt,

371
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:24,417
also we say that we are part and a parcel of the whole.

372
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,167
But we are not.

373
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,834
Once you become collectively conscious,

374
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:31,918
then you are only part and parcel of the whole.

375
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,042
Then you become

376
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,542
the source of joy.

377
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:43,000
Spirit is the source of joy. You become joyous,

378
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,834
you are full of joy.

379
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:48,542
Joy s not double-faced,

380
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,751
it's not like happiness - unhappiness.

381
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:55,501
It's a permanent state of enjoyment.

382
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,999
And, you know the absolute truth.

383
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,209
On your fingertips you can know. Even in the Koran, as I told you,

384
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:07,209
in the Koran it is said that, “Your hands will speak

385
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,459
at the time of your Resurrection,

386
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,000
and they will give witness against you”.

387
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:16,000
So, this is the time of your Judgment, Last Judgment,

388
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:20,083
when your Kundalini is going to tell you, where you stand.

389
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,918
And once you correct yourself, you enter into the Kingdom of God.

390
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:31,542
This has to happen. It's nothing artificial about it, is all

391
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,918
living process

392
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:38,375
of a living energy, which works

393
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:42,667
and you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for it.

394
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,834
This is the only snag, if there is anything.

395
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,584
So may God bless you all.

396
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:53,250
Yesterday we spent lot of time asking questions and answering,

397
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,542
I don’t mind a little bit of that, but not too much...

398
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,459
Yesterday we had too many questions and answers.

399
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:04,125
So, if you could ask Me some questions, is all right.

400
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:07,792
But should be relevant. Because you know, I’m not here

401
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,459
to get anything out of you, is just to tell you what you have,

402
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:14,083
to give you what is yours.

403
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:18,167
It all happens because of your energy.

404
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,000
I have nothing to do with it in a way.

405
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:27,417
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

406
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,918
Q: Could you tell something about the nadis?

407
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,709
SM: Nadis... You didn’t tell them?

408
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,751
He told Me he has already talked to you!

409
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:53,125
The left one is known as the Ida Nadi,

410
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,667
which get us to the left side.

411
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:59,999
The right one as the Pingala Nadi, which gets us to the right side.

412
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,999
The central one is known as the Sushumna Nadi.

413
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:07,042
Also, there are a many other details about it,

414
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,999
which once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know a lot of.

415
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,417
It's too much really, because I must have given at least

416
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,792
three thousand to four thousands lectures,

417
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,501
in English language itself,

418
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:22,959
and they are all on the tape, you can always listen to them.

419
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,584
Knowledge is like a vast ocean,

420
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,626
and the source of knowledge is your Spirit.

421
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,501
So, once you are realized,

422
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:35,709
you will be able to understand everything.

423
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:54,918
Q: What happens when a huge amount of energy comes out of here

424
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,417
and manifests himself in forms of pictures?

425
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,667
Is, is a,

426
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,876
that means this center is broken.

427
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,918
Is not all right.

428
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,626
You shouldn’t see anything.

429
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,792
You shouldn’t see the light. You have to be the light.

430
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,584
If I see the light, then I’m not the light!

431
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,375
All right?

432
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:32,709
Q:How much influence does food have on the collective consciousness?

433
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,792
SM: - What has... ?
P: - Food.

434
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:41,834
Food... You see, is food, food we deal with in such a manner,

435
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,542
that whatever is deficient in a person,

436
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:49,709
whatever is complementary in a person, should be eaten.

437
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:54,709
Like, you have to,

438
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:58,751
supposing, you people are very right sided

439
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,459
then you must take to carbohydrates;

440
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,999
but if you are left sided, then you have to take to proteins.

441
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,292
But very big animals than human beings are not to be eaten,

442
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,250
because their muscles are very big,

443
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,667
and they cause troubles to your teeth and things like that.

444
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:22,417
But food becomes the secondary thing,

445
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,876
after you have had the ambrosia of Realization.

446
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,667
It is no so important.

447
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,584
Just don’t bother too much about food, at all.

448
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,876
SM: What  is he saying?

449
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,999
Q: How the people balance?

450
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:24,000
Individually, everybody has a different set of problems.

451
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,667
How does each individual balance ?

452
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,417
Bring them back to the balance.

453
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:33,459
SM: I mean, first is, of course, individual balance,

454
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,209
and when you are individually balanced,

455
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:41,792
then when you are the Spirit,

456
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,083
then it's a collective consciousness.

457
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,501
In that the Spirit gives you

458
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,751
an absolute nature.

459
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,999
And everybody being absolute

460
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,999
there is no problem of balancing with anyone else.

461
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,501
You just enjoy each other. That's all.

462
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:01,000
Only you are dressed up differently,

463
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:04,999
you comb your hair differently. That doesn’t matter.

464
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:10,000
That’s all outside. But inside you enjoy each other.

465
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,417
There is a beautiful

466
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,876
thing said about one poet

467
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:20,250
Namadeva - yesterday i told them about that one, no? -

468
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:25,792
about Namadeva, who was a tailor, just a tailor.

469
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,334
And he went to see another realized soul,

470
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:33,000
another saint, in another village,

471
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,292
who was a potter.

472
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:40,334
And the potter was needing the clay with his feet

473
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:43,334
when this Namadeva went there.

474
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,584
And he went and he stood, stand.

475
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:51,042
And he said, a beautiful poem he has written,

476
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:54,876
that, „I came here to see

477
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,250
the formless", means the vibrations.

478
00:30:58,501 --> 00:31:00,792
"I came here to feel the vibrations,

479
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:03,792
I came here to see the formless,

480
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:06,751
but the whole formless is in your form!”

481
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,626
What an appreciation, what an enjoyment

482
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,709
and what endearment it creates.

483
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:15,876
I mean, we human beings never talk like that, you see.

484
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:21,751
When we talk to each other is so artificial and can be very

485
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:25,209
selfish , can be very skimming and
can be anything. You just don’t know.

486
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,834
If somebody says, ”Thank you” to you, you often start thinking

487
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,834
”Why, what did I do?”

488
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,959
Or somebody says something bad about you,

489
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,918
”You should know I've done nothing good for him,

490
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,334
why is it saying bad about me, I don't know”,

491
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,250
is like that, you see, is not that.

492
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:44,292
It’s absolutely clear cut.

493
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,959
Cristal clear temperament you get, absolutely.

494
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:52,209
You become crystal clear and the other person is also crystal clear

495
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,501
and they are just enjoy each other. That`s all.

496
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,083
We have never enjoy each other.

497
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,792
Actually we have never used the Power of Love,

498
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,751
we have always use the power of hatred.

499
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,375
Anything that you want to do,

500
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:06,167
you have to put some sort of an issue to fight.

501
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,042
Here there is no such question.

502
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,042
Such a state we all should have,

503
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,459
for the emancipation of humanity,

504
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:18,626
for the emancipation of our country,

505
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,042
all the countries, all over the world,

506
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,292
for our children and for ourselves.

507
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,834
- Yes Sir ?

508
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:41,000
Q: What happens to Kundalini, whether a major accident,

509
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,999
or some injury to this area?

510
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,584
SM: We have to correct it. If it's physically very much injured,

511
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:51,125
it can be corrected. There is no such problem.

512
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:55,042
Yes, please.

513
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:18,000
Q: Everything in creation isn't it connected,

514
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:22,667
therefore couldn't there be

515
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:29,250
could it be possible that free choice is actually Maya?

516
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:42,667
SM: You have free choice to know it’s Maya.

517
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,709
You have to reach that point.

518
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,000
Otherwise you will never accept. You see, you are a human beings.

519
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,209
If you are told anything you'll never accept it.

520
00:33:56,417 --> 00:34:00,083
So it's better to reach that point, where to feel that is all

521
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,626
sort of illusion.

522
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,375
And then you discover it.

523
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,584
You have to have that much free choice.

524
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,876
You are made that way.

525
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:18,042
And such a choice is to be accepted, to be respected.

526
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,334
Q: Kundalini is such a strong force.

527
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:41,250
Now, what happens when it doesn’t actually achieve a connection?

528
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,834
SM:In Sahaja Yoga we'll see that it reaches that  point.

529
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:50,417
But it is a force like.

530
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,876
In a seed there is a primule.

531
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:59,083
And the primule first just sprouts

532
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:03,334
then a little plant it becomes,

533
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,209
gradually it becomes a very big tree.

534
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:09,626
And out of that tree, thousands of seeds coming.

535
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,918
So, in that little bit of that seed,

536
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:18,959
there are the maps of all these creations.

537
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,375
In the same way, that Kundalini is a force.

538
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:27,876
Supposing it rises and it reaches the apex also

539
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,584
and is not established,

540
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:32,250
then we have to remember the parabola of Christ,

541
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:37,000
that, ”Some of the seeds fell in the marshy land and got lost”.

542
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:41,083
Then again they take birth, then again they work it out.

543
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,501
So, best is getting done, once for all.

544
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:49,292
The time has come, is the blossom time, better have it done.

545
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,918
Q: Perhaps now would be the time.

546
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:58,083
SM: Of course. Perhaps now it is, it is the time.

547
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,375
Yes, please.

548
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:25,334
Q: Can any yoga balance the mind?

549
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,709
SM: Cannot.

550
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,334
Any other yoga is a part and parcel of the same.

551
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:35,334
Actually, they have separated.

552
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:40,999
They have taken out one part of yoga, one part of yoga there.

553
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,709
It's a, if you see the Patanjali Yoga it is Ashtangas,

554
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:47,125
means there are eight full.

555
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:51,584
And basically is dealt with the ascent,

556
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,999
with the thoughtless awareness, which are Nirvichar Samadhi,

557
00:36:56,209 --> 00:37:00,083
and then with the doubtless awareness, which has to be achieved,

558
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,751
and that is only through the Kundalini awakening.

559
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:07,999
Also, he has suggested some exercises that have to be done,

560
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,834
if it is necessary.

561
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,334
When the Kundalini rises, we know what the problem is,

562
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,792
and we can do the exercises.

563
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:19,417
And so, all the yogas are included in Sahaja Yoga.

564
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:23,042
When the Kundalini rises, then it goes into Raja Yoga,

565
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,834
in the sense that one center augments,

566
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,834
when the Kundalini is passed through that.

567
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Supposing the Kundalini has come out of it,

568
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,167
then it has to close,

569
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,042
because it has to stop the Kundalini.

570
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,459
Then it passes through another, then it has to close again.

571
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,334
All these is called bhandan.

572
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:42,667
But this is not to be done outside.

573
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:45,083
It is to be done by the machinery itself

574
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,751
which works spontaneously, automatically.

575
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,999
Yesterday I told you, as the car starts,

576
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,834
all the machine starts working.

577
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,918
But without starting the car, if you start moving the wheels,

578
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,000
what will happen?

579
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,876
Q: How this period that we are living in now,

580
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,667
be viewed from the future?

581
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:19,999
SM: Viewd from the future? Is the excellent time, the best time.

582
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:23,918
And then we are not thinking of future or of past.

583
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,250
Once we enter into that, then we just enjoy the present,

584
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:30,959
which we have never enjoyed. Because future doesn’t exist.

585
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,083
The past is over. We have to be in present.

586
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,167
So we establish ourselves in present

587
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,751
and enjoy every moment of it.

588
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:45,709
Future is just our imagination, idea.

589
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,292
Q: Can one person release the energy for another?

590
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:01,626
SM: Of course. That’s what I said.

591
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:05,000
One enlighten person can enlighten another person.

592
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:10,584
Q: Through the method of Shiatsu?

593
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,709
Shiatsu.

594
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,292
SM: No, there is not such a thing. Only under your hand.

595
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,834
You can move it. It moves through your hand.

596
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:23,292
Just if you move like this, you can do it.

597
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:24,959
As simple as that.

598
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:29,292
It has to be simple. Because it is so vital.

599
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:44,000
Q: Krishnamurti doesn't believe this,

600
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:48,459
he believes that the health can come to you...

601
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,999
It has to come to you.

602
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,334
SM: You see, Krishnamurti has said too many things.

603
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,792
Talking is not the way,

604
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:12,501
it is the actualization, is the becoming.  That is important.

605
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:15,209
So many books have been written. I tell you.

606
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:18,959
Even you see the books, one goes mad the way this is written

607
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,000
and really people are wondering, "What is what? What is what?"

608
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,042
Who want to go? What to do?

609
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,999
Actually, it's the actualization.

610
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:30,459
It's the actualization that is important.

611
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:35,250
Q: Should I ask You, now is the time for that actualization?

612
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,292
SM: Yes, of course.

613
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:42,042
It's all right. There's one lady there. Yes, madam.

614
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,209
What is she reading?

615
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:24,167
What is it?

616
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,000
I can get few words.

617
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:01,334
Q:I think I got the message now.

618
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:05,876
Mother the lady is asking a question as to,

619
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:09,584
she is wondering whether the awakening of Kundalini

620
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:12,292
can in fact be dangerous? She's red a number of books where...

621
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:15,918
SM: Yes, yes, is correct. That I should have covered already.

622
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,918
It is not dangerous at all. At all.

623
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,834
You see this books are written by people

624
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,626
who are absolutely unauthorized.

625
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,125
Have they raised anybody's Kundalini? They have not.

626
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,459
But, just, just a moment, sit down, sit down.

627
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,584
You see, this job is to be done by

628
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:33,417
somebody who is authorized by the Divine.

629
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,501
Every Tom, Dick and Harry can not do it.

630
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,626
You see, when you put, supposing aplug into the,

631
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,501
you put your hand into the plug

632
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,709
and say that electricity is dangerous,

633
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:45,667
because you don’t know what plug is.

634
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:48,751
You have to know it. If you know it, you can do it.

635
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,876
Is not, this is all modern, is all modern I think,

636
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,584
is more 20th century knowledge that has come up.

637
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,667
None of the old books have written such a nonsense like that.

638
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,083
This is just to frighten people

639
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:02,250
so that they don’t gate their Realization, is the point!

640
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,250
She is your Mother.

641
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,209
Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother

642
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,292
and She knows each and every thing about you.

643
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:14,834
Not only that, but She is such a loving Mother,

644
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:17,000
that She gives your rebirth,

645
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:21,417
without even you knowing about it, till you realy feel it.

646
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:23,834
It’s so wonderful!

647
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,209
Now, your mother, when she gave your birth,

648
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,751
she took up all the labor pains upon herself.

649
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:32,626
In the same way, now we have thousands of people

650
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,751
who got Realization.

651
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,250
Nobody felt anything bad except sometimes you do feel little heat,

652
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:40,417
that's all. Thousands of people.

653
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,292
But the people who have written that, is all modern style.

654
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:46,626
On the contrary, there was

655
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,918
a great saint called Ramadasa,

656
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:52,209
at the time os Shivaji. He was the guru of Shivaji.

657
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:54,918
Was a very well known king of Maharashtra.

658
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,375
And somebody asked him that,

659
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:00,000
“How much time takes does it take for a Kundalini to rise?”

660
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:03,709
So he used a Sanskrit word means tatkshana, means that moment.

661
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:07,834
But the person who has to do it has to be authorized,

662
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:11,876
and the person who has to take it, must desire it!

663
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,459
That is the word used.

664
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,083
This is all modern nonsense that has come up to sell books.

665
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:20,125
That's all I think. Or some of the people, who have no authority,

666
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,375
those who led a very funny life.

667
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,792
I know of someone who has written a funny book about Kundalini,

668
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,834
who has a very bad life of his own,

669
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:33,918
and he says that, "I got such a shock, I got this, that". Naturally.

670
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:37,334
You had no business to enter into an area,

671
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:39,751
where you are not authorized.

672
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:43,999
And if so, also you should have gone to somebody who is authorized.

673
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:48,209
The authority has to come from the Divine, that’s important.

674
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:57,083
Q: Who is your guru he is asking?

675
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:01,125
I am my own guru and I’ll make you your own guru.

676
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,167
You don't have to go to any guru, anymore.

677
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:12,167
You become your own guru. When the Atma, the Spirit comes into you,

678
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,999
then you don’t need any guru. Why do you need?

679
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,792
Of course I can give you guidance

680
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:21,918
and at the most, you can call Me, The Mother. That’s all.

681
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:26,667
There is no need to be subservient to anyone.

682
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:30,209
There is no need to pay anyone. Of course, not, you cannot pay.

683
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:33,000
Anybody who takes your money is your servant,

684
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:35,209
a man has no self respect.

685
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:39,042
He takes money from you for God, how can he?

686
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:45,000
And we also, very foolishly, give money to such horrible people,

687
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,792
who are just devils!

688
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:51,584
They are evil geniuses.

689
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,167
And the way they have managed this,

690
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:57,959
is they have realy made so many people so very sick,

691
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,999
that sometimes, I do not know,

692
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:04,709
where are they going to land up, the way they have been.

693
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:07,792
How madam?

694
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:13,751
Q: Can You give us some person, can You give us somebody

695
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,792
individually, when You say this?

696
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:18,125
SM:Most of them are in the market.

697
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,918
They are in the market.

698
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,501
I need not take their names, at this auspicious time.

699
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:26,000
Horrible people.

700
00:46:28,626 --> 00:46:31,042
Yes, madam?

701
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:42,292
Q: Is being over-emotional concerned with thinking?

702
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:45,501
SM: More emotional...

703
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:47,999
Q: Is over-emotional, she is saying.

704
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:51,083
SM: Yes, you see, both ways one thinks.

705
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,417
Over-emotional people also think

706
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:56,667
and those who are not emotional also think.

707
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:59,667
This is no question, it acts on both the sides.

708
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:02,667
The emotional people think of the past, "Oh, I was so happy,

709
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:06,167
now I am so unhappy", sort of a thing, you see?

710
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:11,709
And the people who are not emotional

711
00:47:11,918 --> 00:47:15,042
think how to make others unhappy?

712
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:39,709
Q: How does what You are talking about line up

713
00:47:39,918 --> 00:47:43,292
with what is written in the Bible, about salvation?

714
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:45,667
SM: About what?
Q: Salvation.

715
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:48,709
SM: Same thing it is Madam, is the same thing.

716
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,250
Absolutely, Bible can be only explained through Sahaja Yoga.

717
00:47:52,584 --> 00:47:55,083
Gita can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

718
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,250
Koran can be explained only through Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,792
You have to read between the lines.

720
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:02,334
Christ was given only three, four years.

721
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:05,626
What is three, four years to explain anything?

722
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:08,417
People were so cruel.

723
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,250
You know, I was in London,

724
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:12,792
four years I was struggling with seven hippies.

725
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:15,334
Couldn't give them Realization, it's so horrible.

726
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:18,125
What could He do in four years?

727
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,792
It’s not an easy thing to work it out.

728
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,542
Q: Is Kundalini the only force in this particular time,

729
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:46,334
that will do this particular job?

730
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:50,459
SM: No, all the time this was the force, all the time.

731
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,626
It's all the time, this was the force.

732
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:55,918
It’s called also, in the Bible it is said,

733
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,501
that about the tree of life, is this mechanism.

734
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:03,876
Also said that "I'll appear before you as tongues of flames"

735
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,417
is the, the, when the Kundalini rises,

736
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:08,334
then your centers look like that.

737
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,751
So many things there are even in the Bible.

738
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:13,459
In everything, in Koran it is called as Asas,

739
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,959
the names are different, but it is so.

740
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:22,626
Like Tao is the Kundalini. Tao as described, is also Kundalini.

741
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,083
Zen system, Zen also means the same.

742
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:27,125
Dhyana is the same thing.

743
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,959
Confucious talked of the same thing,

744
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:30,999
Socrates talked of the same thing.

745
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:33,834
But only thing, is not said so clearly,

746
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:37,000
because there were not people intelligent as you are today,

747
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:40,709
to understand it, I think, that it was not said so clearly.

748
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:45,083
Today we have so many seekers, can you imagine? So many seekers.

749
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:46,834
The world is full of them.

750
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,501
And they are intelligent, they have understood

751
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:53,584
what is Divine, they try to understand.

752
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:56,459
Is a very different category of people.

753
00:49:56,667 --> 00:50:00,334
As William Blake has said: “These are men of God”.

754
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:04,209
They will find God and they will make others men of God.”

755
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:06,626
It's very clearly he has said it hundred years back.

756
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,083
So, that is what it is.

757
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:11,042
And it is all, also in one of the Nadi Granthas,

758
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:15,792
which was written by Brighu Muni, who was the originator of

759
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:19,667
the horoscopes and all that, astrology.

760
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:22,417
He has written very clearly that this is going to happen

761
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,876
and this year specially is something

762
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:29,876
according to the calculations, seems to be a big explosion.

763
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:37,292
It's just like that.

764
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:04,501
Q: Even in somebody who is severely injured like in the spinal cord,

765
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,459
can Kundalini be raised?

766
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,999
SM: Yes can be. Can be, most of the people do get it.

767
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,334
If somebody has to much of problems then

768
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:16,459
than it maybe that, it may little bit trouble,

769
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:18,042
but one can correct it.

770
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,250
It's, you see, the generosity of Divine is such,

771
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:25,250
that He tries to give it to everyone.

772
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,667
So much, that I'm Myself amazed.

773
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:30,792
It doesn't consider anything else.

774
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:33,999
Just like a big

775
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,167
whirlwind it comes, just.

776
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:43,292
I am Myself surprised how people get Realization.

777
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,999
Where, like people,

778
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:50,667
in Russia I was telling you yesterday. Then I went to Bogota.

779
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,042
They have never heard about Me,

780
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,334
nothing of the kind, and thousands were there.

781
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:57,209
They all got Realization. Very surprising.

782
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,417
I was so surprised.

783
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,417
It's something is there

784
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:07,125
in the generosity of the Divine that it's working out.

785
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:13,709
And is better that we all get drenched into that.

786
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:25,083
All right. So we'll have the process of Realization.

787
00:52:25,918 --> 00:52:30,125
Just to remove your doubts, I talked to you and allowed you to

788
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:33,667
ask Me questions and allowed lot of time for it,

789
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:38,626
because you see, when you are going through that process

790
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,501
I don’t want your mind just to come like a jack in the box,

791
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:46,667
to say something. So is better to keep that mind little bit silent,

792
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:49,083
I said, "All right, you can ask Me questions".

793
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,125
But these questions, whether I answer them or not,

794
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:54,292
or whether they satisfy you or not,

795
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:56,999
whether you ask questions or not, makes no differences.

796
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:59,250
Because this is all mental feats.

797
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:02,167
It is beyond the mind, Kundalini takes you.

798
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,584
So, what important thing is, that you must desire

799
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,334
to get your Self-Realization.

800
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,999
If you do not desire it,

801
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:11,459
if you do not want it, I cannot force on you.

802
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:15,792
This is the biggest problem. You cannot force on anyone.

803
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:18,834
You have to desire it and ask for it, humbly.

804
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,417
If you are saying, that,

805
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,292
"No, I won't have it". So, I would request you

806
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,334
that you better go and not disturb others.

807
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:32,667
Because is something that cannot work against your free will.

808
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:36,876
That’s the free choice, as you say. Is that is the free choice,

809
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:40,083
that till that point, you have a free choice

810
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:43,250
whether to ask for it or not.

811
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:48,584
Now, there are two conditions, as I told yesterday.

812
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,417
The first one is that,

813
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:54,876
we have to forgive ourselves fully.

814
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:58,167
We are not to feel guilty, at all.

815
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,292
Absolutely, we are human beings,

816
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:02,999
and human beings are the only ones who commit mistakes.

817
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,709
Gods are not going to commit mistakes.

818
00:54:05,918 --> 00:54:09,792
So, if we commit mistakes, doesn’t matter.

819
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:15,417
But as I told you, the generosity and the forgiveness

820
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:18,792
of the Divine is so tremendous.

821
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:23,375
that whatever you have done wrong, is easily forgiven.

822
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:28,501
Divine is anxious that you should get your Realization.

823
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:31,125
Very anxious.

824
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,250
So, you don’t now put down yourself,

825
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:36,501
by saying, "I am guilty, I've done this,

826
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:38,834
I've done that or I've committed sin.

827
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:41,542
These ideas should not come into your head at all.

828
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:44,959
There is nothing like sin, when you are in the present.

829
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:48,959
So forget the past and forget what you think you have done wrong.

830
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:53,626
Also you have to forgive the people, all the people, in general.

831
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:56,709
Not to remember whom you have to forgive, why you have to forgive,

832
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,792
but just in general you just forgive.

833
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:01,626
It's such a great relief you don't know, if you will forgive.

834
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:04,042
This Agnya chakra just releases.

835
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,292
If you just say, "I forgive everyone", it opens out,

836
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:11,209
and it's so good, that once

837
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:13,667
you have forgiven, then Kundalini just shoots off.

838
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:17,167
But most of the time I have seen, when they come to Me, meet Me,

839
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,626
Then I have to tell them, “Please forgive, please forgive,

840
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,834
please forgive” and then it works out.

841
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:26,626
It makes it easier, just you, just forgive everyone.

842
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:29,417
As it is, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

843
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:32,626
you don't do anything, do you? Nothing.

844
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:36,292
What happens? It’s just a myth.

845
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:39,042
Just a myth. But if you don’t forgive,

846
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,250
then you play into wrong hands.

847
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,999
The other person, who has troubled you or tortured you

848
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,918
is quite happy, but you are tortured,

849
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,167
you are playing into the hands of such a person.

850
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:50,042
So best thing is to forgive.

851
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,667
Forgiveness is a very important in Sahaja Yoga.

852
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:57,751
So, I would request you to forgive everyone, before starting this.

853
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,459
Is a very simple thing, which one has to do,

854
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,667
is that we'll take out our shoes.

855
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:07,959
Those who are upstairs, can come down, will be better.

856
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:28,000
There are seats in front also, if some people want to come.

857
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:46,667
All right?

858
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,542
Just put some water.

859
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:52,250
Will you show them there? All right, just a minute.

860
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:03,125
Just move down. There are some people who are waiting, to come in.

861
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:33,834
Now, Frank will show you,

862
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,626
how we are going to raise our own Kundalinis.

863
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:41,959
It's very simple method

864
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,125
to understand, very simple.

865
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:48,042
First of all, you put your left hand towards Me,

866
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:53,250
which represents your wish, your desire to get Self-Realization.

867
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:56,501
Just please put it, left hand like that. Be comfortable.

868
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,417
You need not sit with a slouch,

869
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:01,042
you need not put with a very, too much straight.

870
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,209
Just simple.

871
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:08,459
So, left hand, we put like this, and with the right hand

872
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:10,999
we nourish our centers on the left hand side,

873
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,459
nourish our centers on the left hand side.

874
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:17,125
Put both the feet apart from each other.

875
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:21,792
Now, put your right hand on your heart,

876
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,876
because right hand stands for action, or the power of action.

877
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:30,459
On the heart. Here resides the Spirit, as I told you.

878
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:33,125
Then we have to put our right hand

879
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:36,000
in the upper portion of our abdomen.

880
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,709
Just now, you see all this,

881
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:41,459
and later on you will close your eyes and follow it.

882
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:44,959
We have to work only on the left hand side.

883
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,250
In the upper portion of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

884
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:50,834
Then we take down our right hand

885
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,999
in the lower portion of our abdomen.

886
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:06,584
This is the center which manifests

887
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:13,167
the divinity on our central nervous system.

888
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:19,792
That means we become knowledgeable, gnostics, the bodha.

889
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,459
Now, you have to rise your hand in the upper portion

890
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,209
of your abdomen.

891
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:28,209
Now, this is the center,

892
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:31,792
which is the center of mastery.

893
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,292
Great saints, prophets, have created this special center for us,

894
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,792
so we have to enlighten this one also.

895
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:47,417
Then we take our right hand on our heart.

896
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:52,999
As I told you, this is the center of our Spirit.

897
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,250
Then we take our hand

898
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:58,918
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder,

899
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:01,959
and put our right hand on the back side of it

900
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,125
and turn our head to our right.

901
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:09,918
This is the center which is disturbed when we feel guilty.

902
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:16,000
Then we take our right hand

903
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:19,626
onto our forehead across,

904
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:22,417
and push it down as much as we can.

905
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:24,292
Allow the head to rest on it.

906
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:28,250
Now press it on both the sides.

907
01:00:34,876 --> 01:00:38,626
This is the center to forgive others.

908
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:43,459
Take down our hand. Take up on the back side

909
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:49,792
of our head and put our head resting on it, upward.

910
01:00:51,626 --> 01:00:56,125
This is the center to ask for forgiveness from Divine,

911
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:59,000
without feeling guilty.

912
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,042
Then we stretch our hand,

913
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,999
we stretch our palm.

914
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:06,375
The center of our palm

915
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:09,209
we put it

916
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,918
on the fontanel bone area.

917
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:20,375
And bend our head, as much as we can.

918
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:24,626
Now, push back your fingers. Please, push back your fingers,

919
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:29,918
so there is a sufficient pressure on your scalp.

920
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:34,501
And now you have to move your scalp seven times,

921
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,834
very slowly, clockwise.

922
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:04,250
Now, it’s done.

923
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,709
That’s all we have to do.

924
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:12,542
You can take out, take down your spectacles if you want,

925
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,667
because sometimes even eyesight improves.

926
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,626
And now you have to close your eyes.

927
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,792
Untill I tell you please, don’t open them. Please, don’t open them.

928
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:22,667
Remember to keep your feet apart from each other,

929
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,834
and just this left hand like this.

930
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:33,834
Like this, bend you head, push back your fingers,

931
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:39,459
and move your scalp like this, seven times, slowly.

932
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:43,000
This is important. You push back your fingers,

933
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:46,834
then there is a pressure, and you can do it much better. All right?

934
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,417
Now, let’s see.

935
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,334
Please, close your eyes!

936
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:56,792
But you should be pleasantly pleased towards yourself.

937
01:02:56,999 --> 01:02:58,959
You have to forgive yourself and you have to be

938
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,584
very pleasantly placed towards yourselves.

939
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:04,999
Not to be angry with yourself, that is very important.

940
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:07,334
Now, put your left hand towards Me

941
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:11,167
and right hand on your heart.

942
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:18,250
Close your eyes, please!

943
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:24,792
Here, you have to ask Me a question.

944
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:28,876
As you ask a computer, you have to ask a question.

945
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:33,501
You can call me Shri Mataji or you can call me Mother,

946
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:36,209
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

947
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,751
Ask this question in your heart three times.

948
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:41,083
Not loudly, in your heart,  three times,

949
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:44,042
”Mother, am I the Spirit?“

950
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,709
It's a very important question.

951
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:05,584
Now,

952
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:11,209
you take down your hand,

953
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,375
onto the upper portion of your abdomen,

954
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:16,250
on the left hand side and press it hard.

955
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:20,876
If you are the Spirit, you are your master.

956
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:25,751
So now ask another question to Me, three times, in your heart,

957
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:28,999
”Mother,

958
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:31,292
am I my own master?

959
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,501
Mother, am I my own guru?”

960
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:37,167
Ask this question three times.

961
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:02,918
As I've told you, I cannot

962
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:08,584
cross over your freedom, which I respect.

963
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:12,209
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

964
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:13,876
You have to ask for it.

965
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:15,834
So, now, please, put your right hand

966
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,042
in the low portion of your abdomen,

967
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,876
on the left hand side.

968
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:25,501
And ask

969
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,709
“Mother,

970
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:32,751
please, give me pure knowledge!”

971
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:37,375
Say it six times, because this center has got six petals.

972
01:05:37,626 --> 01:05:41,042
So please say, “Mother, please,

973
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:45,167
give Me pure knowledge”.

974
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:53,584
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

975
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:57,459
there's movement in your Kundalini, which you may not feel.

976
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:01,751
It's rising, so we have to

977
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:09,042
nourish the higher centers, with our self-confidence.

978
01:06:10,459 --> 01:06:14,792
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

979
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:17,334
in the left hand side, on the left hand side,

980
01:06:17,626 --> 01:06:22,501
and here you say with full confidence

981
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,626
ten times,

982
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:30,834
“Mother, I am my own master“.

983
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:32,751
It's very good

984
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:37,417
for people who have been specially tortured by other gurus.

985
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:42,125
”Mother, I am my own master”. Please, say it ten times.

986
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:02,125
So now, raise your right hand

987
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:14,792
onto your heart, where resides the Spirit.

988
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:16,999
And the Spirit

989
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:22,876
is the state, to which you have to rise.

990
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:27,167
With full confidence now, raising your hand

991
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:31,167
to your heart, with full confidence,

992
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,999
you have to say,

993
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:37,501
“Mother I am the Spirit.

994
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:43,709
Mother, I am the Spirit”. Say it twelve times, please.

995
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:59,083
The Divine is the ocean

996
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:03,751
of knowledge and love.

997
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:10,584
It is the ocean of bliss and peace,

998
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:15,250
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

999
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:19,834
So you cannot do anything, which cannot be forgiven

1000
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:24,167
by that great power of forgiveness.

1001
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:28,167
So now, you raise your right hand

1002
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,667
in the corner of your neck

1003
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:32,918
and your shoulder,

1004
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,125
push it back as much as you can,

1005
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:38,209
and turn your head to your right.

1006
01:08:39,999 --> 01:08:43,709
Here you have to say sixteen times,

1007
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:46,209
with full confidence,

1008
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,834
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all”.

1009
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,792
Please, say it with full confidence.

1010
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,125
I’ve already told you,

1011
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:10,083
that whether we forgive someone

1012
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:12,626
or don't forgive, we don't do anything.

1013
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:16,792
But if we don’t forgive, then we play into wrong hands.

1014
01:09:16,999 --> 01:09:19,999
So, please, now,

1015
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:23,209
raise your hand to your forehead

1016
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:30,501
and put down your head, slowly.

1017
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:34,626
Let it rest on your hand

1018
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:38,292
and press it hard on both the sides.

1019
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:46,250
This is the center where we have to forgive everyone.

1020
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:49,709
So, please, say it from your heart,

1021
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:53,417
from your heart, not how many times,

1022
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:58,250
“Mother, I forgive everyone”. Is very important!

1023
01:09:58,459 --> 01:10:00,834
Please, say this, from your heart.

1024
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:02,834
Open your heart and say,

1025
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:06,417
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

1026
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,792
Now, take back your right hand

1027
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:19,876
on the back side of your head,

1028
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:23,834
and turn in upward as far as possible.

1029
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,125
Let it rest on your hand.

1030
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:31,417
Here, without feeling guilty,

1031
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,250
without counting your mistakes,

1032
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:37,375
without blaming yourselves for anything,

1033
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:39,834
just for your satisfaction,

1034
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:42,876
you have to say in your heart,

1035
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:46,584
opening your heart, not how many times,

1036
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,417
“Oh Divine,

1037
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,375
if I have done any mistake, please forgive me”.

1038
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,792
In humility you have to say,

1039
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:59,000
“Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please, forgive me.”

1040
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:15,667
Now, stretch your palm, right hand palm,

1041
01:11:15,876 --> 01:11:20,250
please, and put the center of your palm

1042
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:24,709
on your fontanel bone area,

1043
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:27,876
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

1044
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:31,999
Now, put down your head, as far as possible.

1045
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,584
Now press it hard, push back your fingers nicely,

1046
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,125
press it hard

1047
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:42,417
and you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

1048
01:11:42,626 --> 01:11:49,125
But again, here, I cannot cross over your freedom,

1049
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:50,876
which I respect.

1050
01:11:51,042 --> 01:11:53,792
So, you will have to say,

1051
01:11:53,999 --> 01:11:57,292
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization”.

1052
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:01,042
I cannot force on you. Please, say it seven times,

1053
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,584
“Mother, please, give me my Self-Realization!”

1054
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,209
Push back your fingers please, push back your fingers. Move it.

1055
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:15,334
Put down your heads. Put down your heads.

1056
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:44,375
Now, please, take
down your hands.

1057
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:46,626
Open your eyes, slowly.

1058
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:50,834
Put the hands towards Me, like this.

1059
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:54,751
Now, put down,

1060
01:12:54,959 --> 01:12:57,834
push your hand, right hand like this towards Me,

1061
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,792
and put down your head,

1062
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:02,000
and see for yourself with the left hand,

1063
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:04,959
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

1064
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:06,918
May be little hot, doesn’t matter.

1065
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,542
But it will be some sort of a heat or a cool

1066
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:13,125
coming out of your head.

1067
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:16,584
You have to certify yourself.

1068
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,209
Don’t worry about the air conditioning.

1069
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:20,959
It's coming out of your head.

1070
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,667
Now, put the left hand towards Me

1071
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:26,000
and put your right and again

1072
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:27,584
and see for yourself,

1073
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:31,876
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

1074
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,501
Now change over again, once more.

1075
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:44,959
Put the right hand towards Me and put down your head,

1076
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:48,834
and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze,

1077
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:53,083
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

1078
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:56,209
You have to put it above, not on it.

1079
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:59,584
Above, some people can have it

1080
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:03,042
little far away, some will have it closer.

1081
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:07,167
But you don’t have to touch your head.

1082
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,667
Now,

1083
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,709
push back both your hands.

1084
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:18,250
Raise them, raise them like this.

1085
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:21,792
Push back your head,

1086
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,834
and ask the question,

1087
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:29,083
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1088
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:33,876
"Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of God’s love?"

1089
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,000
"Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

1090
01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:40,083
Ask this question, one of them, three times.

1091
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:45,292
Keep your eyes upward and ask this question.

1092
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:55,751
Now, take down your hands.

1093
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:59,292
Just keep them.

1094
01:14:59,584 --> 01:15:03,083
Try to watch Me without thinking. You can do it.

1095
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,667
You feel very relaxed.

1096
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,918
You can put on your glasses, if you like.

1097
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:17,125
Just put your hands towards Me like this.

1098
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:24,375
Those who have felt the cool breeze out of their head

1099
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:28,626
or on their fingertips, whether hot or cold,

1100
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,751
please, raise both your hands.

1101
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,584
Practically, all of you have felt it.

1102
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:43,999
May God bless you! Just imagine!

1103
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,792
I bow to all the saints.

1104
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:54,876
Now, you have to just know how to establish it

1105
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:58,334
and to work it out. It's very simple.

1106
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:00,834
You have a very good center here,

1107
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:04,501
where people will tell you all about it.

1108
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:06,626
There is nothing to be paid for,

1109
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,250
just you have to give little time to yourself

1110
01:16:09,459 --> 01:16:13,250
and you must respect your Self-Realization.

1111
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:17,209
Gradually, you will grow into it. And I hope next year,

1112
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:20,959
I will see you here as big trees grown.

1113
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,999
Very happy to meet you all.

1114
01:16:23,209 --> 01:16:25,459
All those who have not felt it

1115
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:28,999
can come on one side and the Sahaja Yogis can see them;

1116
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:34,250
And those who have felt it, I would like to meet them, one by one.

1117
01:16:35,584 --> 01:16:38,292
I’d like to shake hands.

1118
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:51,292
[Hindi/Marathi]

1119
01:16:51,876 --> 01:16:53,792
SM: So now...
P:  [unclear] Mother, is lovely.

1120
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:56,999
SM: Lovely. Now, you are lovely, you are fantastic,

1121
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:59,792
and now you have to establish it. You must establish,

1122
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:02,792
give some time. All right? Don't neglect it,

1123
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:04,667
because, unless and until you establish it,

1124
01:17:04,876 --> 01:17:06,417
you cannot become the master of it.

1125
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:09,751
And it takes at the most one month, just to establish it.

1126
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,959
All right? So you meet these people.

1127
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,834
Where is the center, you just announce.

1128
01:17:13,999 --> 01:17:16,626
Lovely. Thank you, you help us.

1129
01:17:20,209 --> 01:17:23,834
So, you got it?

1130
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,751
So you really got, really got it.

1131
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:31,999
Oh, he's very cool and nice.

1132
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:42,709
May God bless you! It’s your own, it’s your own.

1133
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:49,834
Now, you must enjoy yourself more,

1134
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,709
by becoming that fully, all right? You have to become fully.

1135
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,584
You don’t have to do much about it,

1136
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,125
just to know something, that’s all.

1137
01:17:56,334 --> 01:17:58,417
P: Yes. Thank you very much!

1138
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:07,209
It’s all your own, you are what you are!

This is the glory you are! Just enjoy yourself.

01:18:10,459 --> 01:18:13,459
All right? So, very good.

1141
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,959
May God bless you!

1142
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:23,999
Thank you, for what? It's your own.

1143
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:27,834
You enjoy yourself. Just laugh it out. You found it.

1144
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:30,709
That's all, you found it. Eureka!

1145
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:35,375
P: You told me what I wanted to hear.

1146
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:38,125
SM: Really? Good, I am very happy!

1147
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,876
Very good, excellent. May God bless you!

Wonderful. May God bless you!

Enjoy yourself.

01:19:00,584 --> 01:19:01,959
P: Thank you very much!
SM: May God bless you.

1152
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,417
Thank you, for what? You are, it's your own.

1153
01:19:04,626 --> 01:19:07,751
[Actually] I must I thank you for getting your own.

1154
01:19:07,999 --> 01:19:10,876
May God bless you! May God bless you!

1155
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,417
P: Thank You for Your [unclear].

1156
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,250
SM: Come along!

1157
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:18,999
P: Thank You, Mother!
SM: May God bless you!

1158
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:22,751
They are such a beautiful people! May God bless you!

1159
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:25,876
So this is finished now?

1160
01:19:26,042 --> 01:19:27,834
If You are bored You can just throw it away.

1161
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,876
All right. It's all right. I know I told you it's not true.

1162
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,751
May God bless you!

1163
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:46,167
P: Thank You for Your time and goodness.

1164
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:48,751
May God bless you. Now you must give some time to yourself.

1165
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:50,375
That's important, isn't it?

1166
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:53,584
Yes, you should, you should look after yourself.

1167
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:57,792
No more troubles, no more diseases, no more doctors.

1168
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:03,751
May God bless you!

1169
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,834
SM: Yes, just come!
P: I'll have to.

1170
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:09,000
Yes, yes. They have. We have a tour in India,

1171
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:12,417
we too have a tour. So, if you want to come,

1172
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:15,000
you can find out from these people.

1173
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:26,876
Oh, God! Good.

1174
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:29,876
May God bless you!

1175
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:35,959
Enjoy yourself, enjoy. Enjoy.

1176
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,834
But you must come and see them and find out. All right?

1177
01:20:40,999 --> 01:20:42,999
And become experts.

1178
01:20:48,999 --> 01:20:50,999
May God bless you!

1179
01:20:59,918 --> 01:21:02,334
When I put my hand up the first time, I felt it.

1180
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:05,751
and when I took it away it had gone. Is that fine?

1181
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:09,083
You know, when I put it up, I felt it, right?

1182
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:11,042
and it [unclear].

1183
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,792
And then when I put it back it was gone. What had happen?

1184
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,209
It doesn't stay if you are thinking about it! Just don't think.

1185
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:18,834
You should not think about it and argue about it

1186
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,626
or discuss about it. Then you come to your mental level.

1187
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:23,876
It is higher level than that, that’s why you lost it.

1188
01:21:24,042 --> 01:21:26,125
Now, don’t think about it, you can’t think about it.

1189
01:21:26,334 --> 01:21:28,876
You see, you did it without thinking.

1190
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,876
So keep to that state.

1191
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,834
Thank You.

1192
01:21:32,999 --> 01:21:35,834
P: Namaste Mother. Forgive me.

1193
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:42,250
[Hindi]

1194
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:44,292
[Hindi]

1195
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:48,292
[Hindi]

1196
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:52,626
[Hindi]

1197
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,667
Namaste!
Namaste!

1198
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,918
It's good to see You again!

1199
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,292
P: I sort tried to forgive the [unclear].

1200
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:03,999
Sort tried to forgive the [unclear] as You told me last time.

1201
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:05,999
SM: Forgive?
P:The [unclear].

1202
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:09,959
The white man, he and his [unclear]. For marrying, You were saying.

1203
01:22:11,751 --> 01:22:13,584
P: Thank you I hope we are a forest

1204
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,167
of tall trees next time You visit.

1205
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:18,918
SM: Yes, we have to see. Is already described that.

1206
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:22,125
And there's a poem that: “Come along the forest

1207
01:22:22,334 --> 01:22:24,584
of [great] trees of giving blessing. Like that.

1208
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:27,459
There's a Marathi poem like that describing you all,

1209
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:30,334
as the oceans of love,

1210
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:32,125
which speak.

1211
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:35,375
Beautiful descriptions, there is about you, people.

1212
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:41,667
P: I was wondering, we used [unclear] woman,

1213
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:43,876
not to shake hands but just
kiss them on the cheek.

1214
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,999
SM: All right. It is all right. You are My son.

1215
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:52,334
SM: You are My child.
P: We actually try and tell other people.

1216
01:22:52,584 --> 01:22:54,876
SM: Please do, please do and bring them along.

1217
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,167
We have a center here, luckily, very good center,

1218
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,375
which we work it on.

1219
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:01,501
I had a friend, he was very closed to a

1220
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:03,042
one of the seekers who...

1221
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,584
Yes. There are so many. There are so many lost.

1222
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:07,876
[unclear] incarnation but that is part of...

1223
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:10,459
Yes, that is there. It's a part of it.

1224
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:12,709
They'll tell you all about it. All right?

1225
01:23:12,959 --> 01:23:15,667
SM: So, now, are you all right?
P: Yes, thank you.

1226
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:21,000
Please [unclear] from forty years old and I believe

1227
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,626
by next time when I see you [unclear] my life

01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,167
I'm forty years old and I believe next year when I see You

01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,999
[unclear]

1230

Of course, they can, of course. May God bless you!

1231
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:41,792
May God bless you!

1232
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:45,999
Enjoy now, enjoy!

01:23:52,999 --> 01:23:55,501
Enjoy. Enjoy.

P:Thank you very much!
SM: May God bless you!

1237
01:24:13,876 --> 01:24:15,792
SM: You come from Fiji?
P: South Africa.

1238
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:20,334
South Africa, really? We have somebody from South Africa here.

1239
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:27,375
We are having a nice center there in South Africa, so many.

1240
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:30,999
At least they were saying about one thousand people in South Africa

1241
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:33,751
doing Sahaja Yoga. It's very good.

1242
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,459
Enjoy yourself now.

1243
01:24:41,417 --> 01:24:42,918
You are also from South Africa?

1244
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,125
P: No, I am from New Zealand, my mother...

1245
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:48,083
I'm from, born in New Zealand and my mother is from Gujarat,

1246
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,209
so she stays in India.

1247
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:53,999
P: Gujarat and stays in India.
SM: Oh I see, Gujarat.

1248
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:56,417
Oh, Gujarat also we are doing very well.

1249
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:58,999
P: Yes, but I am in New Zealand.

1250
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:06,999
P: I've asked to be guided for many years for the right teacher.

1251
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:09,667
I've asked for many years to be guided

1252
01:25:09,876 --> 01:25:12,626
to the right teacher and I feel I've got it now.

1253
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:15,918
SM: Now, there are people who will make you a teacher yourself.

1254
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,792
And you should get it more people. You are from India?

1255
01:25:18,999 --> 01:25:21,834
P: Yes, well I am born here.
SM: Yes, you are born here, doesn't matter.

1256
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:23,709
There are so many Indians here.

1257
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:25,834
And please tell them that the time has come for them

1258
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:27,918
to get what is promised. All right?

1259
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:30,918
Yes. [unclear]

1260
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,334
SM: You are from where?
P: I'm from South Africa.

1261
01:25:35,918 --> 01:25:38,375
Really? We have somebody here from South Africa.

1262
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:41,042
Yes, that was my wife [unclear].
SM: Maharaj is there.

1263
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:42,626
May God bless you.

1264
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:45,083
And we are doing very well in South Africa, surprisingly.

1265
01:25:45,292 --> 01:25:48,000
There are thousand people who are Sahaja Yogis now in South Africa.

1266
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,834
P: Which part of South Africa? SM:I don’t know exactly.

1267
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,417
I won't be able to tell you but if you want

1268
01:25:52,626 --> 01:25:53,999
I'll give you the address of those people.

1269
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:56,626
P: Yes, but I’m living here now, permanently, in New Zealand.

1270
01:25:56,834 --> 01:26:00,167
P: Thank you very much. I leave you.
SM: So may God bless you!

1271
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,250
P: It's beautiful!
SM: Enjoy.

1272
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:05,292
You are all beautiful. You just know your own beauty now.

1273
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:08,584
It’s time for you to know your beauty and glory.

1274
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:11,999
So, now, how are you?

1275
01:26:16,834 --> 01:26:20,000
Now, you are all seekers, you see? It’s your right to get it.

1276
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:22,999
All right? It’s your right to get it.

1277
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,999
Here's another one, a great seeker here.

1278
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,751
May God bless you!

1279
01:26:28,959 --> 01:26:30,667
P: I've always been interested in Kundalini.

1280
01:26:30,876 --> 01:26:34,501
SM: Now, you have it. It's under your control. You can raise it,

1281
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:37,918
to anybody if you want to. Got it.

1282
01:26:41,999 --> 01:26:45,334
P:What I want to know, is why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

1283
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:48,999
Why didn't I want to seek a long time ago?

1284
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:52,667
Why now? I can't understand that.

1285
01:26:52,918 --> 01:26:56,501
SM: I'm sorry for that. I know but

1286
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:59,334
it is the time, has to come.

1287
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:01,125
It has to ripe.

1288
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:04,709
I was here many times before,

1289
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:08,375
three times before I've been here, in New Zealand.

1290
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:11,250
SM: I’ll come back again next year.
P: We need you.

1291
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:15,709
Now, you meet them, and become the full, right?

1292
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:22,626
What a question! But that's true. Some people take time.

1293
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:27,501
Isn't it? Because I've been here before also, for your information.

1294
01:27:31,876 --> 01:27:35,042
P: I got a question. I felt the heat in my left hand

1295
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,292
SM: You come from what place?

1296
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,751
SM: You come from which place?
P: From Singapore.

1297
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:42,999
SM: From Singapore with the left hand side?

1298
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:45,834
P: With my left hand, you know I did not feel anything.

1299
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,834
SM: Left hand couldn't feel anything.
P: Right hand couldn't feel anything.

1300
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:51,999
SM: All right, so you forgive. Singapore is a very speedy people.

1301
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:57,292
And now, you forgive anything? See now?

1302
01:27:58,959 --> 01:28:01,292
All right? You have to forgive.

1303
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:04,250
Thank you. It was beautiful.

1304
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:07,834
So beautiful you are. Enjoy your own beauty.

1305
01:28:08,459 --> 01:28:10,334
You are all so beautiful people.

1306
01:28:10,584 --> 01:28:14,375
Aren't you ike flowers? Very nice to meet you.

1307
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:17,417
Very nice to meet you.

1308
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:25,709
[Hindi]

1309
01:28:25,918 --> 01:28:28,209
[Hindi]

1310
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:31,959
[Hindi]

1311
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,209
Just Imagine!

1312
01:28:33,459 --> 01:28:36,167
That gentleman, just call him; that why he's feeling hot.

1313
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:39,334
Hello. Call your son. I'll tell him.

1314
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:42,334
[Hindi]

1315
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:43,459
He has gone and this is my son.

1316
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,999
All right. So that's the thing. That's wrong.

1317
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:49,000
That’s why you and he, both are feeling hot.

1318
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,417
All right? He is not a right person.

1319
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:53,999
You want diamonds or you want God?

1320
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:55,250
P: God.

1321
01:28:55,459 --> 01:28:58,667
It's all right. Then, give him up.

1322
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,459
SM: You are from where?
P: Fiji.

1323
01:29:03,709 --> 01:29:06,167
SM: Fiji? There are lots of Fiji people here.

1324
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:09,042
[Hindi]

1325
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:12,083
[Hindi]

1326
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:16,083
[Hindi]

1327
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:19,876
[Hindi]

1328
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:23,083
[Hindi]

1329
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:27,167
[hindi]

1330
01:29:28,584 --> 01:29:32,083
[Hindi]

1331
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:33,667
[Hindi]

1332
01:29:33,876 --> 01:29:35,999
Do You think I should go there and [unclear].

1333
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,918
SM: Where ? P: Over there.

1334
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:40,709
SM: Of course, of course.

1335
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:46,250
[Jane Lee] In the process I felt something here and afterwards.

1336
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:49,999
SM: Liver. You didn't forgive my child. You have to forgive.

1337
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:53,959
That's something I've been requested you all. Just forgive.

1338
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,709
That's why you felt it there. Now is better?

1339
01:30:00,042 --> 01:30:01,626
All right? Got it.

1340
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:05,834
So there's only little thing you didn't do, is to forgive.

1341
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,999
Thank You.

1342
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:12,876

again, You want again to go? [unclear]

1344
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:20,876
I wish I could go sometimes to all these places. May God bless you.

1345
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,918
So now...

1346
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:29,125
You got it very well? Isn't it ? Feel it?

1347
01:30:29,417 --> 01:30:32,918
Yes, yes. I can see on your face. The eyes are dilatated.

1348
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:35,125
There's a sparkle in the eyes when you get your Realization.

1349
01:30:35,334 --> 01:30:38,167
P: Before I came in, I had warm from my hands anyway.

1350
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:40,167
SM: And now is good.

1351
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,834
Yes, that's correct.

1352
01:30:42,999 --> 01:30:45,375
I'm still trying to feel it correctly.

1353
01:30:45,584 --> 01:30:48,000
Yes, you should. You should try to meet these people

1354
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,626
and just establish yourself.

1355
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:53,626
P: My mother is member of your group, and so is Katrina.

1356
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:55,667
SM: Really?
P: She’s my daughter.

1357
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:58,751
Oh, good, very nice.

1358
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:01,959
SM: Hello sir. P: Nice to meet you.

1359
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,417
May God bless you.

1360
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,125
Nice to meet you!

1361
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:08,125
P: When do You come to New Zealand again?

1362
01:31:08,334 --> 01:31:10,334
SM: Next year?
P: Next year.

1363
01:31:15,999 --> 01:31:18,542
[Hindi]

1364
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:21,667
[Hindi]

1365
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,167
[Hindi]

1366
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,125
P: Thank you very much.
SM: May God bless you!

1367
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:31,959
So, now, it is all right.
P: It was very nice to receive

1368
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:35,167
Your powerful talks. Thank You!

1369
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:38,417
SM: It is power of Love, my child, it is just power of Love.

1370
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,501
Nothing more than that. All right?

1371
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
May God bless you!

1372
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:46,417
Thank You very much. It was lovely. And now is available.

1373
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,709
I don't know what I felt [unclear].

1374
01:31:48,918 --> 01:31:51,667
Now, you must forgive, that is the point, you see.

1375
01:31:51,876 --> 01:31:53,542
If you don’t forgive, you won’t feel it.

1376
01:31:53,751 --> 01:31:55,626
You have to forgive from your heart.

1377
01:31:55,834 --> 01:31:59,083
Just now, you see? Better?

1378
01:31:59,459 --> 01:32:01,918
P: Yes, yes.
SM: You have to forgive.

1379
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,417
P: Yes, thank You.

1380
01:32:03,626 --> 01:32:06,042
SM: That's the only thing you have to do is to forgive.

1381
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,834
It's a bit too much now. How are you?

1382
01:32:07,999 --> 01:32:09,584
Thank You for an interesting talk.

1383
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:11,751
Now, you must come and see them, all right?

1384
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:15,626
And achieve it and get boys of your age group. Very important!

1385
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,167
You know there's an attack, a negative attack .

1386
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:19,918
coming to your country. You must know that.

1387
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:22,334
Drugs, this, that, all kinds of things.

1388
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:25,667
P: Thank You very much. It was lovely. Thank You.

1389
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:34,459
P: You'll help me to help myself?

1390
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:36,792
SM: Yes, you will. You just go and see them.

1391
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:40,918
SM: You will help yourself and you help others also.

1392
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,709
[unclear]

1393
01:32:46,918 --> 01:32:49,459
Hot. You must forgive, just forgive.

1394
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:53,792
Forgive. Is important to forgive.

1395
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:57,334
Just forgive!

1396
01:32:57,792 --> 01:32:59,792
Better?

1397
01:33:03,999 --> 01:33:06,834
SM: You are from where?
P: I'm from New Zealand.

1398
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,876
SM: From where.
P: New Zealand. I'm from India.

1399
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,709
SM: From where? P: From Bombay.

1400
01:33:11,918 --> 01:33:13,167
SM: From Bombay?

1401
01:33:13,375 --> 01:33:15,000
P: But I've been here long time.

1402
01:33:15,209 --> 01:33:17,876
I have come when I was ten and I've been here 40 years now.

1403
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:21,667
SM: Really?
P: Yes, but I have problems with my own children.

1404
01:33:21,876 --> 01:33:24,626
SM: They will be all right. Now you first of all learn all these things.

1405
01:33:24,834 --> 01:33:26,667
Yes. Then you can solve all the problems.

1406
01:33:26,876 --> 01:33:29,751
First you learn it, you become a master and then you can manage.

1407
01:33:29,959 --> 01:33:31,584
All right? May God Bless you.

1408
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:34,167
P: That's my daughter.
SM: How are you?

1409
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:37,709
All right! You're all right. Forgive!

1410
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:40,501
Just you forgive!

1411
01:33:41,334 --> 01:33:43,626
What is there at such a young age you don’t forgive?

1412
01:33:43,834 --> 01:33:46,918
You must forgive now. Even the old people have forgiven.

1413
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:48,709
Right?

1414
01:33:48,918 --> 01:33:50,709
Now better.

1415
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,167
All right?

1416
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,626
P: Thank you.
SM: Go and see them.

1417
01:33:56,834 --> 01:33:59,959
P: Thank you! We saw You in two classes in London

1418
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:01,999
and to see You here is a wonderful thing.

1419
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,000
SM: Really? When was that?

1420
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:07,626
P: I don't know, we just attended two of your two classes in London.

1421
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:09,334
SM: Oh, I see, the courses.

1422
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:11,250
P: And the course is in Wimbledon.

1423
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:13,375
SM: This, just see,

1424
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:16,042
he has attended the courses in Wimbledon, he says.

1425
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,501
Yes, good.

1426
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:20,709
P: So thank you for this marvelous gift and also Your coming.

1427
01:34:20,918 --> 01:34:23,999
SM: Very good. Now you go and meet them. You are here or in London?

1428
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:26,918
P: We are living here.
SM: All right, that's very good.

1429
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,999
P: I've been enjoying listening to You.

1430
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:31,542
I was very interested as I have breast cancer.

1431
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:32,959
P: That's why I was interested to hear

1432
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,584
what You said about breast cancer.

1433
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:36,834
SM: Was that the reason?
P: Yes.

1434
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,626
P: What was that?
SM: Is that the reason, you are insecure?

1435
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,334
P: Yes, yes, there's nothing. I always think that You say it. Yes.

1436
01:34:44,918 --> 01:34:48,709
SM: You have seen that?
P: No, no that's leaving me now.

1437
01:34:48,918 --> 01:34:50,334
SM: Now it's all right. You'll be all right.

1438
01:34:50,501 --> 01:34:51,959
Is that the reason?
P: Yes it is.

1439
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,459
It is the reason. That’s why in the West,

1440
01:34:54,667 --> 01:34:57,918
see women are very insecure. And men must understand this,

1441
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:01,834
the way they go on with this woman, that woman.

1442
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,999
P: I don't, I believe that I can’t expect him to understand,

1443
01:35:06,209 --> 01:35:08,834
but I understand it myself now and that's important.

1444
01:35:08,999 --> 01:35:12,584
SM: It is better to be yourself. See that the whole joy is with you.

1445
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:15,999
P: Yes, I'll try. I understand that. Thank you.

1446
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:21,999
SM: So, now, how are you?
P: Very good. Thank You, Mother.

1447
01:35:22,709 --> 01:35:24,999
You, great!

1448
01:35:27,751 --> 01:35:29,459
Now you must develop it within yourself.

1449
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,375
So develop it. You become a master of it.

1450
01:35:31,626 --> 01:35:33,542
It is very easy, it's very simple.

1451
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:36,501
Because is so innate within you so you just become that.

1452
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:39,959
But you must know how to manage it, how to give Realization,

1453
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:42,792
so you can help so many people.

1454
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:50,125
So how are you? Oh you, very good. Wonderful.

1455
01:35:50,334 --> 01:35:53,501
P: What is there?
SM: You will see, the cool.

1456
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,709
SM: So, how are you?
P: I don't [put in] to understand.

1457
01:35:59,918 --> 01:36:02,999
All right, now, that's a [unclear]. Did you forgive?

1458
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,334
SM: Did you forgive everyone?
P: Yes.

1459
01:36:06,584 --> 01:36:09,000
Really? No, you did not. Now forgive.

1460
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:12,459
Now forgive, before Me you better forgive. Forgive, forgive.

1461
01:36:15,584 --> 01:36:17,959
Now,

1462
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:20,584
is there a cool breeze now?

1463
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:22,584
Now, you didn't forgive. Just forgive.

1464
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:25,626
Just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".  Just say that.

1465
01:36:25,834 --> 01:36:28,999
Say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

1466
01:36:34,876 --> 01:36:37,083
All right?

1467
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:39,584
It's releasing now?

1468
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,667
Such a headache is over if you forgive.

1469
01:36:41,876 --> 01:36:45,626
Why to carry this headache of not forgiving?

1470
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:47,459
Now, see?

1471
01:36:47,709 --> 01:36:49,918
May God bless you!

1472
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:53,999
SM: So, how are you?
P: Good, good.

1473
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:58,709
SM: Please, forgive.
P: I got it stronger in one hand than in the other.

1474
01:36:58,918 --> 01:37:02,501
SM: In this hand you had strong? Yes. What work you do?

1475
01:37:02,999 --> 01:37:05,667
Brick liner. Brick liner.

1476
01:37:05,876 --> 01:37:07,667
P: Brick liner.
SM: I didn't understand.

1477
01:37:07,876 --> 01:37:10,292
P: Brick liner.
SM: Brick layer, brick layer.

1478
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:14,250
That’s a physical work. That’s why.

1479
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,209
Now, it's better now?

1480
01:37:23,501 --> 01:37:26,000
May God bless you! Little, one goes into imbalance,

1481
01:37:26,209 --> 01:37:28,042
because you are doing a physical work.

1482
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:31,209
The left is less. So they will teach you how to get into balance.

1483
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:34,501
That's all. All right? May God bless you!
