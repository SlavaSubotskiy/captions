1
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:09,989
Today's Puja of Vishnumaya,

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,738
who was the sister of Shri Krishna,

3
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:19,614
was not scheduled as such in an international

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,489
pujas that we do.

5
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,614
But they say for the love of God

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,156
when all the devotees assemble,

7
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:37,489
God also has to break many rules,

8
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:44,364
and that's how this puja has been accepted to be done.

9
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:48,738
At least once it should be done, I think, was a good idea.

10
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:50,905
By your love

11
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:58,030
and your devotion it was desired,

12
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:02,780
and so this puja is going to be performed.

13
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,738
It's just spontaneous

14
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:10,864
that I happened to be in England at this time,

15
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,738
because this puja if ever had happened,

16
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,614
would have happened in India.

17
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:21,905
Because this is a puja of a deity,

18
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:25,030
Vishnumaya,

19
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:31,780
the seed of which is not easy to plant

20
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,738
in the Western countries.

21
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:42,573
Now the whole shakti programming has been done

22
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,573
in such a way that we have Mother as a Shakti first,

23
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,780
the Primordial Mother.

24
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:54,197
Then we have three shaktis coming out of Her,

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,905
as you know - Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

26
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:02,197
And then we have children from them:

27
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:05,989
brothers and sisters.

28
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:10,573
So before the power

29
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,239
of what we call the wife or the spouse was created,

30
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,905
is the power of the sister is created.

31
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,989
So, as you know that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha were born

32
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,698
to these three Shaktis,

33
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:25,030
and they all had sisters.

34
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:28,364
And their sisters were married

35
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:35,197
- like Vishnu's sister is Parvati

36
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,364
and She was married to Shiva.

37
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,364
Is very important to understand

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,197
that these three types of powers

39
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:49,698
always play on the chakras.

40
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:52,239
And if you understand these three powers,

41
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,656
how they play,

42
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,364
then you will understand

43
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:59,239
what is the importance of Vishnumaya is.

44
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:04,656
Vishnumaya is the power of a sister in a family.

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,489
So the female is the power,

46
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,114
and the male is the kinetic power

47
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,573
which asserts the powers

48
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,448
of these three powers which surround him.

49
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,698
So when the male power comes in,

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,489
all these powers become

51
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:39,322
helpful acting associates with that power.

52
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:44,239
Now Vishnumaya's power is very important to understand,

53
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,573
because Mother power is to protect your innocence,

54
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:49,822
because that is the most important thing.

55
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,114
To protect your innocence is the Mother's power.

56
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:58,822
Now, Vishnumaya's power is to protect your chastity.

57
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:04,406
You don't understand sometimes what is chastity

58
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:06,947
and what is innocence.

59
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:11,698
Innocence is a power which is not acted upon.

60
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,406
Like we have electricity in our house,

61
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:19,322
the electricity exists like innocence exists within us;

62
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,822
but enactment of that is done through chastity.

63
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:27,822
A person can say,

64
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:31,239
"I did this very innocently" - no, he cannot.

65
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:34,197
Because whatever you do if it is innocent,

66
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:37,114
cannot be harmful to your character,

67
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:41,698
to your innocence or to your righteousness.

68
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,780
So those people who say like this,

69
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,448
that "I did it innocently" are wrong,

70
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:50,739
because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity.

71
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:55,573
So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity.

72
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:59,905
You must have respect of your chastity.

73
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:04,322
Chastity is the one which is Vishnumaya's power within us,

74
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:07,156
Gauri's power, is the pure virgin.

75
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,864
She doesn't marry.

76
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,739
As you know that Vishnumaya was created,

77
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,905
just after Her birth She was killed by Kamsa.

78
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:23,364
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us,

79
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,864
we have to know that chastity is the foundation

80
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:28,739
of all dharmas.

81
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,489
Unless and until you have sense of chastity

82
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,364
you cannot have dharma.

83
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:36,905
Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation.

84
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,489
It will be a house of cards;

85
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,448
if you do not have the foundation of chastity

86
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,698
it will just collapse in no time.

87
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,239
So is a very important thing is chastity

88
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,864
which has been challenged in the West throughout,

89
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,114
and that's why I'm saying is difficult

90
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:57,489
to sow the seed of chastity in this country.

91
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:58,989
And that it should happen,

92
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,322
there must be some divine plan I think,

93
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:05,780
that it has happened that this great puja

94
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,989
should be performed here.

95
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,864
It's not a easy puja to do

96
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,114
- is to be done by people who are innocent,

97
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:14,573
done by people who have lead a very religious life;

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,364
those who have been very chaste,

99
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,322
have respected their chastity.

100
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:19,780
But now as you are saints,

101
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,072
before you everything is pure and good,

102
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:27,322
because now you have been leading a saintly life.

103
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:31,364
That's why chastity has become awakened in you,

104
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:35,114
and chastity works in you as Gauri, as your kundalini.

105
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:40,656
So if you come to the essence of religious life,

106
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:44,989
of righteous life, of Sahaja Yoga life, is chastity.

107
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,989
You cannot diversify it.

108
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:53,322
Now this chastity gives you the maryadas,

109
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:54,905
means delimits you.

110
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,114
(Why are you sitting here?

111
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,114
Go further, it's better to be in front.

112
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,989
This is - you are not doing the puja.

113
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,114
If you are doing the puja, then you sit here.

114
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,905
Otherwise, better sit down.

115
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,739
Better get My vibrations there,

116
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,239
in front. Here, come along.)

117
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:22,738
So the chastity is the one that gives you maryadas,

118
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,614
gives you the limits.

119
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,656
How does it give you the limits?

120
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,156
Like the, in the sky is the lightning.

121
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,364
When the two clouds,

122
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,864
who are like Sahaja yogis we can say,

123
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:42,322
came out of the sea

124
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,072
and pure water is

125
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,780
there in the, those clouds,

126
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:57,738
and they have to be poured out;

127
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:03,156
when they come closer together

128
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:06,448
and cross their limits of their ego,

129
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,614
or fight with each other or in any way clash,

130
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,489
is, there is this chastity,

131
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,030
this lightning that takes place.

132
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:21,197
This lightning which says that

133
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:24,489
"You are wrong. Why are you fighting among yourself?

134
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,989
Why are you crossing each other's ego?"

135
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,780
That's the sister's job.

136
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,322
Yesterday we have had many sisters.

137
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,239
Now the sister's job is not to take sides,

138
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,489
but to show that if you cross your limits

139
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:38,989
of your brotherliness,

140
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:42,156
then there will be a lightning.

141
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,905
Now this power of lightning

142
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,989
is a part of the power of Shri Krishna

143
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,573
which He took it out from Himself.

144
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,489
That's why He became such a sweet,

145
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,989
gentle incarnation.

146
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,239
He took it out.

147
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,030
He said, "Now you've become My sister,

148
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,698
and every time they try to misbehave you better work it out.

149
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:13,864
And that's how Shri Krishna became such a gentle and a very,

150
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,448
as they call it, romantic incarnation;

151
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:21,030
because He took out the sisterly part away

152
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,780
and He worked it out.

153
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,531
But She was always with Him

154
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,738
and She worked with Him;

155
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,822
because the sister in the family

156
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:31,531
has to see that the brothers don't fight,

157
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,614
they are all looked after well,

158
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,406
that they are not challenged by others,

159
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,698
that she gives them the maryadas

160
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:42,780
how far to go - how far to go.

161
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
Now it's very important,

162
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,406
very, very important for all of us to understand

163
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,406
that Freud and all these nonsensical people

164
00:09:53,698 --> 00:10:00,406
brought forth the theories to challenge Vishnumaya,

165
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:08,947
so that we should have all kinds of funny relationships,

166
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:11,281
which is an impossibility,

167
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:12,905
is a wrong thing.

168
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:16,489
Now if there is any relationship like that

169
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:21,156
between brothers and sisters,

170
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:25,822
for seven generations the family suffers

171
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:29,239
from terrible diseases - seven generations.

172
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:36,531
But if there's another like Freud-style relationship,

173
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:40,905
then fourteen generations the family has to suffer.

174
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:46,489
So the limiting forces of Vishnumaya are such

175
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:50,448
that your ego is controlled, your superego is controlled,

176
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,114
your family is controlled.

177
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,489
Everybody is under control,

178
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,364
under the guidance of this pure power of Vishnumaya

179
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,489
which exists within all of us.

180
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,989
And the saddest part is that

181
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,698
in all the Western countries

182
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:12,364
Vishnumaya is sick, absolutely sick.

183
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,905
I mean, I have lost My hearing even,

184
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:17,281
up to that point it has come,

185
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,905
on the left-hand side,

186
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:24,364
because the sense of chastity is completely lacking.

187
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:27,698
We have to forget about the people now

188
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,822
who have no sense at all, but now we are Sahaja yogis.

189
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,114
So coming to the right point, we have to say that,

190
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:39,489
that many people have still some lingering funny ideas,

191
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,822
like "I have a good friendship with that gentleman"

192
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,780
or "I'm very friendly with such and such gentleman"

193
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,030
and all that.

194
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,947
It's not a maryada then.

195
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:55,281
You cannot have friendship with - between men and women,

196
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,989
you cannot, it's absolutely absurd.

197
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,239
In the West the whole culture is funny;

198
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,114
because if you go to a dinner party

199
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:04,989
you are supposed to sit with somebody's husband

200
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,364
on both the sides - horrible!

201
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:11,030
But in the East it's not done,

202
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,364
because the Vishnumaya is against these things.

203
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:19,156
She will see to it that husband and wife sit together.

204
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:24,364
Now here, as you know, the chastity part

205
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:25,905
is so much missing

206
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:28,030
that our left Vishuddhis are catching.

207
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,114
And when I talk about it, it catches more.

208
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,905
Now when you say you are not guilty,

209
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:36,905
you are actually admitting it to Vishnumaya,

210
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,156
to your own sister,

211
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:41,698
saying that "I am not guilty."

212
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:44,905
But She doesn't like you to have the guilt upon you.

213
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,364
The wife may like you to have the guilt.

214
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:49,406
She may like that you should have the guilt,

215
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,030
because she thinks her power is challenged

216
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:55,989
and that she has somebody who is her rival.

217
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,905
But not, not Vishnumaya;

218
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,698
the sister does not say that.

219
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:06,780
But a brother and a sister are never friends.

220
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,780
Now in a group we are sitting here.

221
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,114
Like that, in any group a brother and a sister,

222
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,780
they are, they know that they exist as brothers and sisters

223
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,905
but they don't cling onto one person,

224
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,364
they don't talk to one person,

225
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:24,281
they don't get friendly with that sister.

226
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:28,489
Like once we had a big fate with these Christians once,

227
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,156
I remember, and I must be having at least

228
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:35,489
thirty cousins and four, five brothers I had at that time.

229
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,614
And we went to that function,

230
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,239
and among Indian Christians

231
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:44,614
we have Christians from all kinds of stratas.

232
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:49,114
So there were some vagabonds I think,

233
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,573
they passed some remarks about us,

234
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,614
we sisters, you see.

235
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:56,364
We didn't know we had so many cousins.

236
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:59,780
They all shot out, you see, just like jack-in-the-box,

237
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:04,114
and they all took over and started beating those boys.

238
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,864
And then we realized so many cousins we have.

239
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,364
Otherwise we never knew;

240
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,780
they were somewhere, we were not talking to them much,

241
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,156
we were talking among ourselves, our friends,

242
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,905
we girls were talking to each other.

243
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,030
Suddenly we found we have so many cousins

244
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,738
and so many brothers. It was most surprising

245
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,156
that we should have so many cousins there

246
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:23,239
we did not know.

247
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,030
Immediately they jumped on the protection

248
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,573
of the chastity of their sister,

249
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:31,738
because she is the basis of their chastity.

250
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:37,573
But normally you don't talk to your brother much,

251
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:41,573
nor the brother talks to you so much,

252
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,156
you don't get friendly.

253
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:46,489
But at the time of difficulties, at the time of maryadas,

254
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:51,780
at the time of consulting about something

255
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,698
that is dear to the family, the sister comes in.

256
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,322
Recently My own brother, younger brother,

257
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,364
wrote a letter to Me

258
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,322
because there's a problem in the family.

259
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:04,739
Now My mother is not there, and normally a sister is better

260
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:09,573
because she is easily available to you than the mother.

261
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,322
Mother is so busy with the whole family,

262
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:12,905
the whole work, you know what she's doing.

263
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:16,072
So the sisterly feeling is very important.

264
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:20,698
Now just imagine that our left Vishuddhi is so bad.

265
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,197
It is, of course,

266
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:30,573
because we have never cared for our chastity,

267
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,448
we have not respected our chastity.

268
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,947
In India it is not so.

269
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:40,739
Women and men all respect their chastity very much.

270
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,864
And I've asked some foreign-going boys,

271
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,531
they said that "Though we were doing all wrong things

272
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:49,322
as they were doing, we all the time somehow knew

273
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,156
that we were doing wrong."

274
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,156
I said, "How is it?"

275
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:55,072
He said, "There's something like a sister's relationship."

276
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:01,822
But now I can say that Indian men are also becoming

277
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,281
just like you people,

278
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:06,573
and have lost their power to keep their chastity.

279
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,406
The men must respect their chastity,

280
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:14,281
because they think they do not owe anything to the chastity.

281
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:21,406
And if the basis of your spiritual existence

282
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,573
doesn't exist, you'll collapse in no time.

283
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,989
For that I have many a times said that

284
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:32,156
put your attention on the Mother Earth, the green.

285
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:33,738
Green is the color,

286
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,822
if you put your attention into that

287
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:39,947
then you will be saved

288
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:44,156
from these errors you are committing of adultery

289
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,864
all the time,

290
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,156
your looking at others' sisters,

291
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,322
others' wives, others' daughters.

292
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:53,822
So the relationship

293
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,531
that is now being expressed, as you know,

294
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:57,364
is of a daughter,

295
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,738
of a sister and of a mother,

296
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:09,822
which is a very, very pure relationship.

297
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:16,239
So much so that now, supposing you use your brains too much,

298
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:19,573
then why does your heart catch - have you thought of that?

299
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:24,739
Why does your heart catch when you use right side too much?

300
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,114
What is the reason for catching your heart?

301
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,905
Must understand this, it's the same thing.

302
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:42,489
The relationship of, say, Shiva is to Vishnu in two ways.

303
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:49,780
Firstly Vishnu's wife - the sister, He has married.

304
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,698
All right?

305
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,489
Then who is the sister of Shiva?

306
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:00,197
Shiva's sister is Saraswati.

307
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,780
If you work too much on Saraswati, heart will catch.

308
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,698
It has maryadas.

309
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,322
This is how the intermarriages took place,

310
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:14,573
by which the sister's relationship

311
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:19,905
is worked out to keep your maryadas of your chakras.

312
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,489
If you cross that,

313
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,656
you suddenly get into the left or the right

314
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:27,364
because you have crossed the maryadas of that.

315
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:31,448
Now this sisterly relationship existed

316
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:34,573
in other incarnations also;

317
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,489
like Mohammed Sahib

318
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,448
had a sisterly relationship

319
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:47,114
with - actually what we have to say that

320
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,364
His sister as such was Ali's wife,

321
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:53,698
but She was born to Him as a daughter.

322
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:59,656
So they can be born as the daughter or as the sister.

323
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:03,197
She was born as Nanaka's sister, Nanaki.

324
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,989
She was born as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib.

325
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:14,072
So it could be a sister or could be

326
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,364
the daughter of an incarnation.

327
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:25,947
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.

328
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,114
Now think of it, that those people

329
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:36,698
who cannot understand the importance of chastity,

330
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:42,114
how can they talk of any laws whatsoever?

331
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:48,114
- because "laws" means maryadas,

332
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:53,698
and it has the proper sense

333
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,197
through the power of Vishnumaya.

334
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:02,656
Now you might say that not to steal anybody else's thing

335
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:10,072
is also not proper, because it belongs to somebody else.

336
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:12,698
But who will tell you?

337
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:16,364
Who is the one that is going to tell you that this is wrong?

338
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:18,614
Of course, there is police, but

339
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:20,364
who has told?

340
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:22,114
The lawmakers.

341
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:26,364
Which part of the unconscious has played is the Vishnumaya;

342
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:30,738
because as soon as you steal something you feel guilty.

343
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:35,364
In the law also this word "guilty" is used.

344
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:40,531
And guilty comes from the left side, is Vishnumaya.

345
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:49,030
So how important it is to have a sense of chastity.

346
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,738
But we are very divided people,

347
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,738
and those who have moral chastity

348
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:57,114
may not have material chastity.

349
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:00,780
Those who have got material chastity

350
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,281
may not have moral chastity.

351
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,114
Moral chastity comes first,

352
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:08,531
that's very important,

353
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,905
because it is innate.

354
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:18,489
And if your moral chastity is perfectly nourished,

355
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:24,738
then automatically the material chastity comes in.

356
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,281
But the effect is the same.

357
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:31,822
Whether you do money cheating in Sahaja Yoga

358
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,239
or whether you cheat morally,

359
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,947
your left Vishuddhi will be caught,

360
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:40,114
and the whole problem will start from left Vishuddhi.

361
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:44,114
Now supposing somebody tries to cheat in Sahaja Yoga,

362
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,030
want to take away the money of Sahaja Yoga

363
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,239
or something like that.

364
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:51,738
Immediately his left Vishuddhi will be caught.

365
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,738
As soon as the left Vishuddhi will be caught

366
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,281
he will start behaving in a funny manner,

367
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:58,947
the whole catch will be shown.

368
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:01,322
If you become immoral also

369
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,448
the left Vishuddhi will be caught.

370
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,864
Now the whole guilt part comes from there.

371
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,531
Sin against the Mother could be also an insult,

372
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,780
in any way answering back to Mother.

373
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:18,698
Many people have a habit, I've seen, of saying,

374
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,197
"No, Mother."

375
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,322
"No" is never to be said,

376
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:24,989
because if you say "no"

377
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,364
that means you go to the left Vishuddhi.

378
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,448
The Vishnumaya power will not tolerate your "no"

379
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,739
for anything at all.

380
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:37,114
Many people have a habit of saying this, "No, Mother."

381
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,322
This is not to be done,

382
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:43,448
because once you catch your left Vishuddhi

383
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,364
all your left chakras become weak,

384
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:50,322
because the chastity which is the basis of all the chakras

385
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:52,739
is weak.

386
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:55,448
So how much important it is

387
00:22:55,739 --> 00:23:01,364
to understand the value of left Vishuddhi.

388
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:03,573
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,

389
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,739
and we do not think that it is such an important thing.

390
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,364
But we say, "Oh, left Vishuddhi catching

391
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:10,448
means I'm feeling guilty."

392
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:13,531
We do not understand that "What have I done?

393
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:16,698
I have crossed the limits, that's why is showing there.

394
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:21,239
I've neglected some kind of a morality.

395
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:24,780
I've gone on a wrong path against Mother

396
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,656
and Father, that's why left Vishuddhi's catching."

397
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:33,322
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of the mistakes,

398
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,322
of the wrongs, of the sins.

399
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:38,947
We can't afford to have left Vishuddhi,

400
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:42,239
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have left Vishuddhi.

401
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:45,072
To add to the trouble, they smoke,

402
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:47,072
they take all kinds of things.

403
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:52,989
In India they take what you call tamakhu,

404
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:57,573
is a kind of a - what leaves are these? - tobacco leaves,

405
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:02,448
and they think they have done no wrong.

406
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,739
But left Vishuddhi catches.

407
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:08,947
Left Vishuddhi, in a way, is the gateway

408
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,114
to all kinds of problems for yourself,

409
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:17,448
so be careful not to feel guilty about anything.

410
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:21,406
Moreover it's a very vicious - great vicious circle.

411
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,364
For example, somebody has done something wrong.

412
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:30,156
I have decided that I have to tell them on their face

413
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:32,531
whether they like it or not, this is wrong,

414
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,656
as far as possible. Of course,

415
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:38,156
I try to play sometimes tricks on them to understand,

416
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,656
if they do not understand My telling them - up to a point.

417
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:45,656
And then I tell them that "Now you better get out.

418
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,822
I cannot have you in My body any more."

419
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:49,822
So I throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

420
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,281
Once they're out of Sahaja Yoga at least

421
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,905
My headache is over.

422
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,905
Now what I have seen that

423
00:24:56,156 --> 00:25:01,239
when this negativity starts acting, people,

424
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:05,156
instead of facing it, facing the mistakes that "I am wrong,

425
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:07,698
I should not have done it, it's a wrong thing to do,"

426
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,989
start giving explanations.

427
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,738
Once you start giving explanation,

428
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,738
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like a bloated big lump,

429
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:22,156
and then there's no possibility of curing,

430
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:24,281
no possibility of cleansing.

431
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,322
So people start giving explanation,

432
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:28,738
"Why I did it, why I did this."

433
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:31,406
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

434
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:32,738
to be accepted,

435
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,738
"All right, next time I'm not going to do it,

436
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:36,864
I'm very sorry." But "sorry"

437
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:40,864
seems to be a very difficult word for at least

438
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:42,864
Western Sahaja yogis

439
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,322
and some of the Indian Sahaja yogis also,

440
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:47,739
to say, "Sorry, I'm very sorry."

441
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:51,030
Indians never feel guilty, is a good idea,

442
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:56,322
but they never say sorry, so it's just the same.

443
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:02,656
Now one has to understand

444
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:04,989
that when you have committed a mistake,

445
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,780
you are a human being: to error is human

446
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,739
and to forgive, divine.

447
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:12,239
But you must know that you have erred.

448
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:16,072
If you go on giving explanations then one thing is definite,

449
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:18,780
you do not understand that God knows everything.

450
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:24,239
If He says you have done wrong, then it is a wrong.

451
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:27,448
How can you challenge, how can you say,

452
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:29,489
"This is the reason I did it. That's the reason"

453
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,739
- it's the thing one must understand.

454
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,364
Because this is the power of electricity,

455
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:36,489
you must understand, gives you a shock.

456
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:39,030
It shocks you.

457
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:42,656
And then you realize that "I have done a mistake."

458
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:45,573
So don't create a shock for yourself.

459
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,698
Do not behave in a manner

460
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:50,698
that ultimately you end up with a shock.

461
00:26:51,197 --> 00:26:54,239
It's - of course, the Mother's power is so forgiving,

462
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,739
Sadashiva's power is so forgiving that you are allowed,

463
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,739
and allowed, and allowed

464
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:03,656
to continue with what you are doing, for a while.

465
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:06,322
But it's been told,

466
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:08,698
is explained to you that this is wrong.

467
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:13,322
But supposing you cross your limits absolutely,

468
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:16,197
then suddenly the Vishnumaya appears

469
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:18,531
and the whole thing gets exposed.

470
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,989
In Sahaja Yoga you get exposed.

471
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:29,656
So one must know that though this power is so helpful,

472
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:37,989
so guiding, so improving and nourishing and protecting,

473
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,989
still - up to a point.

474
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:44,322
Otherwise it is She only who exposes you,

475
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:52,072
because She can't bear any more this nonsense from you.

476
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:55,322
So if you go on like that,

477
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:57,448
She'll just see to it that She is exposed.

478
00:27:57,738 --> 00:27:59,072
You have seen people have been doing

479
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:00,531
all kinds of filthy things.

480
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,947
I have known many prime ministers

481
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:05,947
and all these presidents and this and that,

482
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:08,738
when they die - exposed.

483
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:17,739
Nobody says that such and such person was a chaste person.

484
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,656
Very few leaders of nations have got this certificate

485
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:25,030
that they were very chaste people.

486
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:28,738
Chastity is a very, very rare certificate they get.

487
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:32,947
Because once you get a power in life

488
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,197
then you think you have a free hand,

489
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,947
you can be and you can do what you like.

490
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,738
You can be a chaste person,

491
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:44,656
you can be any way unchaste,

492
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,156
you can do what you like.

493
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,656
You become sort of overpowered with this idea that

494
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:54,281
"I have got all the powers, now I am very well placed."

495
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,156
And that becomes a complete delusion for you,

496
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,072
and you forget that chastity is so important.

497
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:06,156
So the higher a person is placed in life,

498
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,322
the higher positions he occupies,

499
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:17,822
the higher what you call the ego-pampering stuff he gets,

500
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:22,281
the more he presses down on the left Vishuddhi.

501
00:29:22,738 --> 00:29:25,822
So such a person escapes into the left Vishuddhi,

502
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,489
because in his heart of hearts,

503
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:30,739
in his unconscious he feels guilty.

504
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,738
And the whole thing goes as a guilt,

505
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:37,156
guilt in the left Vishuddhi.

506
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,739
And when it goes as a guilt in the left Vishuddhi

507
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,738
then it's a difficult situation,

508
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,364
because such a person,

509
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,489
he becomes extremely sensitive.

510
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:49,406
You say anything to that person, he feels more guilty.

511
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:52,531
You try to cure his left Vishuddhi,

512
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:54,822
then he becomes even worse.

513
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:58,197
It's a very bad situation with left Vishuddhi people,

514
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,947
and they are the people who have left Vishuddhi

515
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:03,656
always give explanations.

516
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:07,406
A person who has right Vishuddhi will be arrogant,

517
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:10,905
but left Vishuddhi people have a very sly method

518
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:15,114
of giving answers back and explanation for everything.

519
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,239
Whatever You say, they will say,

520
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,364
"No, Mother, this is this, this is this."

521
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:21,989
This is one thing. Not only, it doesn't end there,

522
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,030
it gives you sarcasm.

523
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:28,239
That's why in the West people never talk straightforward,

524
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,822
it's always sarcastic.

525
00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:33,030
To talk straightforward means they think it's stupid,

526
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:34,698
is unintelligent,

527
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:38,364
if unless and until you talk in a very sarcastic manner

528
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:41,573
which sometimes, you know, it's difficult to reach.

529
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,030
That's how in a very crooked way they talk.

530
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:52,281
And that crookery comes through this left Vishuddhi problem.

531
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,239
If your left Vishuddhi is so bad,

532
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:59,905
you cannot achieve anything that is sweet,

533
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,822
that is beautiful,

534
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,030
that's appreciative.

535
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,573
Left Vishuddhi will never appreciate.

536
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,573
Those who suffer from left Vishuddhi

537
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,989
can never appreciate another person, can never.

538
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:16,989
It will have its own say, it will think, "I'm the best"

539
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,281
because it has to exist,

540
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,239
that problem has to exist, so how?

541
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:25,114
It's a kind of a perverted ego

542
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:26,822
that doesn't want to accept

543
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,448
that anybody can be better than me,

544
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,156
that anybody I have to follow,

545
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:33,156
that I have to take some lessons from another one.

546
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:34,738
I've had many examples;

547
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,698
I see specially people who are with Me,

548
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:39,989
I find they get into left Vishuddhi very fast

549
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,614
because they lack in protocol.

550
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:45,614
Once they start lacking in protocol

551
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,989
they go into left Vishuddhi.

552
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,573
So to be with Me is a blessing, no doubt,

553
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:54,656
but also one has to be very, very careful

554
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:57,406
that you do not cross the protocols.

555
00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:00,656
Do not try to come over-forward,

556
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:02,947
just prancing.

557
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:07,989
Some people have a habit of crossing the limits,

558
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,698
and as soon as you cross the limits

559
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:11,739
left Vishuddhi is created.

560
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:15,114
There should be awe for your Mother,

561
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:17,030
there should be respect for your Mother,

562
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,780
which is guarded by left Vishuddhi.

563
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:26,239
Now this is a very hidden power of Shri Ganesha.

564
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,573
What you call is the power of Ganesha

565
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:35,156
is left Vishuddhi acting like chastity.

566
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:44,489
Ganesha's power are all expressed through left Vishuddhi.

567
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:49,197
So those who believe in Ganesha, in pure innocence,

568
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:52,030
must know that in your everyday-to-day behavior,

569
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,573
in everyday-to-day action,

570
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,780
there should be chastity.

571
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:02,614
Ganesha is expressed as flowers of chastity.

572
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:07,364
And just see, in the divine law if there's no chastity,

573
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,114
how do you delimit people,

574
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:11,448
how do you make all right,

575
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,614
how do you cleanse them,

576
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:15,864
how do you make them evolve?

577
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:20,656
Supposing a tree is growing and there's no limit in it,

578
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:23,239
it just grows like a wild thing,

579
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,573
it has no limits,

580
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:26,114
then what will you get out of it?

581
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:27,322
Nothing.

582
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:31,114
So to make a person higher and higher,

583
00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:32,780
you have to limit it.

584
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,905
My father used to give a very good example of this,

585
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:39,197
that if you take some wheat, the wheat & .

586
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,197
(You please now don't disturb.

587
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:43,197
If you want to go out you can go out,

588
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:47,030
but don't disturb the people, anybody moving about.)

589
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:51,489
This is also another thing is, you see.

590
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,489
All these things are nothing but

591
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:56,780
the upheaval of the left Vishuddhi.

592
00:33:57,322 --> 00:34:02,281
See, all this show-off or disturbing

593
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,281
or trying to be overpowering,

594
00:34:05,864 --> 00:34:08,822
or very forward person or bumptiousness,

595
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:11,197
all these come from left Vishuddhi,

596
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:13,573
because you want to overcome your left Vishuddhi

597
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,114
so you do it.

598
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,114
And then this is added to it.

599
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,739
The more you try to overcome it, the more it is added to it.

600
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,364
Now the father's story I must tell you,

601
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,780
that he said that

602
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,905
you have got the wheat and if you spread it,

603
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,448
it just fritters away like attention does.

604
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,780
But if you put in a gunny bag,

605
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:38,364
in a bag,

606
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,614
you can heap it up and it can achieve a height.

607
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:45,614
In the same way,

608
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,905
if you fritter away your attention without chastity,

609
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,738
it spreads out;

610
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,573
it has no limits, it has no forms,

611
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:55,989
it had no shape.

612
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,656
But if you delimit it,

613
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:02,780
then you become higher and higher and higher,

614
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:07,364
and you can rise higher in your spiritual life.

615
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:12,448
As you are the people who want to lead a very spiritual life,

616
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:19,573
you must understand that left Vishuddhi is to be corrected.

617
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,531
Now, how do you correct your left Vishuddhi?

618
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:27,614
I get sometimes very tired with them,

619
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:29,864
really to be - I get very,

620
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:32,114
I just give them up.

621
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:34,573
Because if they are catching

622
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:36,030
and you tell them "You are catching"

623
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:38,738
they become even worse. What a vicious circle it is.

624
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:40,573
What is the cure for it?

625
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:44,739
How to break the vicious circle? - is by facing it.

626
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:47,864
Should say, "What, you are feeling guilty for what?

627
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,739
You're doing the same mistake again and again,

628
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,448
and still you're doing it."

629
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:57,114
You should give all injections to yourself.

630
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,448
But instead of that they start telling Me,

631
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:03,739
"No, Mother. No, Mother. No, Mother."

632
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,905
You tell yourself, "No, myself.

633
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:10,864
I have done this today, tomorrow I'm going to do it,

634
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,239
day after tomorrow I'm going to do it.

635
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,531
Stop it now, stop." And stop at this point.

636
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:20,531
There you exert your Vishnumaya power.

637
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:24,573
Vishnumaya power has to be neutralized,

638
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,322
if so, by your mistakes;

639
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:34,739
but if it has to be brought back into its power,

640
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,739
you must use Vishnumaya's power

641
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:39,072
by giving yourself shocks.

642
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:43,864
Then only you can do it.

643
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:46,573
So on that point, on the Vishnumaya point

644
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,739
I really fail you.

645
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:50,947
You have to do it.

646
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:56,322
And that's why I was thinking about this puja

647
00:36:56,573 --> 00:37:00,072
that when you people are doing this puja to Me,

648
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:04,989
if I say anything it will create more Vishnumaya in you.

649
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,739
But that's the easiest way to manage things, you see -

650
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,947
"I am feeling guilty" - you're finished.

651
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,739
"I have taken the punishment, I called myself guilty."

652
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,989
It's like in the court the jury says you are guilty

653
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,406
- all right, accept it, "I am guilty," but no punishment,

654
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:24,989
take no punishment.

655
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,322
If you have done wrong, then punish yourself.

656
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,322
Now there are two ways people punish.

657
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:33,531
One is like some people punish them

658
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:36,448
by saying that "I will not have my food."

659
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:39,489
But those people who have a habit of not having food

660
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:42,156
and this thing, can also become aggressive

661
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:44,156
with that kind of a habit to trouble others

662
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:48,489
by not eating food. I mean, human beings are very crooked.

663
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,489
They know how to kill themselves

664
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:52,197
with a crooked knife all the time.

665
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:54,822
So that's not the way you can correct yourself.

666
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:58,072
If you have to correct yourself,

667
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,030
then you have to face yourself in a proper way.

668
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,905
Supposing you have done something wrong,

669
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:09,656
then you should do something that

670
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:11,947
you would like to do normally,

671
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:14,489
and punish yourself.

672
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,364
You should, you should, I am sorry,

673
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:18,281
you should not do something

674
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:20,030
that you would like to do normally.

675
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,030
Like correcting yourself;

676
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:28,406
somebody is, say, very fond of the gardens, of flowers.

677
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,281
When you do some mistake

678
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:33,072
you don't see flowers for some time,

679
00:38:35,156 --> 00:38:37,531
just close your eyes for flowers.

680
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,780
Now there are some people, supposing,

681
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,072
who are fond of singing,

682
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,156
so if you do mistakes then just stop singing.

683
00:38:55,738 --> 00:38:57,698
That's how you have to shock.

684
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:01,780
You must know Vishnumaya is a lightning,

685
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:04,114
and the lecture has to be like that.

686
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:07,738
It cannot be that soft one, as Shri Krishna was.

687
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:10,489
It's a very powerful thing I'm telling you,

688
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:17,614
and may God awaken that power within you of Vishnumaya.

689
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:21,905
It's the most powerful thing that a human being can have,

690
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,864
is the most auspicious thing;

691
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:26,573
you become a holy personality.

692
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:33,239
This is one of the ways of getting God's realization.

693
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,364
It was a nice question aptly asked,

694
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:39,156
right time yesterday,

695
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:42,322
is to establish your chastity

696
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,614
- not by giving bandhans,

697
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:47,573
taking vibrations from Mother and then getting lost,

698
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,698
not that way: you yourself correcting yourself

699
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,573
morning till evening,

700
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:56,698
and facing yourself and not feeling guilty,

701
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,364
and learning new things.

702
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:04,364
All the time is the sister who teaches you,

703
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:07,614
all the time, how to be better and better and better,

704
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,822
not the Mother;

705
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:10,989
because Mother you can say, "No, Mother."

706
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:14,364
To a sister if you say - electricity,

707
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:15,780
all right?

708
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:20,156
Try your fingers in the plug and you will know

709
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:23,197
- no explanations!

710
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,030
With this understanding,

711
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,406
today we are going to do the puja

712
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:38,156
for the establishment of our chastity,

713
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:43,406
chastity of our emotions and chastity of our mind.

714
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:45,739
Now whatever you have done so far,

715
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,489
forget it, forget the past.

716
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,738
That is very important also to forget the past,

717
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,905
because you see that's a very good way of explaining,

718
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:55,406
"Because I had this, that's why it has happened.

719
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:58,156
My mother was like this, that, and my father was like this

720
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:01,489
"Mother, father, everybody you forget now,

721
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:04,614
you belong to this family, which is a holy family.

722
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:08,531
People who are saints

723
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:13,322
sitting here, among them you are.

724
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:17,822
And automatically these laws will start working,

725
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:19,614
and I will not have to tell you

726
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:21,531
whether you be friendly with that person

727
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:24,072
or not friendly with that person.

728
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:29,656
You see, interest in another sex

729
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,364
all the time is not a sign of chastity.

730
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,030
I mean, it's horrid, absolutely ridiculous,

731
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:42,072
you become stupid.

732
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,614
Like some men know so much about what women use,

733
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:47,738
perfumes, this, that. What's the use?

734
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,197
Are you slaves of women, or what?

735
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,531
They become experts on this nonsensical thing.

736
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:57,448
You are men, live like men.

737
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:02,738
And women have to have that sense of chastity

738
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:05,448
within themselves, because they're the powers.

739
00:42:06,322 --> 00:42:09,156
Why are you wanting to become like men?

740
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:11,614
I mean, you are the powers behind them.

741
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,864
And women must look after their chastity.

742
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:18,030
For that I must say,

743
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,156
I must bow to Indian women for that,

744
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:25,905
the way they are humble,

745
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,030
the way they are chaste,

746
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,281
one has to learn - of course there are many

747
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,738
who are not also - but the humility that they have.

748
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:40,738
There's only one category which should not have humility:

749
00:42:42,072 --> 00:42:45,822
that is the incarnations.

750
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:50,489
I cannot have humility, sorry to say.

751
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:52,822
There are certain qualities you can have

752
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:54,698
and enjoy and cherish, I cannot have.

753
00:42:54,905 --> 00:43:00,698
I cannot humble down Myself, cannot do it, I'm sorry

754
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,156
- I'm not supposed to do it.

755
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:08,364
No incarnation was humble;

756
00:43:08,614 --> 00:43:10,030
they cannot,

757
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:13,947
because they have no guilt.

758
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:24,156
I have put so many guilty people in My left Vishuddhi

759
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:28,281
that My ears are getting blocked trying to clear them out.

760
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:30,156
If you can clear out your guilt

761
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:33,614
My ears will be opened out, My trouble will go away.

762
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,030
So please, I request you

763
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,406
to keep your left Vishuddhi all right.

764
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,364
Don't feel guilty, be in the center.

765
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,281
Be in the center, watch yourself and face yourself,

766
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:46,406
shock yourself, correct yourself.

767
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:49,614
Only such people will ascend.

768
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,947
Another way is meditation.

769
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:55,989
With your left hand towards the photograph,

770
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:58,905
with the light there, right hand on the Mother Earth,

771
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:00,780
you can work it out.

772
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,322
Put the light over here,

773
00:44:02,322 --> 00:44:04,156
give a bandhan to your left Vishuddhi,

774
00:44:04,156 --> 00:44:05,114
you can work it out.

775
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:08,780
But these become rituals if you do not do it from your heart.

776
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:12,780
So first of all face it, mentally face it fully,

777
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,489
then do it with these things.

778
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:16,614
Emotionally understand it also,

779
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:21,156
that the emotions you have should have no guilt in it.

780
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,156
So for all our practical purposes

781
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:29,698
we are not to use all such words which shows our guilt

782
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:31,156
- but humility.

783
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:34,905
Humility is very different from a guilty person.

784
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:38,989
Guilty person is the person who is under duress,

785
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:43,364
under pressure, but a humble person is a free person.

786
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:48,239
He is humble in his own freedom, in his own exuberance.

787
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,614
Like the trees, when they are loaded with fruit

788
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:54,531
they just bow to the Mother Earth.

789
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,072
Like, if you go to the sea,

790
00:44:58,072 --> 00:45:02,448
you'll find that all the trees around the sea,

791
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:05,406
specially the coconut trees,

792
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:08,030
all bend towards the sea

793
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:11,822
because the sea has given them that speciality.

794
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:15,656
The water that is in the coconut comes from the sea.

795
00:45:15,656 --> 00:45:20,656
So all of them have that respect,

796
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:23,656
that humility towards the sea.

797
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:30,197
In the same way a person who is not guilty

798
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:33,406
only will be really humble,

799
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:35,406
because guilty people, as I told you,

800
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:39,614
are aggressive by their sarcasm, by their nasty words,

801
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,448
by their answering back, by their explanations.

802
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:49,531
But a humble person is a free person,

803
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,656
free to be humble,

804
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:55,072
free to be kindly,

805
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:57,739
to be gentle, to be compassionate.

806
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:02,531
And that sort of Sahaja yogis you have to be,

807
00:46:02,822 --> 00:46:04,489
so that when people meet you

808
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:06,072
they're impressed by your humility.

809
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:10,448
But humility doesn't have any subservience

810
00:46:10,822 --> 00:46:13,656
- innocence and humility.

811
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:18,738
I, I lack that quality completely.

812
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:20,531
I cannot be humble,

813
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,030
and you should never try to humble Me down

814
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,072
because that is not to be done.

815
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:31,239
But nobody can say in My behavior when they meet Me

816
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,114
that I'm not humble.

817
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,698
I act as a very humble person.

818
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:41,364
I can act as a very humble person but to be very frank,

819
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:45,489
I have no humility of any kind within Me, no humility.

820
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:49,030
Compassion is very different from humility.

821
00:46:49,364 --> 00:46:52,239
Humility is a human quality,

822
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:56,448
is a special quality only the bhaktas have.

823
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,614
Only the bhaktas have, it's such a beautiful quality

824
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:04,573
of taking the showers of bliss.

825
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,698
The one who gives bliss cannot be humble

826
00:47:08,698 --> 00:47:10,780
because it cannot take anything.

827
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,864
It's the only human beings who are humble,

828
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:18,614
and who can take it and achieve it and receive it.

829
00:47:18,864 --> 00:47:24,905
And the person who cannot take is so lonely, so lonely.

830
00:47:25,448 --> 00:47:30,614
Such a person cannot get companionship with anyone,

831
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,489
because it has to give, and give, and give.

832
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:40,030
It's so lonely, and has to face everything oneself.

833
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:44,030
Those who are humble can only become friendly

834
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,489
with each other, can share their problems with each other.

835
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:52,780
I cannot, because you have no solutions.

836
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:55,698
I have to solve My own problem.

837
00:47:55,989 --> 00:48:01,030
So the humility can only help you to articulate

838
00:48:01,322 --> 00:48:03,322
and to have rapport with your friends,

839
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:06,239
everyone, share your difficulties.

840
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:09,322
But again I have to warn you because it always happens,

841
00:48:09,614 --> 00:48:12,780
your humility should not be sympathetic.

842
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,905
Humility is a detached person,

843
00:48:16,905 --> 00:48:19,114
it's a detached quality.

844
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:22,239
It's not a quality that gets attached

845
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,239
to one person or second person.

846
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:27,156
It's a humble style of life

847
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:29,448
where you are not arrogant unnecessarily,

848
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,448
you don't shout at people.

849
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:35,364
But in India we say the cow

850
00:48:35,698 --> 00:48:37,322
is a very humble animal.

851
00:48:37,573 --> 00:48:39,364
It gives its milk,

852
00:48:40,114 --> 00:48:42,072
it provides everything,

853
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:44,239
it doesn't attack anyone.

854
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:49,322
So humility is such a guard for you.

855
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,531
Of course, sometimes people take advantage of humble people,

856
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:53,364
doesn't matter.

857
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,947
As long as you have not lost your humility,

858
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,072
everything is all right.

859
00:48:57,406 --> 00:48:58,905
But people lose their humility.

860
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:00,406
When people try to trouble them

861
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:01,947
they become left-Vishuddhites

862
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:05,156
and then they lose their humility,

863
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:07,656
and that's one thing one should not lose;

864
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:12,030
because if you have to keep connection with the Divine

865
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,614
then you have to be humble.

866
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:16,656
There's no other way.

867
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:19,281
If you are not a humble person

868
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,614
you cannot keep the relationship.

869
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:25,738
See, two qualities, like a plug and the socket.

870
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,905
The plug has to be the plug,

871
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:30,197
the socket has to be socket.

872
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:32,197
In the same way if you have to

873
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:35,072
get something out of the Divine,

874
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,905
you have to be humble people.

875
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:39,947
Through arrogance you will not get anything,

876
00:49:40,364 --> 00:49:43,156
through aggression you'll not get anything,

877
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:46,030
through anything .& Some people also feel that

878
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,406
"I love Mother," but that love is to be expressed

879
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,656
through complete humility.

880
00:49:53,738 --> 00:49:55,614
That's the only way,

881
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:59,822
that's the only channel through which you can approach Me,

882
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:01,905
there's no way out.

883
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:11,406
So we end up today on a very high stage.

884
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:15,156
It's the beginning of God's realization.

885
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:17,614
But you must speed up with Me.

886
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,072
It's not easy to keep speed with Me,

887
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:22,364
so you have to speed up with Me.

888
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:24,489
If you have to go towards God's realization,

889
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,531
first establish your sense of chastity and humility.

890
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,738
May God bless you.
