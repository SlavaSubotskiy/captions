1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
here you are

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,520
in such a great position that you have

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,520
got realization

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,160
that only thing you have to accept

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
the beauty of this

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
great yoga that

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,520
you just enlighten

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,200
your own powers which are

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,440
on these seven chakras now let us see

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,520
the first chakra belongs to the power

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,840
of gauri the power of the

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
mother of shri ganesha

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,960
gauri's power tremendous there aren't

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
they

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
because of her power you have got your

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
realization

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840
now what have we done

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
to enshrine that power within ourselves

19
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,479
today's if it is the first day of

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,400
navratri

21
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,400
let us see what have we done

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
have we been able to develop our

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,759
innocence

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:45,280
within ourselves

25
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,720
when people talk they are so sharp

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,759
how can you be sharp if you are innocent

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,759
they are so bumptious

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,320
how can you be that if you are innocent

29
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,479
people play games how can you do that

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,640
if you are innocent harm each other

31
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,920
how can it be if you are innocent

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,120
so first of all you have to see yourself

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,680
that the power of innocence if it has to

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
live

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
all the rest of the nonsense has to go

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
away

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,560
if you want to have the innocence all

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
that is anti-innocence has to be dropped

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
off

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
i can understand about people who are

41
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
ignorant

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
who have ignorance then in ignorance of

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
course

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,040
how will they talk of innocence but you

45
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
are not ignorant people

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,840
you are knowledgeable you've got your

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,280
enlightenment

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,440
and the power of innocence is so great

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
it makes you absolutely fearless not

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,160
bombshell but fearless

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,360
and the greatest thing of innocence is

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,360
that you are respectful

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,920
the sense of respect

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,560
if it is not developed within you if you

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
cannot

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,040
develop the sense of respect for other

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,239
sahaja yogis

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,519
for other people for the ashrams for the

59
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,040
discipline

60
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
and your own self-respect

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,560
then it is of no use

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
even talking of sahaja yoga because

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
that's the very

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
beginning of it

65
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,959
first you do not respect all right you

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
are bumped us all right

67
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,720
you are in a big

68
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,920
fool's paradise as they call it riding a

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
fast horse

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
all that is there is all right is

71
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,560
forgiven

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,239
but once you have seen the light you

73
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,560
must try to

74
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,840
get rid of all the snakes that you have

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
been holding on

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
is a simple thing

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
in your childlike nature only

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
you can receive the blessings of gauri

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,199
otherwise you cannot

80
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,479
you have to be really childlike

81
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,079
otherwise

82
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,400
it is absolutely useless no use telling

83
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
you

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
anything because you think you are too

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,199
clever

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,360
to such a person who thinks he's too

87
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
clever was this of talking to such a

88
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
person because he already knows

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
everything

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,320
so the first power when you develop you

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,520
must learn to sit on the

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
mother earth first of all

93
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
you must respect the mother earth

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
because the first chakra is made out of

95
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,960
the mother earth

96
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,680
try to be more settle down with yourself

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,680
on mother earth

98
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,960
under respect see the trees

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,680
when they get their flowers

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
they are not so respectful but when they

101
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,479
are leading by

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,199
the fruits they bow down

103
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
to mother earth

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
in the same way when you have got the

105
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,840
fruits

106
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,840
of sahaja yoga you all must bow down

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:35,360
and innocence has a special capacity

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,360
to make a person extremely peaceful

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,080
extremely peaceful all the

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,840
anger temper violence

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,560
if a person doesn't have innocence

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,560
it cannot

113
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,400
come in you because the person who is

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,600
not innocent

115
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,240
is either sly or

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
aggressive

117
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
he cannot have peace within his heart

118
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
but an innocent person is not bothered

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,479
innocently he lives

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,520
enjoys everything in complete

121
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
peace and harmony

122
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:26,080
but this violence comes

123
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,319
when a person becomes clever

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
he thinks i am so clever the another one

125
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,000
is so stupid

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,840
i have a right to shout at that person

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,600
and the one who is not innocent is

128
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,520
never wise he may be to look at look

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,400
sharp but he's not wise

130
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,800
wisdom comes only with innocence and how

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
much

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
wisdom have you gathered

133
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,000
that is what one has to say when

134
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,199
your power

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,319
of innocence increases wisdom

136
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,479
is apparent people say that fellow is

137
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,800
very wise

138
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,560
for example if somebody is crying about

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
his wife

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,080
a wise person we could say obama just

141
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
look at this

142
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,880
still busy with his wife another one is

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
crying about his house or something he

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
say oh

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
look at this one still busy with the

146
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080
house

147
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
there is no end to it

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,479
i have known people who get

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,160
so swollen up

150
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,280
that they think they must give a big

151
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
lecture for one hour

152
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,240
on sahaja yoga unless and until they

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,560
have given one hour lecture

154
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,759
they do not think their ego has

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,520
manifested itself fully

156
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,080
but a wise person he doesn't have to

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,160
talk

158
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,160
or speak or do anything

159
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:14,879
he impresses his silence

160
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,680
his wisdom on others much more easily

161
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
and that is what we have to see have we

162
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
been able

163
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,199
to discipline ourselves because our

164
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,919
growth is very

165
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
much in the beginning of it you have to

166
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,120
grow

167
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
quite a lot

168
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,159
and people don't understand this point

169
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,519
in an atmosphere of egoistical

170
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,560
temperament that you have to grow

171
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,919
you have not yet grown

172
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,919
you have to grow a lot

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,519
and when you grow you find this wisdom

174
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:00,560
really fragrant with compassion

175
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,560
your wisdom is fragrant with compassion

176
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
such beautiful compassion

177
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,760
can emit through your being

178
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
that anybody who comes in contact with

179
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,399
you

180
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,399
will feel your auspiciousness

181
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,200
but again

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,640
you must give due respect to your

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
self-realization

184
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,640
and to yourself that is the first thing

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,839
you have to do is to meditate

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,200
we are not drinking we do not have

187
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,320
hangovers

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
we don't sleep late

189
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,800
so why shouldn't we decide today that

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
every morning i'll get up and do my

191
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
meditation

192
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,720
and while meditating i must concentrate

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
on myself and not on others

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
and see for myself what is catching

195
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680

lecture

205
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,600
think of the primordial kundalini

206
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,240
she acts in the mother earth she acts in

207
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
the

208
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,279
universe she acts in the

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,040
animals she acts in the matter

210
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,760
she acts in the human beings and now she

211
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
acts in you

212
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,800
she is the one who decides

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,079
the face and the figure that you are

214
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
going to have

215
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,920
she is the one who decides what child

216
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
you should have

217
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,240
she is the one who gives you a

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,880
particular type of a child that you need

219
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,200
she is the one who has got you all these

220
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
beautiful children

221
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,959
she is the one who has given you these

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,480
sparkling faces and sparkling eyes

223
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,880
all this she has done for you but what

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,839
about the power that you have

225
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
within yourself how much have you

226
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,200
manifested that

227
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,720
so try to understand that

228
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,320
it is you who has to grow it is you

229
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,079
who has to manifest these powers

230
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,240
manifestation of the power

231
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,240
i don't know how far you have understood

232
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,800
when a person who has gauri's power

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
as soon as he enters a hall or any place

234
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:57,839
everybody's kundalini

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:57,839
rises just to salute

236
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,120
when you have gauri's power then you

237
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:11,920
stand out because you have that

238
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,279
innocent lustless greedless

239
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,480
beautiful sparkling eyes and wherever

240
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
you turn your eyes

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,480
even one glance would raise the

242
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
kundalini immediately

243
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,519
people who suffer from cancer suffer

244
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
from this disease that is it

245
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,880
all can be cured in no time if you have

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,320
developed only

247
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:42,000
one power of gauri

248
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,959
all your problems can be solved

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
negativity will go away and you'll

250
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,360
become

251
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
like a lotus

252
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,120
beautiful fragrant

253
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,959
overpowering all kinds of negativity

254
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,040
here it is

255
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:08,800
that fellow just touched me

256
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
and now i have become egoistical

257
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,760
if there is one fellow who is egoistical

258
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
he just talks to another person the

259
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
person goes egoistical

260
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
i mean this is not the way to be

261
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
sensitive you have to be sensitive to

262
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,680
god

263
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,040
and not to bad things but we

264
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,279
are more akin more

265
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,279
vulnerable to bad than to good

266
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,839
so the power the power of assimilation

267
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
of good

268
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:45,920
the power of emission of good

269
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,839
all these powers are just in

270
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,839
your complete reach

271
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,600
but all this should not become a praise

272
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,760
but should become a kind of a challenge

273
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,839
a kind

274
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,839
of a beautiful curiosity

275
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,680
and an advancement for you

276
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:16,079
that is why my humble request is

277
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,440
that you must learn

278
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440

279
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,480

281
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,760

and in our ascent let us with full

288
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,519
