1
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:04,691
All these years

2
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:14,600
I have been waiting for this day.

3
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:27,881
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

4
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:39,514
so is a very important turning point

5
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:53,433
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

6
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:57,923
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

7
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:07,044
And so now is a new change has to come

8
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:12,382
and you can see the announcement.

9
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:30,750
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

10
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:40,165
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

11
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:45,314
We are collectively conscious.

12
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:57,135
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

13
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:05,669
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

14
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:14,439
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

15
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:25,477
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

16
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:31,841
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

17
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:38,610
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

18
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:57,367
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

19
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:01,375
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

20
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:07,848
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

21
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:21,729
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

22
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:28,359
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

23
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,365
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

24
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:38,494
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

25
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,886
All the time they are helping you.

26
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:44,955
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

27
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:49,246
they are using them at the right time.

28
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:58,049
 Now be confident that you have powers.

29
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:10,061
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

30
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,989
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

31
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,884
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

32
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:30,404
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

33
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:38,101
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

34
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:42,700
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

35
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:47,594
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

36
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,267
and the new character is announcement.

37
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:58,767
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

38
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:04,734
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

39
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:08,253
Now you have to all start talking about it,

40
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,018
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

41
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:18,137
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

42
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:25,841
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

43
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:29,867
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

44
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:35,073
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

45
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:40,369
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

46
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,325
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

47
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:48,455
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

48
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:55,167
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

49
00:13:55,368 --> 00:14:01,583
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

50
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:08,444
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

51
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:13,938
and very different type of people.

52
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,207
Now that assumption has to be there.

53
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:28,856
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

54
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:34,491
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

55
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:40,705
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

56
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:44,297
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

57
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:51,628
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

58
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,102
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

59
00:14:56,303 --> 00:15:02,865
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

60
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:08,132
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

61
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:22,653
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

62
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,948
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

63
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,046
now leave them in the water.”

64
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,442
His attention was here and there,

65
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:33,625
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

66
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:37,255
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

67
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:41,846
and lasted for five days more after that.

68
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:45,377
Then he was convinced.

69
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:55,075
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

70
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:59,469
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

71
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,323
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

72
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:08,622
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

73
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:13,079
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

74
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,055
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

75
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:24,234
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

76
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:31,841
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

77
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:36,789
for your countries and for the whole world.

78
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,416
Now, assume your powers.

79
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:46,523
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

80
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:51,405
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

81
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:58,003
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

82
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:03,364
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

83
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:07,775
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

84
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,939
Now you have to count your powers:

85
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:16,571
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

86
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,470
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

87
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:25,858
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

88
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,761
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

89
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:32,806
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

90
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,526
and how you are going to work out.

91
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:44,311
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

92
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:49,905
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

93
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:54,193
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

94
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:59,425
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

95
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,656
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

96
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:06,827
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

97
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:10,473
that I have put many a times before
you people,

98
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,520
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

99
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:16,316
Now don’t have diffidence.

100
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:21,191
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

101
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:25,601
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

102
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:28,150
This work is not going to be done
by special people

103
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,101
because they are suffering from ego.

104
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:35,866
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

105
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:42,780
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

106
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:47,102
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

107
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:51,708
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

108
00:18:51,909 --> 00:19:03,267
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

109
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:07,035
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

110
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,813
any animal you could think of.

111
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:15,687
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

112
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:22,830
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

113
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:29,774
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

114
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:35,066
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

115
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:38,019
So many letters of confessions come to me,

116
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,133
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

117
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:45,637
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

118
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:49,888
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

119
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,250
I am a Maha Yogi.”

120
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,197
This is the confession you have to make.

121
00:19:57,398 --> 00:20:01,454
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

122
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:05,413
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

123
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:08,997
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

124
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:14,136
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

125
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:19,612
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

126
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:26,816
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

127
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:36,758
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

128
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,045
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

129
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,271
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

130
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:46,057
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

131
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,334
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

132
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:52,152
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

133
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,218
running after something that is a mirage

134
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,540
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

135
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,449
We have to openly say it, this thing.

136
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,334
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

137
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:07,124
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

138
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:10,110
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

139
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:16,107
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

140
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:21,686
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

141
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:24,599
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

142
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,844
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

143
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:32,791
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

144
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:42,800
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

145
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,109
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

146
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,811
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

147
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:55,323
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

148
00:21:55,524 --> 00:22:01,159
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

149
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,316
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

150
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:12,507
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

151
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,599
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

152
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,573
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,559
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

154
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,302
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

155
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:34,259
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

156
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,815
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

157
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:40,790
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

158
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:45,171
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

159
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:50,881
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

160
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:57,150
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

161
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:02,988
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

162
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:07,744
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

163
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:13,900
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

164
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,369
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

165
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,671
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

166
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:28,171
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

167
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:31,591
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

168
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,810
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

169
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:36,464
for every small little nonsensical things.

170
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,682
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

171
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:40,905
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

172
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:44,454
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

173
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,025
they are not going to come out.”

174
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:51,602
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

175
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,878
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

176
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,964
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

177
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,247
You are not entangled with anyone.

178
00:24:00,448 --> 00:24:03,258
You are not any way attached to anyone.

179
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:07,205
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

180
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,629
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

181
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,603
your country and ultimately the world.

182
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:21,951
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

183
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:25,296
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

184
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,631
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

185
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:31,551
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

186
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:37,180
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

187
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:42,703
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

188
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:45,199
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

189
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,370
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

190
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,872
But there is all knowledge within you.

191
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,335
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

192
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,468
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

193
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:02,419
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

194
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,790
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

195
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:11,264
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

196
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:16,329
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

197
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,583
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

198
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:24,144
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

199
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,601
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

200
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:30,603
But these are very, very mundane things

201
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:34,054
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

202
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:38,761
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

203
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,227
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

204
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:43,783
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

205
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:47,255
whether you are a child or a grown up.

206
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:51,470
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

207
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:56,383
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

208
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:59,462
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

209
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:02,378
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

210
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,037
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

211
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:10,965
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

212
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:14,306
is a commitment and complete involvement.

213
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,985
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

214
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,867
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

215
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:24,373
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

216
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:28,343
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

217
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:31,452
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

218
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,946
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

219
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:38,246
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

220
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,605
The whole attention should be on that.

221
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:46,430
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

222
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:51,434
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

223
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:55,278
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

224
00:26:55,479 --> 00:27:00,349
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

225
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,655
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

226
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:07,515
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

227
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:13,124
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

228
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:16,120
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

229
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:21,054
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

230
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:24,704
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

231
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:26,901
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

232
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:31,607
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

233
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:35,092
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

234
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:39,907
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

235
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:48,901
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

236
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:53,049
because attention which was involved
into negative things

237
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,546
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:27:58,747 --> 00:28:02,971
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

239
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:06,142
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

240
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:08,722
then we should think that you are still
backdated

241
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:15,860
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

242
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:20,433
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

243
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:27,456
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

244
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:32,402
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

245
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:37,738
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

246
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:45,469
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

247
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,236
You just experiment and see for yourself.

248
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,088
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

249
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,147
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

250
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:57,754
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

251
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:02,949
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

252
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,234
Now those days are gone!

253
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:10,233
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

254
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:15,932
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

255
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:27,458
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

256
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,469
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,782
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

258
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:36,326
You can eat the way you want to eat.

259
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:41,554
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

260
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:50,625
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

261
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:54,485
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

262
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:59,422
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

263
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,900
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

264
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,596
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

265
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:14,038
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

266
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:17,668
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

267
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:21,816
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

268
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:26,297
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

269
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:28,748
and we have to work it out that way.

270
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:31,732
Today we have here people from all over
the world

271
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,053
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

272
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:39,191
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

273
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:44,472
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

274
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:52,174
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

275
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:56,414
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

276
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:59,593
May God bless you all.

277
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:14,951
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

278
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:17,597
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

279
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:20,215
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

280
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,721
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

281
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:29,012
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

282
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:33,391
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

283
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:37,852
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

284
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:43,636
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

285
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:49,036
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

286
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:56,564
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

287
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:03,081
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

288
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:09,570
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

289
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:14,391
But only thing what you need is a courage

290
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,513
and a complete commitment to go forward

291
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:27,949
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
