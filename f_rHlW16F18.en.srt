3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,680
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
They had planned everything.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,960
They had all the arrangements made

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,640
and the sari was missing.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,480
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
so now what to do?

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,600
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,800
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,160
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,120
otherwise we can have it later.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,200
But I was least disturbed,

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,320
least upset.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,800
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,400
But if you have a mental conception,

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,560
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,800
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,720
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,880
But that is what we cannot do.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,880
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,680
This is what it is.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,440
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,880
That’s one of the things.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,720
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,360
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
because we make a mental projection.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,360
Mentally we calculate something.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,680
This has to be.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,200
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,840
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,560
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,400
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
only about two o’clock.

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,720
He said, “Why not in the morning?” “I don’t think it will be feasible.”

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,120
So this is how you become avyagra.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,680
Vyagra means person who is worried.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
The one who is not worried.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,640
So we worry because of two things.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
Future doesn’t exist.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,080
If you have made up your mind that this should happen in the future,

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,840
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,440
But you have not made any mental picture,

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,760
you will see what comes on the scene.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,480
You’ll watch whatever appears.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,280
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,920
what’s going to happen.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,520
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,240
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,320
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,560
and we are not having it.”

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
So you are upset.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,240
What difference does it make?

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,600
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,880
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,560
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,880
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,200
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,840
We really decorated ourselves well.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
We were all ready for the puja,

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,400
we were sitting here for the puja,

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,920
and now what has happened!

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,520
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,320
I knew what was coming.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,120
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,760
I’m busy with Myself.

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,200
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,920
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,920
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,200
In India people come.

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
They keep so much money for buying things.

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,200
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
what you call traders.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
The customs are so kind, I mean

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,480
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,920
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,920
And then they have a mental picture,

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,640
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,760
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

83
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,600
So then they might go to spend some money.

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,440
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,120
It has happened with all of you.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,960
So they go and buy something.

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,960
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,480
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,680
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
How many pounds you paid for that?

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Gavin: Forty pounds.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,640
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,280
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,440
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,040
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,680
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,840
They thought they’ve bought something great.

100
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,080
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

101
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,480
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,360
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,920
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,440
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,800
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

107
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,200
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

108
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,400
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

109
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,840
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

111
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,920
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,240
He said, “What is the price?” I said, “Forty pounds.”

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,320
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,960
And he bought it for forty pounds.

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,480
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,240
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,920
And I found it out that,

118
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,880
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

119
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,600
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,840
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,560
And if you start making it flexible then

122
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,160
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,760
very early. Now he’s different.

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,840
So if you become flexible,

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,720
then what happens you see the joy of it.

126
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,400
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,720
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

128
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
And you can never enjoy it,

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,600
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,000
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,840
You see it is all your own creation.

132
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,880
The mental projection is your creation,

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,840
and also the destruction is your creation.

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,480
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
But who does that is Mahamaya,

136
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,840
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,080
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

138
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,080
I have to go to Birmingham.

139
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,520
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

140
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,320
After some time you will find that it’s impossible to do something,

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,840
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,400
Because whenever you will try to do something,

143
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,520
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

144
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,400
If not, then it will make you realize

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,640
what is important, what you’ve missed.

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,120
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

147
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,400
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,640
What to do? Now where to go?”

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,840
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

150
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,240
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

151
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,800
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,880
for days together. I just see that there.

153
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:43,360
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

154
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,120
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,680
at any cost.

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Then that acts as a guide

157
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,120
and you understand the flexibility

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,120
of all these worldly, transitory things.

159
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
They are all changeable,

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,880
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.
