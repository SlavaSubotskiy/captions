1
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:12,629
I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the
very outset we have to understand that truth

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,439
is what it is. We can not conceptualize it.
We can not organize it and we can not know

3
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,260
it at human awareness. If we had known that
truth at human awareness there would have

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,840
been no problem. There would have been no
second opinion and there would have been no

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,690
quarrel, no problems and we all would have
been in the realm of peace and joy. But what

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,560
we see today is that we are moving towards
some sort of derailment and we do not know

7
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:25,829
where we are going and what is the end of
our civilization.

8
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,460
These are modern times and special times where
so many are aware of this kind of a destructive

9
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:49,060
force working on us and suddenly they have
become alerted and they want to know what

10
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,060
is beyond it. What is the truth? As I have
already stated that you can not know the truth

11
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:08,090
at human awareness. Of course, whatever I
am going to tell you, you have to keep an

12
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,090
open mind about it. Like Scientist you must
listen to Me as if it's some sort of a hypotheses.

13
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,700
But If I prove it then I am sure as honest
people you have to accept because it is for

14
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,790
your benevolence, it is for the benevolence
of this country, benevolence of the whole

15
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,250
world.

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,250
It's a understanding that I want you to be
at, that we have to know something more about

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,500
ourselves and about the whole collective problem
that is today before us. So the knowledge

18
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,790
that I am going to give you about is the knowledge
of the roots. You have the knowledge of the

19
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,200
tree that the civilization has grown like
a very, very big tree and if we do not know

20
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,340
our roots this civilization can be completely
destroyed. In the eyes of the divine no body

21
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:33,180
is divided like Indians, Canadians, English.
They are all the same creation of the divine

22
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,290
power. Now we talk of God, we talk of Love,
I was reading God is love. But by saying that

23
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,890
why should people believe you? Is there God
or not? Is it true or not? We have to establish

24
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,790
it. We have to prove it and unless and until
we prove it, it is not going to be accepted

25
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,930
by the progeny. Nobody is going to take it
as if some sort of a blind faith. All right

26
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,819
you were born in this religion so you follow
it whether it is Christianity, Hinduism, Islam

27
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,150
or anything.

28
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,150
So we have to awaken ourselves into that new
awareness by which we can know the absolute

29
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,130
truth and we can know that divine power which
is surrounding us. All this compartments that

30
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,700
we have made around ourselves will break and
we'll see the dawn of a new era where we will

31
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,820
know that all of us are capable of achieving
that great height of awareness. Of course,

32
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,130
you can not pay for it. Nowadays there are
so many in the market who are selling divine

33
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:06,690
gifts. You can not sell it. As Christians
we have to realize that Christ didn't sell

34
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,520
anything. On the contrary, he took a big hunter
to hit the people who were selling things

35
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,520
at the gate of the temple. So those people
who are selling or marketing things can not

36
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:28,790
be anywhere near divinity because divine doesn't
know money. Money is a creation of human being

37
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,130
and this is where I fail to see in the West
a response to Sahaja Yog. I mean actually

38
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:48,889
people told Me that we can not understand
anything which does not require money. We

39
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,930
have to little bit get out of this and understand
that divine can not be purchased, can not

40
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,870
be sold, it is just to be enjoyed.

41
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,870
There is a system built-in within us. I don't
know if they have shown you ... yes, it is

42
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,180
there. Inside ourselves there is a very beautiful
system built-in during our evolutionary process.

43
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,620
One by one gradually it was built-in within
us and that is how now we have become human

44
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,620
beings. There is a little bit more gap we
have to cross over so that we jump into that

45
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:41,530
new awareness. As they must have told you
about, that there is a power within us, which

46
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,470
is called as the Kundalini. And if it is awakened,
it passes through six centers, piercing through

47
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,330
our fontanel bone area and gives you Self
Realization, meaning like this instrument

48
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,900
is here and unless and until it is connected
to the mains it has no meaning. In the same

49
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:14,900
way we are to be connected to that force which
has created us. And that has to be, that has

50
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:24,530
to extremely simple because it is so vital.
Like our breathing is so important, so it

51
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,320
is so vital and it is absolutely free. We
don't have to go and read books for that.

52
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,169
Especially happening of this Kundalini is
an extremely easy thing and it works out very

53
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:47,169
fast and in thousands and thousands of people
it has worked and I am sure in Canada it has

54
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,199
to work. It is rather the desire to become
a Self-Realized soul than anything else that

55
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,340
is important. If you have a strong desire
to be connected with that divine power by

56
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,630
which you know absolute truth. That's all
is needed and it works so fast because this

57
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,320
power is the power of pure desire. All our
desires that we seek are not satiable, in

58
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:38,490
general. One desire gets satisfied we run
after another, another desire gets satisfied

59
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,490
we run after another. So now there is a desire
within us which if is satisfied then we get

60
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,180
the satisfaction that we wanted.

61
00:08:53,180 --> 00:09:00,180
With this awakening of the Kundalini, which
has been worked out now for eighteen years

62
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,790
because I have been working for the last eighteen
years, I should say twenty years as such because

63
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,790
I started my work in 1970. We have seen that
people get cured of incurable diseases. How

64
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,870
does it happen, that these centers which are
the sources of energy within us are exhausted

65
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,870
when we use them too much either on the left
or on the right. As the result of that exhaustion

66
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,870
causes physical, mental, emotional diseases
from which we suffer. So now supposing you

67
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:46,149
have any physical disease that physical disease
can be cured if energy supplied to that part

68
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:54,810
of the body. So when the Kundalini rises this
center gets nourished which is being exhausted

69
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,460
and when the Kundalini is connected to the
mains, all the time the energy is flowing

70
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:09,460
within you, you get all right. And there are
diseases, which are somatic and there are

71
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,750
diseases, which are psycho. That is the diseases
are caused by, supposing you go to a wrong

72
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,740
guru there will be a problem, a person who
spoils your psyche. There are so many ways

73
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,740
these days we spoil our psyche, drugs and
other things that we do which spoil the psyche

74
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,820
and the person start going into the habit
of getting more and more dominated by those

75
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
habits.

76
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,100
So when the Kundalini rises She brings the
attention in the center, by which the left

77
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,100
side habits are cured. And so your psychic
troubles are also cured. Your habits are cured

78
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,810
and then there is another type of disease
we have, what we call as psychosomatic, these

79
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,810
are the diseases like cancer, say Aids, all
viruses, all kinds of multiple sclerosis and

80
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:15,089
all such diseases, they are also caused by
the imbalance in your attention, by the imbalance

81
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,350
in your being. So when you come into balance
these can be cured, very easily without taking

82
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:29,070
any medicines, without going to any doctor,
without doing anything special.

83
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:35,190
The whole system is built-in within you, which
works it out. But you have to take it up seriously

84
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,100
because supposing you have to go for medicine.
I don't know what is the course here is. But

85
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,140
in India if you have to do medicine you have
to put in really fourteen to fifteen years,

86
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,980
precious fourteen-fifteen years of life to
get only a graduation. But for this you don't

87
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,980
have to because once the Kundalini rises and
you get balanced and then you feel the joy

88
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,890
and the peace within yourself. Gradually you
settle down and you become a master. You become

89
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,839
yourself knowledgeable because on your finger
tips you start feeling the cool breeze and

90
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,839
you can feel it in another person, what's
the matter with his Chakras or what is the

91
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,839
problem he is facing, on your finger tips
and it's all said in Quran, imagine, Mohammed

92
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,670
Saab has said that at the time of resurrection
your hands will speak, of course the Muslims

93
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,790
are not worried about the future part, they
want to just talk about the past and they

94
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,510
don't want to think of resurrection, same
about the Christians. Christ has said I will

95
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,810
send you the Holy Ghost. But they are not
looking out for the Holy Ghost. Same about

96
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,310
Hinduism, in every religion it is said that
such and such time will come when you will

97
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,890
get your Self-Realization. But people are
not looking for that because those who are

98
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,000
in-charge are money oriented. And they want
to mislead you by saying that if you don't

99
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,470
do this you are a sinner, if you don't do
that is a sinner but they don't give any solutions

100
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,040
to the problem and there is a very big solution
within us, this one and that really helps

101
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,040
us to overcome all this ignorance which is
created by the vested interest.

102
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,470
Now this Kundalini when it rises it as I told
you it solves your physical, mental, emotional

103
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,470
problems, also it solves your social problems
because you start understanding the relationship

104
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:51,060
of other people. Like, now, you are sitting
here and there is no light. We don't know

105
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,990
how we relate to each other. But when there
is light we can see for ourselves how we are

106
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,209
related, how we are trodding on another's
freedom, how we are behaving and the whole

107
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:09,209
thing becomes a very enlightening experience
and that enlightenment is not harsh, it's

108
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,680
beautiful, it is love. And, then you realize
that you have got the power to feel like a

109
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,519
computer the absolute truth. You can feel
it on your fingertips what's wrong with you,

110
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,140
what's wrong with others. Now if you know
how to correct it you are all right, not only

111
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,470
that but you become a powerful personality,
a dynamic personality without feeling any

112
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:47,209
tension about it. Tension comes because you
have imbalances but when you are balanced

113
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,880
and when you are connected to the mains and
all the time the energy is flowing into you

114
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,880
there is no question of tensions. We have
no tensions and you are in a joyous condition

115
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,970
because you become Self-Realized means you
become the truth that is that you are the

116
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,579
Spirit. You become the Spirit. And when you
become the Spirit, the Spirit as it is said,

117
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:18,579
it's a fact that is the source, first of all
of knowledge. Like a person comes, say, it's

118
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,019
happened, I've seen many people who came from
jail, they have no credibility of any kind,

119
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,529
they wear some sort of a funny dress, appear
in the square and people just start calling

120
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,829
him a guru and such a guru starts minting
money out of you and head along people go

121
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:42,829
towards that person and think it is a very
big thing. Another one comes and says that

122
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,320
I am such and such and I have these powers
and that power you just believe into that

123
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,240
person, pay him money and get lost.

124
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Like these there are no norms to find out
what is the truth and what is not the truth

125
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,279
but of course, you can find out one thing,
that a person who takes money, how can he

126
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:13,279
be related to God? How can he be related to
Divine? Anything that works on money cannot

127
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:20,850
be relationship with God. Of course, now for
example, this hall has to be, say, hired,

128
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,490
all right, the Canadian Sahaja Yogis, we have
many have hired it. Formally, in the beginning

129
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,510
I used to hire them but now they are hiring
it, that's a different point but for Self-Realization

130
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:40,510
you cannot pay. That happening is absolutely
a living process of our evolution. And this

131
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:48,779
evolution, that we are at a human level we
haven't paid anything. So why should we pay

132
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:57,579
for anything that beyond this. It is a living
process, of a living energy, of a living God.

133
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,970
So one has to understand, first of all, that
at a very ordinary level also that you can

134
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:13,899
not pay for God. You can not pay for Divine.
You can not purchase it and the second is

135
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,600
you can not put any effort. It's an effortless
happening, just like sprouting of a seed.

136
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,140
It is an effortless happening which takes
place and when it takes place, then you just

137
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,090
know yourself, you certify yourself. You don't
have to have others to certify that this is

138
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,390
this, this is that. And you don't take false
certificate. For example, somebody might say,

139
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,030
"All right, I am born again." By taking such
a certificate you do not become. It is not

140
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:53,559
that any organization can give a certificate.
It's a state of be-ing. You have to be that

141
00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:00,559
in that state, only, honestly you have to
be that otherwise just to say that I am such

142
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,640
and such, it's cheating yourself. What's the
use? It's not going to help you. It's not

143
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,460
going to help others.

144
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:15,370
So first of all you must understand that it
is the becoming that is important. It's not

145
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,440
what people are saying about themselves, talking
about themselves. Like there are some people,

146
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,299
the other day I met who were selling lots
of Geeta. I asked what's the use of reading

147
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,340
Geeta? It's all bookish knowledge. To read
Geeta also you have to have Self-Realization.

148
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,710
And then I met some people who were selling
Bibles. Now we have been selling Bibles for

149
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,710
ages. What's the use? To read Bible also,
to understand Christ also, you have to have

150
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,320
Self-Realization. Otherwise you can not understand
what He said and all of them have said one

151
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,760
thing that you must have your second birth.
You are to be born again. But that again one

152
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,510
can use it as a placard saying we are born
again. So we should not cheat ourselves. What's

153
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,820
the use of cheating ourselves? Tomorrow some
disease comes in, some trouble comes in, tomorrow

154
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,350
our children take to drugs or do something
wrong, they go and murder people, all kinds

155
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:17,350
of violence then who is responsible? We, because
we have avoided to know about the truth and

156
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,200
it's all there built-in within us, it's just
there, which we have to have.

157
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,640
So now, the first quality of the Spirit is
that you become knowledgeable, Knowledgeable

158
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,220
about anything. For example, somebody says
that there is no God. Say, in Russia I went,

159
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,980
of course, the Russians are some or other,
the government is horrible but the people

160
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,809
are really their attention is so good that
they just touched it, and thousands and thousands.

161
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:49,419
You won't believe that in Moscow I never had
less than fourteen thousand people or Leningrad

162
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,150
same thing. In Kiev I had nothing less than
five thousand to six thousand people. And

163
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:01,070
the Government itself took it so seriously
that, I mean they invited about six hundred

164
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,710
doctors. I read it in the paper they have
put it only three hundred, it may sound big

165
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,460
but the fact is about six hundred doctors
came in and two hundred great scientists who

166
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,460
have done Sputnik and all that and they all
surprisingly asked for one thing 'Mother give

167
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,360
us Realization. We want to have our Self-Realization.'

168
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,789
So what I feel, whatever I've read about Russian
writers is that there has been always a soul

169
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,480
searching within themselves. If you read any
one of them you will find there is a soul

170
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,789
searching and they find out what am I doing?
Is it correct? Why should I do it? What is

171
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:43,640
the problem? And that soul searching within
themselves is because they have no choices,

172
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,400
like we have here in our countries all kinds
of freedom. We waste our energy in finding

173
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,150
out what breakfast we will have, what lunch
we will have, what dinner we have, what sort

174
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,350
of a blouse we should wear. I mean such a
lot of waste of energy, it's a joyless pursuit.

175
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,330
While they don't have that chance not that
they are not well off, I would say they dress

176
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,549
up well, they have good clothes. They live
well. They have all nice houses. Everybody

177
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:14,799
who is married gets a house. But they always
felt that they are not free to get to their

178
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,000
Spirit. And that's what they were struggling.
As soon as they saw Me, there is no place

179
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,590
for false gurus. Nobody wants them. When I
spoke to them in one of the seminars they

180
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,470
had a yoga seminar, when I walked out everybody
came out and there were other gurus who had

181
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:37,210
come, nobody was there in the hall to talk
to them. They are so keen and so alert that

182
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,210
they know that you can not pay for it. And
there is no hanky panky about it just telling

183
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:49,809
stories this will happen that will happen.
And now in all Eastern Block you will be surprised

184
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:56,660
Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast. Bulgaria
we had fifteen thousand people, fifteen thousand

185
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,549
people in Bulgaria, so you can imagine. I
have to also go to Romania, I've not been

186
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:05,169
there but there are, those Sahaja Yogis who
went there have written to Me that they got

187
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,919
five thousand people. Sahaja Yogis got it.
So you can imagine how fast they are moving

188
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,280
and the day may come they might become very
powerful people than we are.

189
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:22,590
We have become weak. We have become very weak
internally. Externally we have money, we have

190
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,200
good roads, good telephones, everything but
internally we are weak because first of all

191
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,490
we can not get over our habits. Secondly there
are all kinds of negative forces working on

192
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:40,120
us. And we are so vulnerable we do not know
how to fight it out. So it's better that we

193
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,410
become the Spirit to know the knowledge, to
have the knowledge about what is good and

194
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,710
what is bad.

195
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:53,710
The second thing about Spirit is that when
it comes into your attention you become enlightened,

196
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,250
in the sense there is light and you see the
truth. For example, you are standing with

197
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,650
a snake in your hand and it's all darkness,
you can't see, I tell you it's a snake throw

198
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:12,340
it away but you will not listen to Me. You
will say why, why, what's wrong. I mean many

199
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,900
people have told Me what's wrong, what's wrong
if you are doing this what's wrong, till that

200
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,370
snake bites them they will hold it on. So
you put on the light. As soon as you put on

201
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,600
the light they will drop the snake by themselves.
This is what I say that you become your own

202
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,070
guru and you follow your own understanding
with the light of the Spirit within you, which

203
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:41,070
is your own. But this enlightened attention
works, it acts. You can close your eyes and

204
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,130
find out about anyone what's the matter with
that person. And if you know how to cure that

205
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,730
person it can work out. You do not know how
this Divine power works. This, all pervading

206
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,570
Divine power is the most efficient government,
the most efficient, we can call the housewife,

207
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:08,570
the most efficient father, mother everything.
Anything that you need is done so beautifully

208
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,760
that you are amazed and so many miracles happened
that you are amazed, how, what have I done,

209
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,770
why am I so much blessed.

210
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,520
I had asked people to write about their miracles
because they used to write letters after letters

211
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,289
and I've no time to write so I said you write
to somebody about the miracles and let him

212
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:31,240
take out a book. Now the pile has gone this
way and this way and it lost in that pile.

213
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,320
He said Mother what am I to do, is such a
lot. So we have to know that we are special

214
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:44,320
people. Human beings are at the epitome of
the evolution and that a little more is going

215
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:54,030
to give you the meaning of what you are. So
this enlightened attention makes you aware

216
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:01,350
of your powers also by which you can give
Realizations to others. You can correct them,

217
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,590
you can cure them, and you can give them peace
and joy as you have the joy.

218
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,210
Now you see these people they are mostly Canadians
here or Americans. Now to teach one sentence

219
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:21,210
of English is very easy and to teach the whole
of English also is easier but to teach one

220
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:28,650
word of Sanskrit is so difficult to an English
man. They ruled us for three hundred years

221
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,870
and we tried our level best to teach them
some English and whenever they would come

222
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,809
up and speak something we would say what language
are they speaking. We couldn't understand

223
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:43,809
the language. So it so very difficult to pronounce
this Sanskrit as well as the Indian languages.

224
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,950
But the way these people sing, I mean in India
people can't understand how they have picked

225
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,080
up this difficult language, this difficult
music, this difficult rhythm. How they have

226
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,130
done it and they sing, if you hear from outside,
you won't believe that they are Canadians

227
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,580
were singing. You think they are just some
Indians some very good singers from India

228
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,740
singing. How have they got it?

229
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,960
It is because of the new dynamism they have
developed in their creativity and we have

230
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,960
so many artists and musicians who have really,
as you say touch the roof, they have hit the

231
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,630
roof, like in their fame, in their success,
in their creativity. So you become extremely

232
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,980
creative but you become very humble. You are
not egotistical, you do not force your things

233
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,520
on to others, but automatically because you
are so good that you shine. There are so many

234
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,950
artists especially in India musicians who
have achieved great heights with Sahaja Yoga.

235
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,500
And it has to work out everywhere that we
should understand the essence of music and

236
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,500
how it really soothes human beings by which
you will, not for success but it is just for

237
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,370
expression, work out but automatically it
becomes successful. Now this is not only that

238
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,520
I'm trying to lure you to some ideas. But
what I am trying to tell you within you lies

239
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,520
all these powers and if you have not utilize
and if you have not make use of that and then

240
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:28,909
you are unhappy no body can help it. It is
all there which you have to have.

241
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:35,909
Now the Spirit gives you the knowledge of
truth. Spirit gives your attention the light

242
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,220
and Spirit is the source of joy, as if you
were getting drown in the waves of your thoughts

243
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:57,190
and worries and problems. Suddenly you find
you are in a boat and you are enjoying everything.

244
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,770
You are seeing it. When you see your problem
you can solve it better and there is the Divine

245
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:09,770
power to solve all the problems that you have,
then you learn how to swim. You can jump into

246
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,760
the same waves, which have bothered you and
save other people and so a new dynamic personality

247
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,830
you develop because you become collectively
conscious about which Jung has written that

248
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,400
now human beings will become collectively
conscious. It is the consciousness, which

249
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:39,240
is expressed in our central nervous system
by which you can feel the other.

250
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,299
Now my hand, this hand if it is hurt the another
hand can feel it, the whole body will feels

251
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:51,299
it and tries to help. Now who is the other
when everybody is a part and parcel of the

252
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,950
whole, who is the other? For example, we were
going to have a program here and you will

253
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,140
be amazed we have people even from Austria
who just came, they had holidays so they just

254
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,480
came running to help the Canadian people here
that they are very few. So better run down

255
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,480
and help them. We have people all over the
world. Sahaja Yoga is working in forty countries.

256
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:22,679
And when I went to Russia it is so gratifying
to know that the first people who came to

257
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:29,679
Russia to help the Russians were twenty five
Germans. And the Germans were so gentle, so

258
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,320
beautiful you won't believe that their fore
fathers fought with that horrible fellow Hitler.

259
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:44,320
No, they are so gentle, so beautiful and when
I saw them working on these Russians with

260
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:52,429
such love, with such attention, with such
understanding. I felt that it's another world

261
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,549
they're existing, which is so beautiful and
so nice.

262
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:04,549
In one program I don't know how much I can
tell you about it and we have here a proper

263
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:11,130
Ashram where you can go. We have here people
who have their programs where you can go.

264
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,320
But their complaints are that Mother when
You come, I don't know what happens they come

265
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,510
to Your program all right but after that they
never come and they get lost. I just don't

266
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,510
know why is it so because you just what I
can do today is like a sprouting of the seed

267
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,429
but after that you have to grow into a tree.
Unless and until you grow into the tree it's

268
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:39,830
a myth as in your Parable of Christ some fell
on the rocky areas. Some fell in the marshy

269
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:46,830
areas like that. It should not be. It should
be it fell into areas where people prospered

270
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:54,610
and became great trees. Let Canada take over.
I think Americans I'm quite disappointed.

271
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,260
I don't know what's wrong with them. They
only like falsehood.

272
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,100
All the false gurus are prospering there.
All kinds of false things they like. A lady

273
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,630
is there. She is been into lesbianism, put
some sort of a drama and they are all attracted

274
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:15,500
towards her, can't understand how can lesbianism
anything to do with Kundalini. Kundalini doesn't

275
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,480
understand these things. No where in the ancient
books written like this about Kundalini. But

276
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,330
this lady is out of the blue has started using
all these ticks and there are so many running

277
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:32,190
after her, paying her money. She has built
up big, huge amount of properties and things

278
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,740
like that, and this is not the way to do it.
Why, when I say I don't take money they will

279
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,010
immediately ask Me then what about who pays
for your travel? Mostly My husband pays, no

280
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:49,179
doubt, he has been paying. Well, you don't
want Me to pay for your salvation, like if

281
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:53,789
I go to Russia they pay for My travel. The
government pays for Me, but otherwise wherever

282
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,020
I go I have to pay for Myself, most of the
time. But even then they come to this that

283
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,149
even when you eat your food who pays for that?
It is like this. So where they have to criticize

284
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:08,500
they do not. Where they don't have to criticize
they criticize.

285
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,149
And head along, thousands have gone to this
TM business. Now this TM is another horrible

286
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:19,289
thing that has killed so many people has made
them recluses. I have got so many patients

287
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:24,820
from there who are suffering from all kinds
of troubles. But people go head along to such

288
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:31,770
things which has money you have to pay such
a lot they don't mind. As I belong to another

289
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,710
life also, you must be knowing. Ah! In that
life, I find I just keep quiet listening to

290
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,140
people. They say, "Oh! That guru is good but
you know he is very expensive but he is quite

291
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,440
good. He is expensive."

292
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,440
So, a sort of a guru shopping is going on.
We should not be stupid in life. Stupidity

293
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,919
never pays, never pays. We have to be alert.
God has given us brains to understand and

294
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,460
we should not waste our precious lives this
human life, like this. I have to just tell

295
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:15,460
you that I feel sometimes so unhappy even
when I went to Russia and Eastern block I

296
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:22,260
saw so many people getting Realization and
working it out, thousands of them. We don't

297
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,220
know how to manage. The government is giving
us all the help, everything still we don't

298
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,070
know how to put them up, in a big, say in
a stadium, always we have programs. So how

299
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:38,679
to manage all that big group and how to create
people who will go and work it out. It's such

300
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,390
a problem for us.

301
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:47,309
But in the West I find people have no value
for that, no value at all. It's such a beautiful

302
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:53,190
life, just awaiting at your door but we have
no value, no value, waste it on useless things.

303
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,549
I have to tell you as a Mother that please
be concerned about it. What's happening to

304
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:04,059
our children? What's happening to our families,
what's happening to our nation? This Ecological

305
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:10,809
problem, all these can be solved in no time
once you reach that state and we have to have

306
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:15,269
more people to reach that state and to get
to it.

307
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:19,539
So May God bless you, in this short time whatever
was possible I have told you. I would like

308
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:24,029
to also have some questions from you but the
questions should be relevant. I have not come

309
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:29,579
here to take any money. I have not come here
to take anything from you. I am not asking

310
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,319
for votes. I am not a politician. I have come
here to give you what you have. This is your

311
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:39,690
own. This is your own property, which I have
come to give you, to tell you about it. So

312
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,349
it should be relevant and sensible and I would
like to answer your questions and then we

313
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,989
can have the session of Realization, which
will take hardly ten minutes. So please have

314
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:56,399
patience with yourself. I have lot of patience
but you must have patience and just ask Me

315
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,399
questions which are sensible, not aggressive.
Thank you very much.

316
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:12,479
Questions and answers - (Questions can not
be heard but Shri Mataji is answering to a

317
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,940
question.)

318
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,420
Ah! There is nothing to be done, just now.
It will be all awakened just now. After that,

319
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:31,420
once the Kundalini is awakened you have to
see where you are lacking in, what centers

320
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:39,039
are not all right, which you will yourself
know. You have to come to our programs that

321
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,519
they have here and you have to see for yourself
what's wrong with you and you should correct

322
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:06,299
yourself. Then gradually you become the master.
To give an analogy I'll tell you like this,

323
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:20,029
first you get into the car to learn driving,
all right, so there is an accelerator and

324
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:27,029
also there is a brake. So first you start
accelerator, break both and you go I mean

325
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:37,099
in every way wrong and then gradually you
start improving on it. And when you improve

326
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,640
on it you find it suddenly that you have become
a driver. Now you can drive. You can balance

327
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,079
both the things left and right side but still
you are a driver. So there is the master sitting

328
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,119
behind. Now that master is telling you do
this, go there, here there. Suddenly while

329
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:59,119
doing all that you become the master and when
you become the master you see within yourself

330
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,450
the driver, the brake and the accelerator
and you know how to handle the whole situation.

331
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:10,539
It's like this. So it is a gradual development
within you, which you do it and you have to

332
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:17,539
come to our center, carefully and pay some
time, that's all. You have to give some time.

333
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:24,499
Time is very important. But is the most important
because you have to now use it for your inner

334
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:24,839
development.

335
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,839
We have watches in the hand. All the time
watching one minute, two minutes, three minutes

336
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:38,839
and what do we do with it? Where do we spend
the time? Either may be in the pub or in the

337
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:45,839
ball or maligning somebody or doing all kinds
of nonsensical, destructive things. But, if

338
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:54,549
we have watches, it is for what? It is for
us to save time for meditation. But meditation

339
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:03,089
is needed only about five-seven minutes in
the morning and ten minutes in the evening,

340
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:10,329
not much time. But you must come to the collective,
because it's a happening in the collective.

341
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:17,359
Like, supposing My nail is broken and I take
it out, then the body doesn't look after it.

342
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:27,670
So, there is where people do not understand
and they do not come back and then they get

343
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,999
lost.

344
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:34,999
Next program I come in, they said, "Mother
you cured me. All right, of this thing I was

345
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,719
cured, but now I have got this problem."

346
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:47,719
So, all My life I'm curing them and all My
time is wasted like that. So best thing is

347
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:55,259
that you become the doctor; you become everything.
Why don't you become? You all can become that;

348
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,640
you all have that power. So you get it. So
you don't have to do anything just now. You

349
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:12,509
all have to ... I'll just tell you how we
are going to nourish our centers and we are

350
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:21,839
going to get our Realization. I am very happy
to know that you are anxious to do something

351
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,650
about it.

352
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,239
May God bless you!

353
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,479
Nice to see such people!

354
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:37,479
Question: For somebody who is not here and
who is really sick, can You help them?

355
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:46,809
Shri Mataji: I can, but main thing is, you
see, that such a person you can help him.

356
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:54,279
First of all, you get all right. You know
all about it and then you can go and help

357
00:39:55,779 --> 00:40:00,140
that person, because the best thing is that
your knowledge will improve as you help that

358
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,940
person, gradually. It's very practical, and
it all helps. All right?

359
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,940
Question: You talk about our habits and weakness
and how to overcome that. Can You talk a little

360
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,119
bit more about it?

361
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:21,119
Shri Mataji: See, we are weak because we are
ignorant first of all. As I told you, we are

362
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:27,849
holding the snake and there's darkness and
in that darkness we don't see that this is

363
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:34,849
going to bite us. But, when you become enlightened,
you become a very powerful, dynamic person,

364
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:08,569
absolutely. And you separate yourself from
your habits. You see it very clearly. Then

365
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:15,239
you don't talk that "I have this habit or
that habit." You don't say like that.

366
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:22,239
Like a person would come and say, "Mother,
you know, my Agnya is catching; this chakra

367
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,670
is catching. That means I have too much ego."

368
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:33,670
But they don't say, "I have ego." I mean if
you tell somebody, "You have ego," they'll

369
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,680
hit you hard, isn't it? But if a person gets
it, he feels it. And he says, "Mother, I have

370
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,849
too much problem with the Agnya Chakra so
please clear it up."

371
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:51,190
So, if you have any habits - say supposing
there are people who used to take drugs. In

372
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:58,190
the beginning I had horrible people in England,
about seven of them, all drug addicts and

373
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:06,009
things. Of course, very well-educated, professors
and things, but all drug addicts, hippies

374
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:14,339
and violent people, really. When they came
to Me, it was not easy to handle them. But

375
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,920
they are today the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.
Wonderful people they are. Now what happened,

376
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:31,609
they said, "We want to get rid of it but we
can't. We just can't help it."

377
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:40,609
But you will be amazed, overnight they gave
up, overnight. Just it happens because you

378
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:45,660
see the light and you throw the snake, just
happens. You don't have to think about it,

379
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:52,660
just happens. I never tell them these Ten
Commandments - don't do this, don't do that.

380
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:09,279
Don't tell them. Just it works from within.
Why should I tell them? Why should I give

381
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:27,019
them a lecture? There's no need. They themselves
become their own master and the mastery is

382
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:31,880
that the master cures and gives you powers.
You develop that dignity; it's remarkable

383
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,109
what happens. To Me, it's not a surprise because
I know what you are. You are so glorious.

384
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:38,880
It's like you take a small little, say a television
to a remote corner of India and in some village

385
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,390
and show them and say that "Here is a place,
this box will show you all the kinds of music

386
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,539
and all kinds of dramas and this."

387
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,579
They say, "What? This box? How is it going
to work out?"

388
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:55,390
And, you put it to the mains and it starts
working and they say, "It's fantastic."

389
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,069
It's like that. We are fantastic, we are glorious
but we have yet to be connected, that's all.

390
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:05,940
It just happens, you don't have to force yourself,
you don't have to do anything. It just works.

391
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,150
The inner force works it out.

392
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,890
Anything else?

393
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:13,989
Such nice people have come today, I am very
happy. They are asking such nice questions.

394
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:14,239
[Applause]

395
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,380
Really, wonderful! But you must promise that
you all will prosper in a proper way and work

396
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:23,140
it out because it's a waste then I feel. You
know I was so enamored by the Russians and

397
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,739
the Eastern Bloc people because not that they
only come to My lecture, not that they only

398
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:34,739
listen to Me, but they work it out. And they
are moving everywhere. Now people have moved

399
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:45,170
to Siberia and all these far-fetched places.
They have taken the whole map. They brought

400
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:55,569
the whole map before Me and said, "Mother,
now tell us where should we go."

401
00:44:55,569 --> 00:45:01,099
They have gone all out. So must understand
the importance of it. It's not just like going

402
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:07,410
to one lecture or to another lecture. This
is one thing you have to promise in your heart

403
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:14,410
that "Mother, we'll all become great trees."
You have such great trees here. God has created

404
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:22,029
such beautiful thing here. Why not in Canada
we should have some great personalities, great

405
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,199
saints? Now, any other question?

406
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:32,199
Question: In order to develop realization,
if you're not living somewhere close to where

407
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:35,619
there is a center then what do we do?

408
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:42,619
Shri Mataji: There's no need to depend on
Me. We have people here who are experts, who

409
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,039
have really become masters. And, they will
definitely help you so it doesn't matter.

410
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,469
I am always with you. Whenever you think of
Me, you'll know I am with you and you can

411
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:58,849
always write to Me. There's nothing to feel
that I'm away from you, that ... maybe that

412
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:04,569
is the reason people don't go further with
it. But as you trust Me, you trust yourself.

413
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:09,150
You must trust yourself. You must have faith
in yourself that you are quite capable and

414
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:16,029
you can do it. You can do it and that there
are people who will help you. They are very

415
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:22,349
humble, sweet, beautiful people. You will
like them and they'll all help you till you

416
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,150
become perfect. Such love, I tell you.

417
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,069
Same thing [someone interrupts]. Children?
Children are the best, children are the best

418
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:33,259
for Sahaja Yoga. They take to Sahaja Yoga
in no time. Most of the children these days

419
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:40,259
are born realized and we have to just understand
them. So many children are born realized.

420
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:48,269
Children are the best to understand Sahaja
Yoga, to work it out and they just of a very

421
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:57,569
high level, I should say. Like the other day
there was a child who was receiving a phone.

422
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:14,140
He said, "Oh, it's all right. You are not
a yogi." Puts it down the phone.

423
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:53,529
So I said, "How do you know?"

424
00:47:53,749 --> 00:48:00,749
"Mother, he had no vibrations. How could I
know? Why should I talk to him? Let it be,

425
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,920
I put down the phone."

426
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,890
Question: Mother, is it a symbol of Your photograph
that gives vibrations? The willpower [can't

427
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,349
understand the rest of the question]

428
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:17,449
Shri Mataji: It's true. My photograph luckily
has some sort of a coefficience that it emits

429
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:23,759
vibrations. I mean, I would like anybody else's
photograph if it does, because it's a good

430
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:28,329
idea; but I don't think there's anyone like
that, because none of the incarnations and

431
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:32,249
none of the saints were photographed. It's
very surprising, nobody was photographed.

432
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:38,309
At the most, and also, nobody was portrayed
in their lifetime, because you know what happened

433
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:41,329
to all the saints and to all the incarnations:
when they lived, everybody was after their

434
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,609
lives. No question of having so many people.
I mean, even Christ had hardly twelve people

435
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:51,609
and how they tortured His life! Actually,
if you see His public life, He lived hardly

436
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:57,119
for three and a half years and they crucified
Him.

437
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,119
So, this is what the world was. It's not so
bad now. I mean, nobody is going to crucify

438
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:13,910
Me, but still there were no photographs. So,
the modern times has another advantage that

439
00:49:13,989 --> 00:49:20,059
they have photographs, and they will show
you lots of beautiful photographs and things

440
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:27,059
which will stun you. But that will be later
on, you can see. But even this is such an

441
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:34,459
advantage that I can talk to so many people.
And aeroplane is such an advantage that I

442
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:41,479
can travel all over the world. Everything
is such an advantage today. The communication

443
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,449
have improved so much that I could come to
Canada. Can you imagine Christ coming to Canada?

444
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:12,699
[Laughter]

445
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,609
So, I mean, see the whole advantage is there
and in Russia I have given realization to

446
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,619
people on television, on television. But they
are extremely sensitive people, extremely

447
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:26,809
sensitive. I mean, in the program when we
had the scientists, one of the scientist got

448
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:33,809
up and said, "But Mother, please tell us how
You cure people when they only attend Your

449
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:36,489
program when they are so many."

450
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:40,109
I said, "I don't know if I've cure people."

451
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:46,569
But they are so sensitive. Their spirituality
is just there. It touches so fast. We can

452
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:50,119
say that they are very, very ultra-modern
sensitive instruments. Just touch them and

453
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,849
it works. It's rather surprising. Their attention
is so good. Their attention is so good. So,

454
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,849
that's what it is, it works. But if they can
get it, you can get it. You can do it. But

455
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:07,779
also, another problem in the West is that
we are very guilty people. For nothing at

456
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:13,900
all, we are extremely - one side we are destroying
ourselves, that's one way and another is all

457
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:19,979
the time we feel, 'I've done this wrong. I've
done that wrong. Sorry, Sorry!' English language

458
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:20,559
is full of it.

459
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,859
So, we all the time start feeling sorry. There's
no need to feel all that guilt and sin and

460
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:30,049
all this nonsensical ideas. That really spoils
the game for Me also. I have seen Americans

461
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:37,049
are the worst. They are guilty for this and
guilty for that. What is there to be guilty?

462
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:51,219
After all, you are human beings and if you
have done any mistakes, doesn't matter. After

463
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:58,749
all you're not Gods. So what? If you have
done mistakes, all right forget it. Forget

464
00:51:58,749 --> 00:51:59,539
the past.

465
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:04,680
But this is also another problem of the West
is: now their forefathers say came here and

466
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,499
killed some Red Indians. Now, the forefathers
are finished, they might have become Red Indians

467
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:13,479
in this lifetime. They are not there. You
are their children's children's children's

468
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:19,199
children. Now why are you carrying on the
jokes so far? But for everything they feel

469
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,849
guilty - is another such a mental nonsense
that please, before I start this program,

470
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:29,769
I have to request you that don't feel guilty
for anything. You have done nothing wrong.

471
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:33,509
[Shri Mataji speaks aside] Also, there is
another two-three people.

472
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:39,549
Question: Is Gorbachev is a walk-in, which
means that is he from some other place which

473
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:40,509
is advanced soul?

474
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:46,279
Shri Mataji: He is a realized soul, no doubt,
he is. That's why it's working out. He knows

475
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:51,489
Me very well. He is a realized soul. That
you recognized him, I'm very happy to know

476
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:57,589
that. He is and look at them, how lucky they
are to have him there. And, he is a very sensible

477
00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:02,209
man, no doubt. Even Lenin was. Lenin was a
realized soul, you will be surprised, but

478
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:08,869
he was forced by all his party members. He
was alone, you see. And, all of them forced

479
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:15,869
him to take a course of line which was really
proved later on. But whatever was his state,

480
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:31,479
talked about stateless state and all that
was his dream and that's coming true. He was

481
00:53:41,729 --> 00:53:48,729
also a realized soul. But he went onto a wrong
line and it took so much time for them to

482
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:54,199
come back and they had horrible despotic people,
no doubt but the way the Gorbachev is doing

483
00:53:54,199 --> 00:54:01,199
is great and I have a rapport with him and
he is a very great man, I must say. And he

484
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,920
has tremendous respect for Me. Because we
are of the same style, you can say, the same

485
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,049
line, that's why.

486
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:16,459
You, too, had in America. You had, say, Abraham
Lincoln was a realized soul, no doubt. And,

487
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:21,489
we had Mahatma Gandhi. We had many people,
but they were singled out. They couldn't give

488
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:26,019
realizations to others. They were singled
out and they had to fight, but now you all

489
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:31,469
can become realized souls. We have to have
many more to get peace, to get joy, to get

490
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,150
what we deserve.

491
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,170
[Question: A lady seems to have some illness
that doctors can't diagnose and is asking

492
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,819
if Shri Mataji can help.]

493
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:43,109
Shri Mataji: Yes, that's true. I am Myself
a doctor. I've done medicine, Myself. I know

494
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:47,739
that. It's difficult for them because they
cannot raise the Kundalini. You see that's

495
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:50,479
the problem is. Please sit down, I'll tell
you.

496
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:55,439
The medical science is, of course has reached
a quite a lot of height and have understood

497
00:54:55,439 --> 00:55:02,420
anything, but the problem with the medical
line is this: that when a tree is sick, you

498
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,819
see, we treat the leaves but we cannot get
to the roots, you see. But Sahaja Yoga is

499
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:14,819
a thing that gets to the roots, and I'm not
telling you off-hand, you see, there are three

500
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,609
doctors who got their Ph.D. in India in Sahaja
Yoga that they have cured people. There are

501
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:29,410
seven doctors in London who are now writing
down about how many people have been cured

502
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,630
with Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:36,059
But the problem is like this: like for in
America, I cannot cure people because I will

504
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:41,249
be arrested. If and if Christ goes there,
He will be arrested. The medical science doesn't

505
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:45,140
allow there, I mean, that anybody should cure
anyone. Now, the problem is if you come to

506
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:52,140
India nobody is allowed to come to India who
suffers with AIDS and all such diseases. Big

507
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:57,089
problem for the patient also. Even in England,
you see, if we cannot say that we can cure

508
00:55:57,089 --> 00:56:00,890
them, lots of problems with the law. And,
we cannot. But only thing those who get cured

509
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:06,279
automatically, like we have the people who
are Sahaja Yogis who had diseases, they have

510
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:13,279
got their papers, everything, and then they
are cured, then we note it down. India is

511
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:21,009
the only place where I can start this curing
business. But to be very frank, we are not

512
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:26,339
in this business. We are not in the business
of curing. What we are doing is to raise your

513
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:33,130
Kundalini by which you get cured as a by-product.
We are not doing curing. That's not our job.

514
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,229
That's not what we do.

515
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:42,140
And, also I must tell you the Divinity has
common sense. A common sense in the sense

516
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:48,529
that: now these lights are here, we know that
particular bulb is not going to work. So nobody

517
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:54,529
wants to cure. The Divine doesn't want to
cure people who are not going to give lights,

518
00:56:54,529 --> 00:56:58,019
who are not going to get to Sahaja Yoga, means
that their Kundalini doesn't rise. If their

519
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:01,559
Kundalini doesn't rise, then how can we cure?
That's the only way we can cure people.

520
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,359
So there are limitations also that your Kundalini
has to rise and then you can get cured. But

521
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,839
there are many miracles which have happened.
I don't know how people got cured. And there

522
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,900
have been many cures, no doubt. And, it sounds
very, very much fantastic that it can be cured

523
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,439
through Kundalini awakening but it has happened.
We have to accept the truth. As long as it

524
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:22,469
helps, what does it matter?

525
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:22,989
Yes, please?

526
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:27,069
Question: What would be the effect of increasing
number of Sahaja Yogis on the economic system

527
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:33,219
and the lifestyle of the country where the
increase of Sahaja Yogis takes place?

528
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:39,189
Shri Mataji: Oh, it just triggers everything.
For example, now what are our problems? We

529
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:46,189
see the economic problems of this country
is. I have understood it so well that we have

530
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:56,709
so much of a, say, ores and all other things
like silver we have here, and gold and all

531
00:57:56,709 --> 00:58:03,359
kinds of things we have, and the ones who
are exploiting us are Americans and nobody

532
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,369
sees the point. Nobody sees the point. While
those who will get Sahaja Yogis, they will

533
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:14,369
become so dynamic. They will put in their
own industries here. Why send it? Why make

534
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:22,619
cars in America? Why not make them here? So
many things can happen because you become

535
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,989
so dynamic and there's so many people to help
you all over that this is what should happen.

536
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:36,019
After all, you have all kinds of things available
here. Why should you send your aluminum to

537
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:42,049
America, to be drawn into wires and beaten
into sheets? There's no need. We can do it

538
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:42,410
ourselves.

539
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:46,959
So this, you see, self-confidence that we
can do it together and the collective feeling

540
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:53,479
can give you such good ideas. And another
point is that the way we are working out machines

541
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:58,380
now. Now we have to understand that machines
are for us. We have created machines and machines

542
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:05,380
are to be used according to our need and we
are not for machines. They are not to dominate

543
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:14,809
us. So as much as we need we'll use machines
otherwise we'll not use machines. And as a

544
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:23,019
result, already it is happening that people
don't like machine-made things and machine-made

545
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:27,219
this thing. So they will go to the balancing
state where they will take to more handmade

546
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:34,069
things and handmade material. Now for a handmade
things you don't have to have so many. Like,

547
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:40,469
now we say in India, thank God, we are quite
poor country, we can't afford to have so many

548
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:45,859
machines. Thank God for that because now in
a household they will have about, say, ten

549
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:51,579
plates of brass or twelve plates of brass.
Finished. We don't have to have so many crockery,

550
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:58,579
cutlery, this, that, that breaks. Then, after
that you have plastic. Because it breaks so

551
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:06,670
you have plastics. So, you go on. The plastic
is now mounting up, mountains after mountains

552
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:12,969
we have created.

553
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:16,519
So, you take more to practical side, very
much practical and more to the natural. And

554
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:20,630
in natural, it's nice to have one natural
thing than to have ten plastics. Now people

555
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:25,589
are realizing, I'm not saying they are not
realizing it. But still there are machines

556
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:31,109
sitting on top of us. And then the entrepreneurs,
the entrepreneurs are very clever. Today they

557
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:35,449
start one fashions, tomorrow another fashion,
third day third fashion. England is another

558
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:40,650
one who suffers a lot. For example, in a place
like London, which is such a cold place, people

559
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:46,900
have pants which have holes in it. They call
it holy pants, you see. And now imagine, they

560
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:52,209
developed varicose veins with that. Or they'll
have tight pants. They have to do something

561
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:57,349
about it. They have to feed their machines.
So they will start this fashion or that fashion.

562
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:02,449
Now, there's another fashion which is also
very dangerous that people don't put any oil

563
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:08,229
in their hair. Before taking a head bath,
one can put easily some oil or before night

564
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:13,079
they can put it. They are all getting bald.
Once they get bald, them they'll sell their

565
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,289
wigs. The same hair which are fallen off,
they make wigs and sell it. They are befooling

566
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:22,650
you. If you see little bit, you stand out
and see how they are befooling you must, these

567
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:27,489
entrepreneurs are. This is the fashion today,
that is the fashion.

568
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:33,489
I was seeing the children, we are now producing
clothes for children, for example. The clothes

569
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,559
are such horrible clothes. I mean, they call
them...

570
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,369
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi, "What
do they call such clothes now-a-days?"]

571
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:45,910
... trendy, trendy clothes. Children wear
trendy clothes. They have no respect, respect

572
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:51,199
for themselves. They don't respect themselves.
If you give them trendy clothes, you see,

573
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:58,199
they become like brats, and then you say they
are brats. You make them brats from very childhood.

574
01:02:01,539 --> 01:02:08,539
You want them to be brats, you see. So,the
whole system changes. Children become so beautiful,

575
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,119
so dignified.

576
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:22,119
Dress makes a person understand what is his
personality is, isn't it? If you are just

577
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:35,769
sort of careless about everything, you are
not bothered and the way - I have seen also

578
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:42,919
children and even the grown-ups walk as if
you see the, it doesn't matter how you walk,

579
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:50,589
you throw your legs this side, hands like
that. That shows the personality, that this

580
01:02:53,679 --> 01:03:00,679
personality has no sense of dignity - how
it has to walk, how they have to talk or things.

581
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:05,239
So the whole thing has come down.

582
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:12,239
Now, for example, English language now. I
never studied English language but when I

583
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:20,919
went to England, I was surprised the kind
of English they are speaking. I mean, you

584
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:29,079
don't know what sort of English they are speaking.
And, really is impossible. At least, in Canada

585
01:03:29,259 --> 01:03:36,259
people speak better English, I tell you.

586
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:46,939
You'll have a language problem, really. Because
they, even people from Cambridge, they have

587
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:03,499
developed such funny, funny intonations and
funny pronunciation that it's impossible to

588
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:05,999
cope with them.

589
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:12,109
So this is what I'm trying to tell you: that
once you get this balance, once you get this

590
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:16,679
knowledge, you develop a balanced economy,
you develop a balanced ecology, you develop

591
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:20,650
everything in balance because all these imbalances
has come through human beings. What is the

592
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:25,799
source is a human being. You see, in the jungle
if you go there's no imbalance. Only where

593
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:31,209
human beings live there's imbalance. So once
you get into balance, when you have more Sahaja

594
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:37,919
Yogis, there will be more balance and you'll
be surprised how things will work out. And,

595
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:42,819
above all there is this Divine Power which
is going to help you.

596
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:45,400
Now, what do you want again?

597
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,549
Question: Can we meditate now?

598
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:53,679
Now, I hope you are finished with your questions,
because if you finish with questions it's

599
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,910
better because this mind, you know, is a funny
thing. Suddenly, you're meditating, suddenly

600
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:03,049
a thing will come, "Oh, I should have asked
this question to Mother!" But as she says

601
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:09,479
it's true that even if I answer all your questions,
it's a mental acrobat. I can answer all your

602
01:05:09,479 --> 01:05:16,479
questions very well. I am good at it, but
it is not going to raise your Kundalini. So

603
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:24,999
no question, is better that you just see that
what happens because it's a happening within

604
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:30,339
yourself. It takes you without thinking about
it. It takes you beyond the state where you

605
01:05:30,339 --> 01:05:35,489
become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware
but the thoughts absolutely subside. And then

606
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:42,489
ultimately you feel a cool breeze coming out
of your head and you feel cool breeze all

607
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:52,900
around you. This is what has to happen. And
I'm very happy that she has pointed out that

608
01:05:57,169 --> 01:06:03,349
they are all waiting for it. And, there's
no end to these talks and things.

609
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:08,969
So, if you have any questions you may write
to Me or you may give Me in writing, if you

610
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:14,239
feel that it is such an important question.
Then, of course, these people will definitely

611
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:18,689
try to give you an answer for that.

612
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:25,689
Now, I have I think in thousands My lectures
are there and the tapes are available. But

613
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:32,869
we do not give people the lectures and the
books and things because once it starts the

614
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:39,009
mental activity they just run into that. So,
first of all develop yourself internally into

615
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:45,749
that abstract stage and then if you read,
it has some meaning. Otherwise, there are

616
01:06:45,749 --> 01:06:52,199
people who know everything about Sahaja Yoga
but they can't do anything about it.

617
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:58,819
Still there are two persons. Now these are
the last two persons, all right? Now, what's

618
01:06:58,819 --> 01:06:59,589
it madam?

619
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:04,349
Question: When do you feel the throbbing feeling
when the Kundalini rises, when pulsation is

620
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:04,880
there?

621
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:11,880
You see, actually, Kundalini is in this jet
age has become like a jet Kundalini. She just

622
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:19,539
rises, She doesn't give you much throbbing
or anything - normally, normally I'm saying.

623
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:25,049
But if you have some troubles, some diseases,
something, some obstructions, then it does

624
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:31,939
throb a little. But you can feel it nicely
on your head the cool breeze coming out of

625
01:07:31,939 --> 01:07:38,880
your fontanel bone area, very nicely, you
see it, you feel it. So it is the throbbing

626
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,880
of the Kundalini and all that are just like
some sort of an obstructions or say, short

627
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:54,839
circuiting but that can be corrected very
easily. So, it's like a very nicely built,

628
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:59,299
very efficiently built aeroplane, has a very
smooth landing, like that Kundalini rises

629
01:07:59,299 --> 01:08:03,759
very beautifully. And, this is the blessing
of the modern times, I think, that the Kundalini

630
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,509
works out that way.

631
01:08:05,509 --> 01:08:07,699
There's one more, there was one gentleman.

632
01:08:07,699 --> 01:08:13,039
Question: The question is that once the Kundalini
is awaken he's read that Kundalini can be

633
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,580
if uncontrolled, if you don't know how to
control it, can it harm you?

634
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:22,659
You see, these books are written by people
who have no idea of Kundalini. It's not like

635
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:28,139
that. You see, this is just to sell something.
It's marketing. Sell anything, any nonsense,

636
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:33,779
there's nothing. She is your Mother. She is
your individual Mother who's waiting to give

637
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:39,799
you your second birth. Why will She trouble
you? When you got your birth, your mother

638
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:44,869
looked after everything, she, poor thing,
went through all the labor pains and everything,

639
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:49,659
she didn't allow you to suffer anything, she
never wanted you to suffer. Did she? Then

640
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:56,449
this is a pure Mother, your own individual
Mother; She knows each and everything about

641
01:08:56,449 --> 01:09:03,230
you. It's all recorded in Her and She is not
going to trouble you, and you are going to

642
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:10,230
be controlled by Her in such a manner that
She becomes your energy. She helps you. So,

643
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:18,039
all these false ideas people have given, written
books after books so that they can sell it.

644
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:23,559
I haven't written any books so far. You'll
be surprised, I've not written any books so

645
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,079
far. Twenty years have past, I've written
no books whatsoever. People have written about

646
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,839
Me, people have written about Sahaja Yoga,
they have written all this, but I have not

647
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:38,839
yet written. I'll be writing. I hope so I
get some time to write. But you see, what

648
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:57,770
is important is that whatever written can
be all nonsense. They can write anything about

649
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:04,770
anything. First of all, you should know what
it is. And now I have been going to various

650
01:10:05,639 --> 01:10:10,630
places, I have not seen it misbehaving anywhere
or doing any harm to anybody. Of course, sometimes

651
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:17,630
you do feel little heat in the body, that's
all. That's the thing you feel little heat

652
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:32,369
on your hands, that's all. But it's so little
that it's negligible. So, be confident.

653
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:42,199
First of all, before starting I have to tell
you few things and one of them is that have

654
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:54,469
faith in yourself. Have faith that you all
are capable of getting your Self-realization.

655
01:10:54,469 --> 01:11:01,469
Please have that faith in yourself. You have
faith in everything else but in yourself,

656
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:09,630
that's wrong. Please have faith in yourself.
That is first point.

657
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:15,510
Now there are two conditions we have to fulfill
before we get our realization. First condition

658
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:22,510
is I have already told you, that not to feel
guilty, forget the past. Not to feel guilty

659
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:30,340
is very important because when you feel guilty,
then the center here on the left side catches,

660
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:36,630
Vishuddhi as they call it, and it's the worst
thing that can happen because this is the

661
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:42,760
center when it catches you get spondylitis,
you get angina, all kinds of trouble with

662
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:49,199
this center. But the worst thing is that the
Kundalini cannot rise above this center. So,

663
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:56,199
not to feel guilty. I assure you that you
have done nothing wrong.

664
01:12:00,059 --> 01:12:06,230
You see, there are so many norms a society
has created. Even if you put the fork on the

665
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:11,800
other side you start thinking, "Oh God, what
did I do?" You feel you are not sophisticated

666
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,800
or you have done something like a murder.
It's not that. It is just all these norms

667
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:27,440
are artificially created, all these are artificial
things. Somebody is very thin, he thinks,

668
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:34,570
"Why should I be thin?" Somebody's fat, he
says, "Why should I be fat?" But this is life's,

669
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:43,800
whatever is there we have to accept our life
as it is and there's nothing wrong in it.

670
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:50,099
Nothing guilt. Whatever is there, whatever
we have been doing, we have been doing as

671
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:50,900
human beings.

672
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:57,719
So, first and foremost condition is - absolutely
you cannot compromise on that - is that you

673
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:01,820
are not to feel guilty at all. Immediately,
you'll feel better.

674
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,920
All right, the second one is that you have
to forgive everyone, forgive everyone because

675
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,260
whether you forgive or you don't forgive,
you don't do anything. You are living with

676
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:18,260
a myth, all the time thinking, "Oh, I have
to forgive this person, I have to forgive

677
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:26,520
that person." There's no need to think like
that. You don't also have to think about any

678
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:36,489
individual, just in general you have to say,
"I forgive everyone of them." And, that clears

679
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:45,039
out this center, very clearly, this is the
center of Christ, this clears out, and it's

680
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:53,440
very easy for Me because this is a very constricted,
it's the gate to the limbic area so that gate

681
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:03,500
has to be widened and it has to be opened
out. And so, just forgive everyone. And, you

682
01:14:04,789 --> 01:14:11,070
know it is a myth. You are playing into the
wrong hands. So, this is another condition,

683
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:18,070
you have to just accept. Then it's easier
for Me to work it out and easier for you to

684
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:18,510
get it.

685
01:14:18,409 --> 01:14:23,130
So, first is just don't feel guilty. If you
don't forgive, you won't feel it. Then, you

686
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:28,679
will come and say, "Mother, I didn't feel
it." And then I'll have to say, "All right,

687
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:34,469
forgive, forgive, forgive." And then you'll
feel it. So, what's the use? Just better do

688
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:41,409
what I've told you, is very simple thing,
just forgive everyone in general.

689
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:48,409
Then there are certain simple things: that
we have to take help of the Mother Earth.

690
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:56,980
Now those who are sitting in the ground are
the best placed, that's all right, they can

691
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:04,199
just take out their shoes, so they're not,
it's better that their feet are a little open

692
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:16,900
out. And, all of you should have to take your
feet out, it helps a lot.

693
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:22,960
Those who are sitting, should sit more cross-legged
it's better, better to sit cross legged. It's

694
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,679
hardly will take any time and is ... you don't
have to fight with your thoughts, you don't

695
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:32,309
have to stop your thoughts, nothing, it just
works automatically. I would say, like your

696
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:39,309
attention is like this saree. Now, the Kundalini
rises like this, goes up and She pushes all

697
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,309
your attention inside automatically and then
when it pierces through here, then the grace

698
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,820
starts falling on your attention, on your
sympathetic nervous system and it soothes

699
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:54,989
down. Then, your centers open more and more
threads of Kundalini rise. So, this is what

700
01:15:54,989 --> 01:16:01,989
is today's modern Sahaja Yoga, which somehow
or other I've managed to discover, that let

701
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:07,780
few threads of Kundalini rise to begin with
so that you open your chakras gradually, and

702
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,940
then more and more. And then one day I find
you all have become great gurus, great personalities.

703
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,110
So, may God bless you all!

704
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:18,520
So, let us now with all respect to ourselves,
with all love for ourselves, we have to have

705
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,630
complete faith in ourselves, complete faith.
Have complete self confidence. Now please

706
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:26,050
put both your hands like this. It's important
to understand that these five, six and seven

707
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,030
are the sympathetic nervous system endings
and this side also are, these are sympathetic

708
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,420
nervous system endings and they are the ones
who are expressing the centers within ourselves.

709
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:37,090
Like this, left and right meet and make one
center. So, is very important that you, we

710
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:41,079
have to put both the hands like this to begin
with.

711
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:48,079
You can, now somebody will show you how we
are going to nourish our centers. The left

712
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:56,400
side represents our desire, not the pure desire,
but our desire. And the right side represents

713
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:07,429
our action, power of action. So, we will be
using our power of action to nourish our centers,

714
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:19,280
while the left hand will be all the time towards
Myself. Before closing your eyes, you can

715
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:25,820
also take out your spectacles because this
helps eyesight also. So before, not now, just

716
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:32,820
now when I tell to, because just now I'll
show you how to do it and then we'll close

717
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,280
our eyes. So somebody will show you.

718
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,659
First of all, you put your left hand toward
Me like this. Of course, those who don't want

719
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:52,659
to do it, should go because it is proper not
to disturb others. You see, nobody should,

720
01:17:53,500 --> 01:18:00,500
those who do not want to do should try to
do it because it's not proper and should not

721
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:07,349
disturb others in between to get up and walk
out.

722
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:14,349
So, now please put your left hand towards
Me like this. And, with the right hand we

723
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:22,429
nourish our centers. So, first we put it on
our heart. In the heart, resides the Spirit,

724
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:30,099
is reflected in the Spirit. Spirit is the
reflection of God Almighty and Kundalini is

725
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:37,099
the reflection of the primordial power, His
desire which we call as Adi Shakti or we call

726
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:11,789
it as Holy Ghost. These two have to meet,
and the seat of the Spirit is on the fontanel

727
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:18,949
bone area here, seat of the Spirit is here,
but it resides in our heart.

728
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:25,949
Now, so first we put our right hand on our
heart and then we put our right hand in the

729
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:35,250
upper portion of our abdomen where is the
center of our mastery. This is created by

730
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:42,610
all the great masters like Abraham, Moses,
Lao Tse, so many of them who were real masters.

731
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:49,610
They have created this. Like Guru Nanaka,
Janaka, all these people have created this

732
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,659
great center within us.

733
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:59,659
Then we take down our hand in the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side. This

734
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:07,110
is the center of pure knowledge, pure knowledge
that is the one which gives us the awareness

735
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:15,110
on our central nervous system. It manifests
a new dimension in our awareness on our central

736
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:21,619
nervous system which is called in Sanskrit
as bodh, bodh from where the word Buddha has

737
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:28,619
come, or we can say it manifests in the word,
vidh. Vidh is from where Vedas have come.

738
01:20:29,099 --> 01:20:33,420
That you feel the divine power on your central
nervous system, you feel the truth on your

739
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:38,519
central nervous system because whatever we
have gained in our evolution, you feel it

740
01:20:38,519 --> 01:20:44,550
on our central nervous system. That is what
is "to know." Knowledge is not mental. It

741
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:50,719
is in our evolutionary process to know on
your central nervous system like hot and cold.

742
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,820
So now, this is the center which manifests
that pure knowledge.

743
01:20:54,820 --> 01:21:01,820
So, now we take our hand again upward and
put it on the center of mastery which is on

744
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:12,150
the left hand side in the upper part of our
abdomen. Then we take our hand onto our heart,

745
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:36,530
and here we know that Spirit resides here.
Then we take our hand in the corner of our

746
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:55,230
neck and our shoulder here and put it back
as far as possible and turn our head to our

747
01:21:55,230 --> 01:22:02,230
right, we turn our head to our right. This
is the center which as I have told you is

748
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:41,090
always in trouble when we feel guilty and
today also I feel it's quite a lot among the

749
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,929
people who are here.

750
01:22:44,929 --> 01:22:51,929
So, now please remember not to feel guilty
at all. Turn your head to your right and just

751
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:03,550
not to feel guilty, is very important. Now
then we put our hand across like this on our

752
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:17,969
forehead and pressing on both the temples
with our small finger and our thumb on another

753
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:31,489
side we put all the other fingers on the head
and put down our head like this. This is the

754
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:53,050
center, this is the center for forgiving others.
Forgive everyone. Now, we take back this hand

755
01:23:56,809 --> 01:24:03,809
on the back side of our head on the optic
lobe here, on the back side of our head and

756
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:15,630
push back our head as far back as possible
resting on our hand, and here is the center

757
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:30,570
without feeling guilty, without counting any
mistakes, just for your satisfaction to ask

758
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,809
for forgiveness from the divine power.

759
01:25:01,809 --> 01:25:08,809
Now, then we stretch our hand, stretch our
hand and the center of our palm, we put it

760
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:22,260
on the fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in our childhood. Now we put down your

761
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:36,440
head, put down our head and press this area
nicely by pushing our fingers outward. This

762
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:50,670
is very important thing to do is to push back
your fingers outward so there's nice pressure

763
01:25:56,989 --> 01:26:03,989
on your fontanel bone area. Now here is the
limbic area, the opening of the limbic area

764
01:26:09,739 --> 01:26:16,739
is the fontanel bone area. So now what we
do is to now slowly move our hand clockwise

765
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:28,079
pressing the scalp, move the scalp, clockwise,
seven times. Push down your head, it's better,

766
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:34,260
then you can do it better, move it seven times
clockwise.

767
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:41,260
Now, I think everything was done all right
but we didn't push back the fingers nicely

768
01:26:42,349 --> 01:26:49,349
and the pressure was less but doesn't matter.
Now, so, you have been already told what is

769
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:02,260
to be done. Now please, again see that you
put both your feet away from each other because

770
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:15,670
they are two different powers. Put your left
hand towards Me, put your right hand on your

771
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
head. No, not like that, you can sit, I mean
you can sit cross legged, cross legged is

772
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
better, it's all right, for sitting down this
cross legged is better. I am just telling

773
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
for people who are sitting on the chairs.
Just imagine people getting realization sitting

774
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
on the chairs. Is something great, isn't it?
Otherwise, we had to go to Himalayas and starve

775
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
for so many days, work so hard, stand on your
heads and still come back empty handed. You

776
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
are specially blessed to be born in this era.

777
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
All right, so now we put our left hand towards
Me, and right hand on the heart and now we

778
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
close our eyes. We don't open our eyes till
I tell you. Please keep your eyes shut till

779
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
I tell you. Now, the whole thing works like
a divine computer, so you have to ask a question.

780
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
You can call Me Mother or you can call Me
Shri Mataji, whatever you like. Now, put your

781
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
right hand on your heart and left hand towards
Me all the time. And, now sit comfortably,

782
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
not bending too much nor in a stretched manner
but in a comfortable, straight way. Here now

783
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
you ask a question three times, "Mother, am
I the Spirit?" This is the truth about you

784
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
that you are the Spirit. So now ask the question
three times in your heart, "Mother, am I the

785
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Spirit?"

786
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Now, if you are the Spirit, then you are your
master. So, now take your right hand in the

787
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
upper portion of your abdomen and ask a question,
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question

788
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
three times.

789
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Now I have to tell you that I cannot force
pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for

790
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
it. So, now please take your hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

791
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Here you have to say six times, because this
center has got six petals. So, please say,

792
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Say
this six times because I cannot force on you.

793
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
You have to ask in your freedom. I respect
it.

794
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the
Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish

795
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
the upper centers so that it's easy for Her
to rise. So, now take your right hand in the

796
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
upper portion of your abdomen on the left
hand side, press it hard. Here, you have to

797
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
say with full confidence ten times, "Mother,
I am my own master." Say it with full confidence

798
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
in yourself, ten times, "Mother, I am my own
master."

799
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Now, raise your right hand on your heart.
I have already told you that Spirit resides

800
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
in your heart, so now here you say with full
confidence, twelve times, "Mother, I am the

801
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
Spirit."

802
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
We have to know this all-pervading power which
has created us, which is nourishing us, which

803
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
is looking after us, which organizes us and
which loves us, is the ocean of knowledge

804
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
and compassion. But above all, it is the ocean
of forgiveness, and we cannot commit any mistakes

805
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
that cannot be dissolved by the power of this
ocean of forgiveness. So, now please raise

806
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
your hand in the corner of your neck and your
shoulder and push it back as far as possible

807
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
on the spinal cord and turn your head to right.
And here, with full confidence, please say

808
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at
all." Please say it sixteen times from your

809
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
heart, please say it.

810
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
I have already told you that whether you forgive
or don't forgive, you do not do anything,

811
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:25,570
it's a myth. But, if you don't forgive then
you play into wrong hands and torture yourself

812
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,639
for nothing at all. So, now please raise your
right hand on your forehead across pressing

813
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:34,639
both the temples with your small finger and
your thumb and putting all the three fingers

814
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:41,219
on top of your head. And now, put it down
your head properly, press it hard on both

815
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:48,219
the sides. And here you have to say from your
heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive

816
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:02,980
everyone." From your heart, please say, "Mother,
I forgive everyone." Please do not say that

817
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:11,449
it is difficult. It's the easiest thing to
say. Put down your head properly, press it

818
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:22,590
hard and say it from your heart.

819
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:29,590
Now, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

820
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:40,199
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine
Power. So, now take your right hand on the

821
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:49,510
back side of your head and push back your
head as far as possible, on the hand balancing.

822
01:28:53,329 --> 01:29:00,329
Now here, you have to say again from your
heart, now how many times, "Oh Divine Power,

823
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:12,730
if I have done anything wrong knowingly or
unknowingly, please forgive me." This is to

824
01:29:14,199 --> 01:29:21,199
be said for your own satisfaction. Push back
your head as much as possible.

825
01:29:25,099 --> 01:29:32,099
Now, the last center which is most important:
stretch your palm as far as possible, put

826
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:47,409
it on, put the center of your palm on top
of the fontanel bone area which was the soft

827
01:29:56,650 --> 01:30:03,650
bone in your childhood. Now put down your
head as much as you can, please put it down.

828
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:13,559
Now, stretch your fingers. Please stretch
them properly and put a nice pressure on your

829
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:21,989
fontanel bone area. Here, again I respect
your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization

830
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:30,739
on you. You have to ask for it. So, now please
move your scalp, slowly, seven times, clockwise,

831
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:41,949
saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

832
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:48,949
[Mother blows in the microphone seven times.]

833
01:31:37,429 --> 01:31:44,429
Now, please take down your hands, both the
hands, and please place them towards Me and

834
01:31:53,579 --> 01:32:00,579
gradually open your eyes. Now, watch Me without
thinking. Now, please put your left hand towards

835
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:29,760
Me. Bend your head and see for yourself if
there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

836
01:32:33,289 --> 01:32:40,289
Please see with your right hand. Some people
get it very close and some far away but don't

837
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:51,530
put your hand on top of your head. Just see
for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming

838
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,929
out of your head.

839
01:32:54,929 --> 01:33:01,929
Now, please put your right hand towards Me
and bend your head again and see for yourself

840
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:10,449
if there's a cool breeze coming out of your
head. Some people get it quite far away. Please

841
01:33:10,449 --> 01:33:17,449
put again your left hand towards Me and see
for yourself again if there's a cool breeze

842
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:26,000
coming out of your head. Now raise both your
hands towards the sky like this, push back

843
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:42,579
your head and ask a question, "Mother, is
this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or

844
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:49,039
"Mother, is this the all-pervading power of
God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

845
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:49,360
Any one of these question you ask three times.

846
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:49,980
Now, put your hands down. You feel very relaxed
and there's won't be any thoughts. You can

847
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:50,590
watch Me without thinking. All those who have
felt cool or hot breeze on their hands, on

848
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,170
their fingertips or out of their head, please
raise both your hands. That's it. May God

849
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:51,420
bless you. [Applause]

850
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:55,860
I am here only for tonight and I would like
to meet you all if you want to meet Me, I

851
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:56,110
would like to shake hands with you. Thank
you. [Applause]

852
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:00,559
[While walking towards the car] Now you have
to look after the new people, all of you have

853
01:34:00,559 --> 01:34:07,130
to look after the new people with care, with
understanding. And, best of luck to all of

854
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:14,130
you. It's a very delicate work. Whatever impression
they get from you, that is going to work out.

They must feel that "these people are very
loving and kind" and you don't disappoint

856
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:31,250
them too much. You must show your own discipline.

858
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:33,579
It's with very difficulty that we are building
up Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yogis should not

859
01:34:33,579 --> 01:34:36,179
break it at least but they can build it up
themselves such a lot. So, we have to be like

860
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:43,179
them, compete with people who have done something
for Sahaja Yoga, compete with them and not

861
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:50,940
with them who are trying to destroy Sahaja
Yoga. It's so important. One has to play one's

862
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,030
own role.
