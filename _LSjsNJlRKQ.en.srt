1
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,120
Is there somebody here who can translate?

2
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
A mature person.

3
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,200
You can sit here

4
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,680
But has he not come?

5
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,440
He should come for the puja, you know.

6
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
Everybody should come in.

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,680
When they are all here, then I will start.

8
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,440
Now, come forward. There's room here.

9
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Those who can sit on the ground can sit in front.

10
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Come. Nice!

11
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,120
You like it? Color is all right?

12
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Where is a... who else will translate?

13
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
All right, you can come.

14
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,640
You do it in French and she can do it in Italian.

15
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Arnau has ... come?

16
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,520
You are there. Who else?

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
The children can sit in front

18
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,360
- let the children sit in front.

19
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,200
All the four children could come later on,

20
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,040
when you start the puja.

21
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,680
Has everybody come?

22
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Ah! Robotic motor-cars!

23
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,160
Great!

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,160
May God bless you. Exactly, that's what it is!

25
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,920
All right. First I would like to tell you about

26
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,480
the meaning of puja.

27
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,960
There are two aspects.

28
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,080
One is the aspect

29
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,600
that you have got your own

30
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,560
deities within yourself.

31
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,240
And these deities are to be awakened within you.

32
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,920
Deities are the different aspects of one God.

33
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,680
So on one side you have the Deities,

34
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
means the aspects of God,

35
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,480
which are all the time awakened.

36
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,720
On the other side you have your own Deities,

37
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,360
which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half-awakened,

38
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,360
sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick.

39
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,240
So you have to use two methods:

40
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,720
one to please the Deities of God,

41
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,080
and to ask them to bless your Deities,

42
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,040
or to ask them to awaken your Deities.

43
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,440
So by doing the puja, means when you offer anything

44
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,520
that you have got to offer,

45
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,000
anything that you offer is - say, flowers,

46
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,240
if you want to offer flower to God,

47
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
you don't have to speak anything,

48
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,080
you have to just offer, that "this is for You."

49
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
Anybody can understand offering,

50
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,280
for that you don't have to have even a tongue.

51
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,960
Even if a blind man is there, if he wants to give you something,

52
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
he can just give you like this.

53
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,480
And that expression is sufficient

54
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,160
for anybody to be convinced that he can offer it.

55
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,680
You don't have to say anything about it.

56
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,880
So now, when you offer a flower to God,

57
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
even if you don't say a mantra

58
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,600
it is offered - all right, it's given.

59
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,680
But whether it is accepted or not is a problem.

60
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,120
But now, when you are a realized soul and you offer anything,

61
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,600
it is acceptable to God even if you don't say anything.

62
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,560
But what about you getting any reward out of it?

63
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,600
After realization when you offer anything to God, He accepts,

64
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,960
because it's coming from a realized soul, so He accepts.

65
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,280
Now, how do we get

66
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,000
blessed by Him, by giving a flower to God?

67
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
Now if you don't say anything about it,

68
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,560
you just offer a flower,

69
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,800
then you might be rewarded with many flowers

70
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,440
automatically in life.

71
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,240
Or you may be, whatever material things you offer,

72
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,080
you may be blessed materially.

73
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,760
Then in a subtler way if you say something,

74
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,680
as you say for offering somebody

75
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,560
that humble way of saying that

76
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,240
"I'll be happy if You would accept this,"

77
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,400
will be even subtler results of that maybe,

78
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,120
which could be much wider, maybe much deeper.

79
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Now, you do something symbolic

80
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,600
which is very, the essence, the principle of something.

81
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
Like flowers are the -

82
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,000
they represent the principle of the Mother Earth.

83
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Now,

84
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,160
so the symbolicism of all the things

85
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,240
that we can offer to God has been meditated upon,

86
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,800
and has been found out.

87
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,120
So they use five things called as panchamruta,

88
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,480
as we have here.

89
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,560
Because if you have hit the principle,

90
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,840
then you have really hit the whole, isn't it.

91
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Because spiritual well-being is a total well-being.

92
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
It's not just partly that your material well-being

93
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,720
or your physical well-being, or your emotional well-being,

94
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
or your mental well-being.

95
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a total one, completely balanced into totality.

96
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,160
Now when you offer these other things like the,

97
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
we call them akshadas,

98
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,480
what do you call ?

99
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,680
Turmeric. Turmeric rice, you see, this yellow thing, you see.

100
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,120
When you offer this, you know, the yellow color

101
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
is that of the Swadisthana Chakra.

102
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,680
And rice is very dear to all the gods.

103
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,200
Now there's a trick in it, because it's a human trick.

104
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,560
Gods are fond of rice.

105
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,640
So they put turmeric on it,

106
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
means that "We offer to You a rice which is yellow-colored"

107
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,240
- means, "You should give us blessings of our creativity."

108
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,120
When you eat it, more creativity will flow

109
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,560
and we'll be blessed by that deity - it's a trick.

110
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,000
The whole thing of puja is the trick of human saints, you see,

111
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,320
how to trick God to give more blessings!

112
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,600
But whatever God likes, it has to be auspicious and holy.

113
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,280
So ultimately it works out for the

114
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,520
holiness of saints and their simple hearts.

115
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,040
Now, the puja cannot be done by a person who is not a realized soul.

116
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,080
A person who preaches also has to be a realized soul,

117
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,280
the one who does namaz has to be a realized soul,

118
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
the one who prays has to be a realized soul.

119
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,960
So all the utensils that are used are to be worshipped in a way

120
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,320
that they are to be holy things,

121
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,240
they are to be respected things.

122
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,920
You cannot use anything, say the one you are using in the bathroom

123
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,680
and you use the same thing for the puja, is absurd.

124
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,920
Three things are very important,

125
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,080
is a ghatah, means [UNCLEAR] the vessel,

126
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,000
vessel that contains the kundalini,

127
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,520
the vessel that contains the

128
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
primordial desire within us to get to God,

129
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,120
is first to be worshipped, our desire.

130
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,920
Is the ghatah, is the one made here.

131
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,920
And on top is called as a Shriphala.

132
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
Shriphala means this also has got water in it, if you  see,

133
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,680
the coconut represents the same thing.

134
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,240
Now in the subtler form it is

135
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,080
the water of all the rivers of the world.

136
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,480
And the coconut is the water of all the oceans.

137
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,000
The water from the ocean or sea

138
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,520
rises through the tree-trunk of the coconut,

139
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,040
and becomes the sweet water in the coconut.

140
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,920
It's a symbolic thing.

141
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,560
So this is the vessel called ghatah-puja, this is the ghatah-puja.

142
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Now, I don't want to go to details today,

143
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,760
because we have to talk about Ganesha.

144
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,360
The same is - now that is water, all right.

145
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,880
Then we have to worship Ghanta (bell) and Shankha (shell).

146
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,760
These are two representing the sound.

147
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,880
Shell.

148
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,640
Actually the Shankha represents the ether.

149
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,640
Then we have the Deepa, means what?

150
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,680
It's the light, represents the light element, called as tejas.

151
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,400
Normally also to the Goddess they also give Her a fan,

152
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,400
which represents the air element.

153
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
So this is how all the five elements

154
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,600
are pleased beforehand, using them.

155
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,560
So the essences of these or the causal essences

156
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,480
of these five elements

157
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,440
should be pleased at this time,

158
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,520
should be supporting the puja.

159
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,840
Now there are also all kinds of other things,

160
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,800
like your family deities, you might be

161
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,160
worshipping in your family some deities.

162
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
They should not be also at this time upsetting the puja;

163
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,000
or maybe the forefathers who are dead.

164
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,360
All these things are to be quietened,

165
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,640
so that they should be told that this is a puja like this,

166
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
and you do not disturb us at this time.

167
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,240
Means even thoughts should not come,

168
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,680
their thoughts or their - any disturbances.

169
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,680
So everything is to be first made into peace.

170
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,680
Now this is the one aspect I have told you in short,

171
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,600
because it's a very long thing. If I have to speak about it

172
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll have to speak at least three times,

173
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,440
and with three hours each time, still it may not be finished.

174
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Now we come to the second aspect,

175
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,680
which question I asked you "What do you,

176
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,000
how do you get benefited by it?"

177
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,280
So apart from this technique, to have the best

178
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,440
effect of the blessings

179
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,480
or the best flow of the Grace within us,

180
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,320
we say mantras.

181
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,840
The sound of mantras,

182
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,280
the sound, the sound echo

183
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,640
into the being of God.

184
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,040
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

185
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,320
and then the chakras start opening more.

186
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,200
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

187
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,760
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

188
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

189
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,920
It is a vicious circle.

190
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,800
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

191
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,640
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

192
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,920
And the chakras won't open by a person

193
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,000
who is not a realized soul.

194
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,720
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

195
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,160
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

196
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,120
and of all the saints, like you.

197
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,920
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

198
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,040
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

199
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,280
Once you raise the kundalini, the kundalini opens

200
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,400
the chakras a little bit,

201
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,320
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

202
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,600
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

203
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,280
behind the seeker, she rises.

204
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,480
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

205
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,640
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

206
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,360
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

207
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,840
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

208
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,600
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.

209
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,920
That's why in the beginning we don't tell them about the mantras,

210
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,640
because in the mantras you have to accept Me as the Deity.

211
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,920
In this advent of Mine it is made compulsory

212
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,280
that you have to recognize Me.

213
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,040
Because this is very precarious,

214
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,280
the Resurrection Time we can call it,

215
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,680
or the time of your Last Judgment.

216
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,840
First the realization has to be given

217
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,120
without any recognition.

218
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,880
But not to those who are denying or insulting Me.

219
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,320
Under any circumstances they cannot get realization,

220
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,840
whatever you may try.

221
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,800
Even after realization if people start thinking against Me,

222
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,840
vibrations will stop,

223
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,480
because of Sahasrara.

224
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,480
And the heart has to be

225
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
completely in unison with Me,

226
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,400
otherwise Sahasrara is closed.

227
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,200
Now those people who are simple,

228
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,840
who are full of open heart, you see,

229
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
such people understand Me very well and

230
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,480
they just put Me in their hearts.

231
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,880
After realization,

232
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,200
after going through the understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

233
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,480
through their mental activity, also the intellectuals understand Me

234
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,680
and recognize Me in a little circuitous way.

235
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,800
After the puja, when they receive the blessings,

236
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,160
a very blissful state they achieve,

237
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,080
then they realize the value of puja also - afterwards.

238
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,160
Now in India,

239
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,320
where the puja system has been traditionally coming

240
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,800
and has been maintained quite a lot,

241
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,080
they understand it without any mental processes.

242
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,240
But when they meet somebody, an intellectual,

243
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,160
who has become a Sahaja yogi, you see

244
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,760
they can't understand them.

245
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
They don't want to listen about it,

246
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,440
the whole rigmarole of the whole movement of the brain.

247
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,680
And some of them who try, you see, a little westernized,

248
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,160
they try, you see; they develop an inferiority complex,

249
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,640
and they go to the left side.

250
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,320
But there is no need to understand it with mental,

251
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,040
I mean, to all the time analyzing through your mental process,

252
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,560
and then to understand everything,

253
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,840
and then become Sahaja yogis with the heart open.

254
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,000
This is rather very circuitous.

255
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,960
But what to do? They have gone that way,

256
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,920
so they have to come that way.

257
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,760
Because even if they become Sahaja yogis,

258
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,040
they start questioning and thinking about it,

259
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,880
and worrying about it.

260
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,000
So the false people just mesmerize them

261
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,160
and take advantage of that mesmerism.

262
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,280
So one should not feel bad.

263
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,720
If you feel like analyzing, you should go ahead with it,

264
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,760
because I cannot stop your speed,

265
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm not going to mesmerize you.

266
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,280
In Sahaja Yoga the freedom is to be respected.

267
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,120
But we do not allow people to come for puja

268
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,240
who have not achieved a certain amount

269
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,120
of understanding mentally of Sahaja Yoga

270
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,480
- from the Western people, not in India,

271
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,280
but here there is a restriction.

272
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,560
Because supposing in India I do not explain to them,

273
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,040
they don't want to know.

274
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,240
They know that they'll get vibrations.

275
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,080
They already know about vibrations,

276
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,160
so I don't have to tell them "You will get more vibrations."

277
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,880
If they get more vibrations they know I am the Shakti,

278
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,080
that's all, I don't have to explain it.

279
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,960
Like as you can make out which is the best wine,

280
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,480
they can make out who is the real person.

281
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,600
They know the taste of it.

282
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,240
Now, once in a puja

283
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,240
I had about six thousand people that touched My Feet.

284
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,280
So I said, "In a puja now, please don't have

285
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,280
- the people need not touch My Feet." I said it.

286
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,120
But they thought it was Dhumal who suggested,

287
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,000
so they all got after his life.

288
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,080
They said, "You only want to take all the blessings

289
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,640
from Mother's Feet, and you didn't want us to take it",

290
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,120
and they got after him.

291
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,560
Another thing is, you see, in the West

292
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,280
I never used to make the panchamruta with My Feet but with My Hands,

293
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,040
because here people would think that

294
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,040
that's a dirty thing feet is,

295
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,480
and we should not have of the feet, you see.

296
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,880
But actually the Feet are very powerful,

297
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,920
and they can never be dirty.

298
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,240
Like the River Ganges has vibrations.

299
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
If you have the water of Ganges

300
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,960
you will see that it will never be dirtied.

301
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,880
On the contrary, whatever are inside that

302
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,320
because it's never sort of very kept clean,

303
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,240
whatever dirt has gone into it,

304
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,040
it settles down and doesn't dirty the thing at all.

305
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,080
It's very clean water, all the time vibrating.

306
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,360
So one must understand whatever is pure,

307
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,120
which is responsible for purity,

308
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,720
which is the source of purity,

309
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,480
can cleanse any impurity. So how it can be impure?

310
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,400
But with the brain if you think it, it's so limited.

311
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,000
You cannot think of something which is just

312
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,200
the embodiment of purity.

313
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,440
This is the point we have come now,

314
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,960
where I think I should talk about the Absolute.

315
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,960
That is Shri Ganesha.

316
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,400
Today is His Puja.

317
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,960
It's a very great thing

318
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,600
that this Puja we are doing in Geneva in Switzerland.

319
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,800
Geneva is the right Heart, I think.

320
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,840
The way it is against right Heart.

321
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,440
Everybody's life is a tragedy, like Rama and [UNCLEAR].

322
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,960
And that is why it is very important

323
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,680
that Shri Ganesha should be worshipped here.

324
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,280
Now Shri Ganesha, as you know,

325
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,400
is the embodiment of innocence.

326
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,800
Now Ganesha's color is red or orangish.

327
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,640
Because the child, when it is conceived as a fetus,

328
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,760
the first color it sees is orange

329
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,160
of the red wall of the mother's womb, of the blood.

330
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,040
In Sahaja Yoga, now you must have learnt

331
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,640
that every action has a reaction, which acts.

332
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,320
The color of the original,

333
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,480
we can say the primordial

334
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,080
Ganesha is just of the clay,

335
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,000
because He is made out of Mother Earth.

336
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,800
Now when the Gauri, the Mother of Ganesha created Him

337
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,360
to protect Her chastity while She was having Her bath,

338
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,840
She colored Him red, because everybody could see that

339
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,760
there's somebody sitting there to protect Her.

340
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,840
So when you see the red color around you as a fetus,

341
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,840
then you absorb that color,

342
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,080
and your Ganesha gets colored

343
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,040
with the red in the same beautiful manner.

344
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,400
Just it has a reaction of that getting red and it acts,

345
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,280
means red color of a Ganesha,

346
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,840
the one who has a red color of a Ganesha, frightens others.

347
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,840
They know there is Ganesha sitting there,

348
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,880
a pure, changed personality

349
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,920
with all the fieriness of the Ganesha is there.

350
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Now this Ganesha when He is in a childhood,

351
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,480
as you see, when the child is born,

352
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,040
the children are extremely

353
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,080
protective or fiery, you can say,

354
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,400
about anybody touching their innocence.

355
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,880
When they are absolutely young they are not even aware of it.

356
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,560
But slightly, as soon as they start growing,

357
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,320
they become very aware and they don't like

358
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,160
their clothes to be taken out in the presence of others.

359
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:30,000
They become very shy of their innocence.

360
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,240
I mean, not shy, shyness is not -

361
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,160
in the sense of their nudity, very shy of their nudity,

362
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,680
so that their innocence should not be attacked.

363
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,560
If their innocence is not attacked and if they are pure,

364
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,240
if they see a nude woman they'll close their eyes.

365
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,400
They would not like to see a nude woman,

366
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,680
or a nude man.

367
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,080
So this is an innate understanding,

368
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,280
an intuitive understanding that it is important

369
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,880
that they must preserve their innocence.

370
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,640
Now, what is the innocence within us?

371
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,120
What does it do to us?

372
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,360
As it is, already I've told you that it gives us wisdom.

373
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,320
All kinds of stupidity we do with our ego;

374
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,040
as I was describing the president

375
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,520
and so many others at that age

376
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,040
and at that height of their positions,

377
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:10,200
it is because the Ganesha is missing completely.

378
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,360
We went to Brighton where they have a beach,

379
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,360
sort of a - beach where you can do nude things.

380
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,240
And My maid, she is innocent, you see, we went there,

381
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,480
and she couldn't understand, you see.

382
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,360
She asked Me, "But why are they doing it?"

383
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,320
But as you will find that in the West it's hard to find

384
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,920
a really a wise person.

385
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,720
You can say that the people are over-educated

386
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,200
and they are very well-equipped with other understanding

387
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,280
of the material side of life and all that.

388
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,280
But as far as the wisdom is concerned,

389
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,480
one can get shocked the way they are. I mean,

390
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,640
just don't understand, what's the wisdom behind it?

391
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,400
Because all their wisdom has become nothing but sex.

392
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,040
They always think of sex,

393
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:07,160
and they always want to understand all the nonsense of the sex.

394
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,840
If you start thinking about your sex,

395
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,800
naturally your innocence will be destroyed right there.

396
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:44,000
Because you cannot use your intelligence for sex.

397
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,200
I don't understand the wisdom how you can rationalize sex.

398
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,840
This is such a spontaneous thing.

399
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,360
And by thinking about it, are you going to enjoy it?

400
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,800
How can you?

401
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,440
It would be like saying that we can transform a flower

402
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,040
into a fruit by thinking.

403
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,640
And the more serious thing is this way,

404
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,800
that supposing you say "I can"

405
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,280
- of course you can never think like, I hope so, that

406
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,880
you can transform a flower into a fruit, I hope so.

407
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,480
But some people can think that

408
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,760
"I can shift," say for example,

409
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,960
"this thing from here to here, with my mind I can shift it."

410
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,080
Or materialize things.

411
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,600
So you know that you can do it, you believe that you can do it,

412
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,480
because some people have done it.

413
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,360
But as Sahaja yogis you know it is done by bhoots,

414
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,560
by dead spirits, they do it for you,

415
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,560
because they are busybodies trying to help you.

416
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:44,240
Now, same thing happens as far as sex is concerned.

417
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,840
When you want to have sex through your intellectual pursuits,

418
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,160
you get only the bhoots to do that for you.

419
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,840
Because when you project too much of your mind,

420
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,080
then it goes into areas where you catch them.

421
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,480
And they are sometimes very sly, sometimes depraved,

422
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,640
sometimes aggressive, all kinds of things you gather,

423
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:53,880
and the result is that the sex becomes a nonsense.

424
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,720
So many depraved people

425
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,320
are satisfied once they attack you,

426
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,200
and you have either a very excited sex,

427
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,760
that even if you rape hundred women you are not satisfied,

428
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,120
or you'll have an impotency of the worst type.

429
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,000
So I mean, you are always left dissatisfied.

430
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,240
All such people when they die they also become the same bhoots,

431
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,240
waiting for some sex fellow to come around, and jump on him.

432
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,320
Innocent persons also may not have any sex activity

433
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,440
for many years, even after marriage,

434
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,280
because they are so innocent.

435
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,560
It could be so also with very childlike people.

436
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,080
But here it's a science which is taught from childhood

437
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,880
- just imagine. What is the need?

438
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,400
Do the animals have to learn anything from childhood,

439
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
about sex? They produce children too.

440
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,320
(You have said?)

441
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,800
So the asceticism

442
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,400
is not what I am teaching.

443
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,920
First, the innocence is protective and red,

444
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,120
say till the age of, at the most, fifty years.

445
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,240
Then gradually, if the person is properly maturing,

446
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,240
not the stupid people but who are maturing properly,

447
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,640
after fifty it starts becoming orange.

448
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,160
It becomes orange.

449
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,040
Means when you get married this process

450
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,280
of this redness goes away

451
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,120
and it becomes, starts becoming orange.

452
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,840
That means the protection part is over.

453
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,560
Means, before marriage the virginity has to be preserved.

454
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,280
Till you meet the person with whom you are to be married,

455
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,240
that redness is the protection of that virginity.

456
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,680
Then, when you are married,

457
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,000
the protection part of it is not needed.

458
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,760
But it has to be only towards one person,

459
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,360
that's your husband or wife.

460
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,400
Then the proper maturity takes place,

461
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,200
and by the time you are about fifty years of age

462
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,280
it becomes orange - means there's detachment.

463
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,120
You don't feel like having any more sex life.

464
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,280
There's no need also.

465
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,360
And then you develop a,

466
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,440
what you call a

467
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,960
proper matured innocence which is,

468
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:29,280
can be compared with a

469
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:35,320
properly baked earthenware.

470
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,280
So old age is the really the golden age,

471
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,920
where a person has got that wisdom

472
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,560
shining through the complete behavior of that person.

473
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,440
But why - again, why to have this maturity,

474
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,200
why to have this innocence?

475
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,680
Again, because you are rational people,

476
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,120
so one can ask the question, why?

477
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:26,160
Innocence is the way you really give fun to others,

478
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,280
create the fun part of it.

479
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,440
The fun is created only through innocence.

480
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,320
And innocence is the only way you can really

481
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,400
emit also the fun.

482
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,760
Imagine this world without any fun, what would happen?

483
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:27,000
But people are very much confused with the fun

484
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,960
and the pleasures.

485
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:49,120
The pleasure is nice to begin with,

486
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,560
and horrible to end with.

487
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,480
But fun is a treasure.

488
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,360
Anything that is full of fun you remember all your life,

489
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,720
you can tell others, it's such an embodiment of fun-creation.

490
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,040
Yogi: There's no word in French for "fun"!

491
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:44,040
Can you imagine, this French language is diplomatic

492
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,080
- no word for "fun"!

493
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,200
Like I'll give you a simple example

494
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,800
how these children create fun out of something.

495
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,600
They make everything into a fun, you see.

496
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,120
And now, you see, even when they speak

497
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,760
or they say things also they create such a fun out of it.

498
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,240
The other day My youngest grandchild,

499
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,480
that's Anupama - she's hardly now six years -

500
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:27,280
was playing and she went up to the top of the house somewhere,

501
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,560
and then we heard a big thud, you see.

502
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,960
And My daughter, she's a very frantic mother,

503
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,160
always worried about her children's well-being.

504
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,040
Fun, eh?

505
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,440
And she couldn't even walk, you see,

506
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,720
her legs became heavy with worry,

507
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,400
and she was walking to find out what's coming down now.

508
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,280
So she shouted for the child and the child came running down,

509
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,840
she was quite all right.

510
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,680
So she shouted at her, and she said,

511
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,280
"What happened? Where did you go? Why did you go up?"

512
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,640
She just started shouting at her.

513
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,440
So this child looked at her, quite puzzled,

514
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:03,000
and she waited for her to stop her shouting.

515
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,160
And she said very quietly,

516
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,360
"I've not come all the way from Riadh here to die!"

517
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,960
So there are so many things which you write it down,

518
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,320
it's all fun, and natural fun

519
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,960
that they have out of everything.

520
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,920
You see, we can have now here all the children who are here,

521
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,560
there's so many things you can write them down,

522
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,440
how beautiful things they are doing,

523
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,320
and how there is a twinkle of a mischief in their eyes,

524
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,920
that they want to create a fun out of everything.

525
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:55,000
Fun is joy-giving, it gives you joy.

526
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,080
It's not just a sort of a coaxing in any way,

527
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:03,280
or a hurting in any way or anything sadistic in it,

528
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,120
but it's just a blossoming.

529
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,120
Yogi: Mother, do You think it's possible

530
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,600
if we don't translate any more,

531
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,480
because it takes too much time for that

532
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,400
I think so

533
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,480
Yogi: English words, we'll tell them at the end,

534
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,360
also the few who don't understand English,

535
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,200
we'll explain them at the end, what You have said.

536
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,480
All right for you? Because I'm coming to an end, Gregoire,

537
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,640
as I finish at twelve-thirty, so let's do it for today.

538
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,200
But the next time I think it's a better idea

539
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,760
to translate it later.

540
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,880
Just little bit I'll translate more, because we are coming

541
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,760
to an end, and that's why it's taken so much time, otherwise

542
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,360
it will be one-third of the time.

543
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,680
Yes, just translate this part what I've said is,

544
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,480
that fun is nothing but blossoming.

545
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It doesn't tease anyone, it doesn't hurt anyone,

546
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,840
doesn't trouble anyone but just blossoms,

547
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,040
the whole thing, into fragrance.

548
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,640
It is the Divine's trick.

549
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,720
It has something higher than that also,

550
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,720
that if you are innocent,

551
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,840
you really can feel the joy.

552
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,600
So an innocent person can feel the joy

553
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,880
of something which a very serious

554
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,480
and a very rational person may never see.

555
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,120
An innocent person may laugh loudly at a thing,

556
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,240
to other people it may not be something funny.

557
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,640
So the fun-creation is not a dubious thing,

558
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,280
it's a very straightforward, simple,

559
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,480
a spontaneous blossoming.

560
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:59,880
Now in Geneva, people are really very serious about everything.

561
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,200
More so in Switzerland.

562
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,960
So much so that they commit suicide as a result.

563
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,080
Because you are money-oriented,

564
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,720
and you are also a sort of a,

565
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,880
take up a role of helping the whole world.

566
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,400
Means you are very ego-oriented,

567
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,480
because you want to help the whole world. Who are you to help?

568
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,680
And thirdly, you have a stupid military here

569
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,960
which is not needed at all.

570
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,760
Yogini: Mother, excuse me,

571
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,040
You know that yesterday it was in the newspapers

572
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,280
that there had been again a military airplane

573
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,560
which crashed in Switzerland, with two deaths.

574
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,760
With Your photo next to it.

575
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,560
It's too much to blame Me!

576
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,040
Yogini: He says, it was during a show

577
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,440
where they wanted to show off all the military strength.

578
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,800
That's the fun

579
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,920
- that's the fun, you see?

580
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,000
So everybody is happy about it, you see,

581
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,520
that this is the one how you see is funny.

582
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:03,800
Now to help the fun more, we have got Hanumana.

583
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,000
He helps the fun part of Shri Ganesh.

584
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,400
Like a,

585
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:40,240
like Ganesha who plays tricks

586
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,480
of fun on the people who are left-sided,

587
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:47,320
He plays His tricks on the right-sided people.

588
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:22,080
Like there is a person who was crying too much,

589
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,880
her husband is dead, "Now what to do? I am finished,"

590
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,560
this thing, that thing, you see

591
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,400
- and suddenly she sees her husband walking in the room!

592
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,240
But this only He does to the people who are innocent.

593
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,640
But to the cunning, He punishes.

594
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,760
He'll go on pouring all kinds of miseries,

595
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,440
one more than the other, and He'll say,

596
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,120
"Now cry more, and cry more. You want to cry?

597
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,240
All right, have it more, and have it more."

598
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,720
And Hanumana on His side -  say for example,

599
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:15,280
when Lakshmana was sick and He had to get some medicine

600
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:19,520
from one big mountain,

601
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,240
He brought the whole mountain, you see.

602
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,080
Because He said, "I had no time to find it, you see,

603
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,200
so better find it now," and brought the whole mountain.

604
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,960
He too is the same style,

605
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:35,160
can be very destructive

606
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,240
when it comes to egoistical people,

607
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,680
like Ravana - whole Lanka he burnt.

608
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:22,840
If Ganesha is painted red, He is painted orange.

609
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:38,840
And as Ganesha has to settle down permanently in one place,

610
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,880
He uses Saint Michael to run up and down the left side.

611
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,480
While Hanumana can run up and down,

612
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,480
He need not settle down at a place.

613
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:34,640
But though He is a settled Deity, Sthita,

614
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,760
is the one who is to be settled

615
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,120
- once He's settled, then He emits vibrations

616
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,440
which go everywhere.

617
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,840
He is the source of innocence.

618
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,040
He is the source of the vibrations.

619
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,640
He is everything, in a way.

620
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,880
When He ascends here as Mahaganesha within you,

621
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,760
and in God He descends as Ganesha

622
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,080
- from here, on the back.

623
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,760
So when you think too much about sex,

624
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:36,160
your eyes get ruined, because you are using Mahaganesha.

625
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,240
Your Mahaganesha is spoilt,

626
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,400
and your eyes starts wobbling.

627
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,480
The eyes lose innocence, purity,

628
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:33,360
and they start absorbing all that is filth.

629
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:47,400
The eyes which are pure and innocent

630
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,600
give innocence to others.

631
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:06,600
Not only that, but they are the eyes,

632
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,640
are the eyes through which the spirit looks out.

633
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,640
It has many combinations which I have no time to tell you,

634
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,960
but it's a very bad thing

635
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,120
that people get those unclean eyes, the bhootish eyes.

636
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,560
And anybody who is bhootish around

637
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,880
will turn their eyes to that person,

638
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,720
because it's a play of the satanic now playing now,

639
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,640
the negative.

640
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,360
And that is what we do when

641
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:39,200
we do not place Ganesha at right places.

642
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,360
If we have to make Ganesha reflected

643
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,920
in our Mahaganesha state at this point,

644
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,600
we should try to keep our eyes very clean,

645
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:30,800
so that you keep the seat of Mahaganesha clean.

646
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,960
In the Puja of Shri Ganesh

647
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,720
you must bring the soft grass also,

648
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:54,160
because durva, He's fond of Durva,

649
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:58,360
durva, that's called as durva- because the soft grass

650
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,200
is soothing to the eyes.

651
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:08,000
Not only that, but it gives you the green part

652
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,600
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

653
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,440
Which -  he exists when we have not started about thinking,

654
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,920
you have not started the thinking process.

655
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,920
That suggests that part of Swadisthana,

656
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,160
when you are not thinking,

657
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:30,040
the green part of it, the lower part of the Swadisthana is green.

658
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,800
So the green is the one:

659
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,800
at that stage we have not become human beings,

660
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,280
at that stage it represents the green of Swadisthana,

661
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,800
where it created the whole universe, everything.

662
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,440
Up to that it's green.

663
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,760
Then when it starts creating the ego

664
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,400
it becomes the yellow color, where it uses the sun,

665
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,880
the action part.

666
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,640
Not "uses" the sun but becomes active,

667
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,960
representing the sun side.

668
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:33,960
So the green represents actually the part of

669
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,280
Ganesha, part of Ganesha in a way,

670
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,760
because till then you are not thinking.

671
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,080
You are at a level

672
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,560
where you are close to the Mother Earth, you see.

673
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,640
So the Mother Earth is giving, you see.

674
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,160
The sun part has not started when the green is there,

675
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,480
because the Mother Earth gives this green.

676
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:55,360
Of course the sun makes it green, that's different point,

677
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,720
but that you don't start doing it.

678
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,280
When you start doing something yourself at a human level,

679
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,440
the whole thing becomes yellow.

680
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,280
So Swadisthana has two sides,

681
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,600
the physical and the mental side.

682
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,480
The physical side is the green side,

683
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:13,240
and the mental side is the yellow side.

684
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:40,160
So now we are today here to worship Shri Ganesh.

685
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:45,240
Now I would like you to get some grass from the [UNCLEAR]

686
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,800
some soft grass, because that's an important part of it.

687
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:00,400
So you should put your eyes onto the greenery

688
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,920
to improve your Ganesha.

689
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,880
And when  it is very warm,

690
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:35,680
then you can also walk barefeet on the green

691
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,040
in the morning-time, when the dew is on it.

692
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,560
Those who are very overactive

693
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,680
should take to the vegetarian diet,

694
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,480
it will help them to become more towards the balanced side.

695
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:19,640
Not as a fanaticism, but more on vegetables,

696
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,040
and eat animals which are very small ones,

697
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,040
so it's all right.

698
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,680
But today I've not talked about His vahana and all that,

699
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,600
because I have talked in other lectures.

700
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:20,120
His vahana - His conveyance - I have not talked about it,

701
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:25,160
because I've talked about it in other lectures of Mine about Him.

702
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:41,160
This is the best if you can find this,

703
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,680
like this kind, very thin one

704
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,520
this kind, this is good one.

705
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,480
This one, it's all right

706
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:11,160
You can get more now, just ...

707
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:24,160
With this the water is sprinkled on the Feet.

708
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,640
Those who have not washed My Feet

709
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,400
should wash My Feet today.

710
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,480
Oh, that's good, that's the thing!

711
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:46,560
He got it exactly what I mean, exactly the thing.

712
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,560
This is very good one, yes.

713
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,680
Oh, but still some of them are hard, doesn't matter.

714
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,160
It is this kind which has round,

715
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,640
the round blades.

716
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,440
You can take it out, some of them?

717
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:08,040
These round blades, the round blades.

718
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:09,680
This is the round one,

719
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,680
not the flat but the round.

720
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,520
Not with the edge, but they're round ones.

721
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,520
Now let him do it.

722
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:31,440
They're round, are they? Round?

723
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,360
Yes, that's it, that's it. That will do.

724
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,160
They are not round also. Round ones.

725
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:47,560
All right? They're all flat. There's one round.

726
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:50,280
No, this is flat too.

727
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:53,040
I don't think you have here in this country.

728
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:57,440
I think we should get some ...

729
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,120
This will do.

730
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:05,680
You just tie them with a string, that's all.

731
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,040
That will do, that is sufficient,

732
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,400
just to tie it with this, some sort of a stick.

733
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:16,160
Just tie it up with a little string round it,

734
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:20,040
and use it for sprinkling water.

735
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,560
They are called as durvan gulah,

736
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:37,400
means the seedlings, seedlings of that.

737
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:42,160
Yogi: Mother, this is used for Easter

738
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:43,040
What ?

739
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:46,680
Easter [UNCLEAR] challenger put the eggs in this kind of grass

740
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,240
for the children

741
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,120
Is it?

742
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,160
Yogi: Not in England

743
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:52,520
What do they do?

744
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,280
Yogi: The eggs for the children Easter,

745
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,640
put it in this kind of grass. [UNCLEAR]

746
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:02,680
Just see. Oh, that's correct!

747
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:13,200
Good.

748
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,680
Thank you.

749
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,240
Tie it up, this one also. Good.

750
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,320
Can you tie this with the string?

751
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:31,000
That's nice, that's good. Have you got some more?

752
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,400
It's better to have bigger ones, all right?

753
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,040
Because we haven't got much choice.

754
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:50,200
Now, those who have to wash Feet.

755
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,480
Those people who haven't washed My Feet should come forward.

756
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,160
Let her come, let her come.

757
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:21,160
I'm so happy you could come!

758
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,600
So nice to see you! All right.

759
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:34,040
Now, come here. One should do the washing,

760
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,280
and somebody should start doing this.

761
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,480
You can ask him. Yes, come along.

762
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,400
Good, good, good. Now, this will be after the puja, all right?

763
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:51,560
So all the four young children, where are they?

764
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:04,560
Where's Anand?

765
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:12,640
These have to wash Me first. Now, let Me see.

766
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:17,440
What about these four things I gave you,

767
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,600
for the children?

768
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:26,400
All right, where have the children gone, four of them?

769
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,560
No, one ...

770
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,040
All right, we'll have these four. Come along.

771
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:41,600
All right, now come along.

772
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:43,560
You - first of all the children should come

773
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:46,160
and wash My Feet, come along, first of all.

774
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,600
All the children, come along, come along!

775
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:55,360
Hold on. Wash My Feet. All right. Put some water,

776
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,520
I think ...

777
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:19,680
Where is she? Marie-Amelia, Marie-Amelia?

778
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,600
And also the yellow one you bring from there,

779
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:26,120
one yellow one ...

780
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:43,160
Rub it hard, rub it hard.

781
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:54,280
May God bless you all.

782
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:58,480
Good. Now, Wyson is younger to her, is he?

783
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:15,440
Barbara is younger one, all right. So, now.

784
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,400
Hallo ... this is for you ... all right?

785
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:27,080
Barbara, that should be given, dakshina, you see?

786
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,320
All right, according to the sizes

787
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,480
I have given them to them each. All right ...

788
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:32,280
Done, done!

789
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:36,040
Now, just take out the thing.

790
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,440
This should be given to the people for the head

791
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,680
- some leaders.

792
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:43,360
Ask the children, they'll do it, how to put it on the head.

793
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:46,320
Ask Lawrence to do it.

794
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,520
Something should be under My Feet:

795
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,400
a towel, somebody should do that.

796
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:00,160
I think somebody who knows this should be here.

797
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:04,480
Somebody to wipe My Feet.

798
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,160
Can you, the one who doesn't have a camera?

799
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,320
Come along.

800
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:19,320
The towels could be there, just to wipe My Feet.

801
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:46,640
Here, just to put it here. Tell them not to drop.

802
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:49,600
Just to put it there.

803
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:34,560
So they cannot be, has to be Chaturthi,

804
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:37,600
according to Indians. You see, Chaturthi.

805
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:41,080
It has to be also Chaturdashi,   it could be.

806
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,000
When was this rakhi?

807
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:48,360
Yogi: Seventeen days, sixteen days ago.

808
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,600
Sixteen days ago, so it is after rakhi...

809
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,320
Yogi: Two days after new moon, two days after new moon

810
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,280
But it is, has to be Chatur Dashi,

811
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,640
fourth day it has to be in Indian time,

812
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,600
because Chaturthi's the day he's established.

813
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,160
Because Indian, you see, is different a little bit.

814
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,480
Must be starting now. Twelve o'clock!

815
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,680
So you need the translators.

816
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:37,400
It's the Chaturthi, has to be. You see how it works out.

817
02:09:53,240 --> 02:09:56,320
Now, those who have not washed My Feet have to come.

818
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:02,240
Now, what you do is to take that ... now first.

819
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:05,400
Use this for water ...

820
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:36,160
Those who have, who have not washed please come

821
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:41,040
... cold water for them to wash My Feet.

822
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:44,320
You have to wash My Feet.

823
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:49,200
You have to rub. You have to rub My Feet hard, hard.

824
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,320
Rub it. Rub it.

825
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:57,120
You rub My right, and ... the lower part, the lower part.

826
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:01,680
Rub it, yes, rub it. Rub it hard.

827
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:07,160
Hard, hard, hard. Rub it here.

828
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:10,520
Hard, hard, very hard.

829
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:14,520
Here ...

830
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:33,440
Just keep this water for drinking, not for put ... in,

831
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:38,200
but keep it in somewhere, a bottle or something.

832
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:58,280
Good, now.

833
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:06,480
You're all right. All right? That's right.

834
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,320
Now, you realize that by rubbing My Feet

835
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:11,200
you've got your vibrations more,

836
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,440
so rationally you understand.

837
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,280
May God bless you.

838
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,320
Are you getting more now?

839
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,680
May God bless.

840
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:52,360
Now others can come.

841
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:11,320
Not to hold, but to rub more.

842
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:16,160
Not to hold too much, but to rub it.

843
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:26,320
Have you been to Hare Rama, have you?

844
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:28,080
Yogi: No, he's not been.

845
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,040
But he does the mantras ...

846
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:36,000
Yogi: Yes, he was in Rome, and he was before also,

847
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,560
he is from Sicily.

848
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:42,640
Why his right Vishuddhi is catching? Right Vishuddhi?

849
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:51,200
Yogi: Ah, yes, he was smoking before, Mother,

850
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:54,160
but he doesn't smoke any more ...

851
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:48,040
Better now? ... Good.

852
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:28,320
Now he has to read about Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha.

853
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,640
Your fingers should be rubbed,

854
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:54,320
your fingers should be rubbed like this.

855
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:00,040
Your fingers are doing it, not Me.

856
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,120
You are to rub your fingers

857
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:07,240
so that they become more sensitive, all right?

858
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,640
Come here, come ...

859
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:36,160
Now, listen to what he's saying, all right?

860
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:50,560
... Now, he's reading. Now listen to him.

861
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:26,480
That means awakening of Christ within us,

862
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:30,160
awakening of Shri Ganesha within us.

863
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:53,280
Now enjoy yourself!

864
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,120
There are lots of yellow flowers here.

865
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:12,320
What is it - now the flowers?

866
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:05,480
You can put these first, I think, that will absorb easily.

867
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,680
Finished with towels. One on top.

868
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:23,440
Now, what is it, Gavin?

869
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:28,280
First of all the washing needs to be done,

870
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:32,560
better do it then, and pushpam ...

871
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,200
All the washing should be done first, then these.

872
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:49,360
So would you like them to wash My Feet or Hands?

873
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:54,320
Yogi: They've asked to ask for Your Feet.

874
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,520
All right. You come here.

875
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:59,200
Let somebody who is free sometimes.

876
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:02,040
You come along, you can do. Yes, ...

877
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:06,160
You come along too. These two can - you two here.

878
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,480
So what we can do is we can work out,

879
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:11,600
because they have to be Swiss - put it down there,

880
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:15,080
all right - and she's German, so ...

881
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,520
You come this side, all right?

882
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:21,520
Now, you pour the water.

883
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,160
You will be in charge of water, all right.

884
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:28,240
Now they will do the rest. Now tell them whatever is puja ...

885
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:36,680
Whatever Gavin says.

886
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:49,160
Pour Me some water in the hand.

887
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:53,120
See, there's a spoon here somewhere, a spoon.

888
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:55,280
So do that.

889
02:24:55,440 --> 02:25:00,040
You have to pour it there, then pour more water.

890
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:12,320
This is [UNCLEAR]

891
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:18,480
so that your Mother doesn't feel thirsty, all right?

892
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:21,360
Now, what is it? ...

893
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:27,480
Same thing is about Amrut.

894
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:37,000
Yogi: Now we make the bath of five nectars.

895
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:40,440
It's called the Panchamrut, the five nectars.

896
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:46,640
First is the ghee.

897
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,600
You need more milk, but little hot milk.

898
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,600
Hot milk. Something hot.

899
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,200
Yogi: Second one's the milk.

900
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:51,120
Milk should be the last one, it's better.

901
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:55,560
See, because they are now heating up. What is the next?

902
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:54,120
Now, have they got the milk?

903
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:02,680
... with some water.

904
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:11,280
Yogi: I already asked for it, Mother.

905
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:18,440
Yogi: Sugar next, Mother?

906
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,680
Last, should be, because it's ....

907
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:27,160
They have got it ...

908
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:53,040
Yogini: It's too hot, Mother.

909
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:59,320
Put some water. You put some water ...

910
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:10,320
It's all right, I hope so.

911
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:36,560
Quite all right. Take a little cold water, then.

912
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:39,480
It's all right.

913
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,680
It's all right now, it's not so hot.

914
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:53,560
And if it becomes hot I'll tell you.

915
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:57,000
Put some sugar I think, in between, would be better,

916
02:31:57,240 --> 02:32:01,080
and that will reduce some of the temperature.

917
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:23,680
Now pour some water over the whole thing. Water.

918
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:30,280
Pour some more water, a little bit.

919
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:34,000
So better clean it out.

920
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,080
And on the toes.

921
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,680
Thank you.

922
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:03,280
Vibrations are very nice.

923
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,120
Now, bring the towels.

924
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:20,400
Give her one, give her one towel.

925
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:17,680
Done.

926
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:22,320
Such vibrations there, and the hands are shaking!

927
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:27,640
Put it down ... because the hands are shaking with vibrations!

928
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,440
Just put it down.

929
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:35,280
Such vibrations are there.

930
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:47,120
Tremendous! Are they?

931
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:43,480
May God bless you. And this has vibrations also.

932
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:47,520
Just put it on your faces, you'll see the vibrations.

933
02:36:58,320 --> 02:37:00,640
May God bless. You can push them down.

934
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:04,200
Let them see. On the faces they can see vibrations.

935
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:06,560
May God bless.

936
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:14,280
You have to be here with us.

937
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:17,160
You have to put flowers, you see.

938
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:22,160
Now, married ladies.

939
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,040
All right. Now, you put the ...

940
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:35,240
I think first the unmarried should put the kumkum.

941
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,400
Unmarried ladies.

942
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:47,160
In Sahaja Yoga you hardly find them!

943
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:18,480
We have seven, I think.

944
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:21,360
Three, four, five, six, seven - good.

945
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:25,160
Annie, come along, you're unmarried.

946
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:28,040
Or are you married?

947
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,320
It's just you have to try it, that's all.

948
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:36,160
You see now, what you have to put is all this ...

949
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:53,520
First put the line, it's best is to put the line straight,

950
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:55,680
like that. First put the line.

951
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,480
No, the front line - yes.

952
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:01,400
Best is to put the front line, then it's better. And now ...

953
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:10,280
Very red today, eh? From where did you get this?

954
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:15,080
Very red, isn't it? This kumkum is very red.

955
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:20,320
This is a special one. Shri Ganesha is there! ...

956
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:30,240
Yogi: Mother, shall we read these names now?

957
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:32,680
Yes - no, Ganesha's?

958
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:35,680
But I'll have to do the havana later on.

959
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,560
You can do hundred-and-eight of Devi's names.

960
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,400
Devi's names you can read, what Gregoire has given you.

961
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,240
That's a good one.

962
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:44,680
Gauri's names, yeah.

963
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:47,000
She's Gauri, you see, She's a Virgin.

964
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:50,040
Virgin is the Mother of Shri Ganesha.

965
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:52,160
So Her names can be read.

966
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:00,680
So put your hands with the ...

967
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:03,520
With your left hand ...

968
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:08,680
Rub it on. Rub it on.

969
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:31,520
You can read the names of the Virgin,

970
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:34,360
that Gregoire has given you.

971
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:38,520
You can read them in French, somebody, and in English.

972
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:42,280
Gregoire can do it, Gregoire will do it.

973
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:54,680
Yogi: I read the Latin, and then I translate in English?

974
02:43:55,080 --> 02:43:56,480
Yes.

975
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:10,440
Now, the married ladies.

976
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:14,360
How many ... are here?

977
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:18,200
How many of you came?

978
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:23,040
Unmarried ladies, how many were here?

979
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:35,320
Seven.

980
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:38,480
So can you bring those plants,

981
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:44,160
seven plants should be given to those unmarried people.

982
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:47,520
Seven plants from outside ...

983
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:50,240
Plants,

984
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:53,000
plants that we bought ...

985
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:28,080
Seven of them, yeah.

986
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:33,120
You have? All right, I'll give them. Come along.

987
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:37,520
I want you to look after them. Unmarried ...

988
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:59,400
May God bless you ...

989
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:48,160
Bring one more.

990
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:55,680
And now, coming from the Heart!

991
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,440
That's the fun!

992
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:08,160
One more. We'll give one more.

993
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:11,000
We have got one more.

994
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:22,600
One more. Yes, she is there.

995
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:36,160
Two more are there? Two more? Two more of these.

996
02:53:37,360 --> 02:53:40,000
Two, bring two more.

997
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:45,040
Two others, two virgins were here in the beginning:

998
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:50,120
Barbara and the other girl.

999
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:02,600
That's it. Both of you, yes.

1000
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:11,560
They are in a special day of the virgins and the children ...

1001
02:54:24,040 --> 02:54:26,400
may God bless you.

1002
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:31,120
Now, where is Barbara gone?

1003
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,360
Genevieve never married?

1004
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:50,320
Genevieve and Madeleine. They are virgins too.

1005
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:53,280
They never married.

1006
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:56,680
Madeleine was married?

1007
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:03,120
You were married?

1008
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:15,520
... Another virgin ...

1009
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:23,680
And you can - how many more now, Gregoire?

1010
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:26,280
Four? All right. Three more, all right.

1011
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:30,000
Keep it now, we'll see about it.

1012
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:38,520
Yogini: Mother, I am out of the ...?

1013
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:42,240
But still you are a virgin.

1014
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:44,160
Virgin is a virgin and she must be respected,

1015
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:47,480
whatever may be the age, all right?

1016
02:55:53,320 --> 02:55:54,440
She wants one.

1017
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:57,320
Now there are two boys, three boys left, is it?

1018
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,200
Let them give, let them have, the three boys.

1019
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:03,160
You see, they should not be left out.

1020
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:07,680
That solves the problem, you see!

1021
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:13,680
You should never make them unhappy.

1022
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:19,320
Come along now, you are exactly three, for the three boys!

1023
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,560
Come along the boys, where are they?

1024
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:25,680
That is their day today!

1025
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:28,240
All right, so may God bless you.

1026
02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:30,080
Look after this plant, all right?

1027
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:33,000
Now where are the others? Other two boys.

1028
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:39,000
Now there's one Matthew that -

1029
02:56:39,240 --> 02:56:41,440
Matthew never came for the puja?

1030
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:46,120
Here. But he didn't come at the time of washing.

1031
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:48,680
He should have come, what was he doing?

1032
02:56:49,240 --> 02:56:52,400
Where were you, Matthew, at the time?

1033
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:54,240
But why didn't you come?

1034
02:56:54,520 --> 02:56:56,680
You are a boy, small little boy, all right?

1035
02:56:57,160 --> 02:56:59,320
Now this we can go to Wyson, Wyson you call it.

1036
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:02,480
He's all right, because ... can't look after the plant.

1037
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:16,600
You have to look after it immediately, I think.

1038
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:23,400
Where is he gone? Just call Wyson, that's all.

1039
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:44,280
Yogi: He's like a little angel!

1040
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:47,400
This one has the finest touch ...

1041
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,680
And how seriously he lifts his kundalini.

1042
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:58,400
You should see the way he lifts it and how he ties it,

1043
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:01,120
it's wonderful to see, you see, how he does it.

1044
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:03,480
The greatest thing!

1045
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:07,440
What about him now, he's going to be terrible now!

1046
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:15,680
Some flowers?

1047
02:58:17,160 --> 02:58:20,600
One rose? Or some flowers?

1048
02:58:21,320 --> 02:58:24,040
It's all right, it's all right, he forgets it.

1049
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:26,400
That's the beauty of the young people!

1050
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:28,680
What's the right thing?

1051
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:36,520
Camphor? Nothing, nothing serious. Nothing serious.

1052
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:38,360
Let him have something to eat.

1053
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:41,640
Now I have eaten something, now you can give to everybody

1054
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:43,680
now, because for the children specially,

1055
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:46,200
give it to children, the prasad.

1056
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:48,440

and here, only up to this you draw the line,

1103
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:43,560
and then fill it. All right?
