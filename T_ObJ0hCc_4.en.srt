00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,500
Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Eve of Birthday Puja

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,510
Sydney, Australia
March 20th, 1990

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,180
So My tour of Australia has come to an end.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,970
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well
done.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,150
We have had very good response; I didn’t
expect that much everywhere.

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:38,030
It was tremendous and very great things have
happened, some miracles also, during this

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,810
visit.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:50,740
And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have
to be with great potential manifesting.

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:58,660
If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise
I cannot work out.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,720
For that we have to understand that in Sahaja
Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,360
Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s
all the time blessings throughout.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,210
You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and
you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing

13
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,570
of the kind.

14
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,160
I have told you about how My father was in
jail, My mother was in jail and how many times,

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,090
and how we suffered during the war of independence.

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,380
We lost everything, all our properties, everything,
for the war of independence only.

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:43,000
But this is the independence, the freedom
of an absolute nature: not only for you but

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,320
for the whole world, for your children, for
everyone.

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,080
It’s a tremendous work.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,000
It’s a very great achievement.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,030
In the history of spirituality, in the history
of the world this is the greatest thing that

22
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,100
has happened, is that people are transformed
into a new awareness.

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,810
Perhaps you are not aware of it.

24
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,640
And we take it for granted, we don’t understand
the importance of it; and we get lost into

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,930
smaller, smaller things and very wasteful
things which are of no value.

26
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,060
How are these things will be going into the
history, you must understand that.

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,860
And where do you stand in that history?

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,730
What will you be called?

29
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,280
So now first of all there were problems with
the leaders.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,410
All right.

31
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,700
But there were some who stuck on to it.

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,600
They didn’t give it up.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,560
They did not give it up because the leaders
were bad.

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,930
Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck
on.

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:55,790
But those who went away, why didn’t they
write to Me why they went away?

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,640
This is an escape from reality.

37
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,150
This is an escape, to say that there was something
wrong with the the ashram people, there was

38
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,680
something wrong with the leaders – of course,
it was.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,710
But you should have written to Me – why
didn’t you write to Me?

40
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:21,100
Why did you take such decisions on your own,
and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch?

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,410
We have to be people of quality, otherwise
Sahaja Yoga won’t work out.

42
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,030
It’s not meant for people who are mediocres.

43
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,080
If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there
have to be people of quality, that is one

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,520
thing for sure.

45
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,570
Now I have seen that everywhere people have
taken here a view that it’s better to have

46
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,570
separate houses.

47
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,520
I mean, this is another absurd view: from
where it has come into your heads, I don’t

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
know.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most
asahaj view.

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,030
Today only I was reading, five old ladies
were killed by one man, because they were

51
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,540
living alone in every house.

52
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,350
Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere.

53
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,880
Even for security it’s better that you live
together, at least eight people, ten people

54
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,220
together.

55
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,370
There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no
sacrifice.

56
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,680
On the contrary if you live together as I’ve
told you, you save money, your children are

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,669
looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s
looked after, there’s somebody to look after

58
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,349
you.

59
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,159
But what is the gain of having another house,
I don’t understand.

60
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:51,590
You have to work much harder, pay much more,
but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there.

61
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,919
And then they develop problems, I have seen:
we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks,

62
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,499
we’ve got this, “my son has run away”,
that has happened, that has happened.

63
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:06,020
All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed
to be sort of responsible for everything.

64
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,220
It’s a complete liability, once somebody
comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability

65
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
on us.

66
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,460
But he has no responsibilities and he has
no duties – only I have.

67
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,589
That’s not proper.

68
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:27,789
So now I have to tell you today very frankly
that you all have to live together, at least

69
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,990
eight to ten people in a place.

70
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,419
And don’t fight, and don’t create groups.

71
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,699
Group-making is a very wrong thing.

72
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,419
Before making any group you write to Me.

73
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,110
You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll
attend to that letter if it is worth attending,

74
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,800
because I know everything through vibrations.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,860
Don’t talk against each other.

76
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,819
It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said
such people will go to hell.

77
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,919
It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will
be the hell here.

78
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,409
It’s hell here.

79
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,810
I have seen people suffering.

80
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,270
I have been so frightened, you have no idea.

81
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,039
Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all.

82
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,759
I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious
thing.

83
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,560
People have got heart attacks, have got accidents,
have got cancers, all kinds of things, and

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,089
really I am quite frightened that you people
don’t realize that there is another force

85
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,639
working it out.

86
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,379
Don’t take arbitrary decisions.

87
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:36,119
You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:40,150
Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy
in Sahaja Yog.

89
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,240
Everything is there available for you.

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,740
And you don’t have to do anything else except
that keep together: it’s a collective happening.

91
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,750
It’s a collective.

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:59,300
If you are not in the collective, the Divine
is not interested in you at all – you are

93
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,389
out of it.

94
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:09,449
Only the collective gets the power, only the
collective is magnetic.

95
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,789
Single person who lives away from collective
all the time, is something wrong with that

96
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,789
person.

97
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,740
If you cannot be collective, there’s something
wrong.

98
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,819
Such a person should sit down and find out
what’s wrong with that person, must get

99
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,719
it corrected, absolutely corrected.

100
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,610
And see to it that you are all right; because
this is for your benevolence.

101
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:39,060
You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life,
then be sensible, have some wisdom about it.

102
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,979
And so some people who have been negative
are still negative, and just thinking on the

103
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,839
same lines.

104
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:53,110
So it’s high time all of you have to work
it out sensibly, and understanding.

105
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:04,139
There are leaders because I have to have communication,
that’s all.

106
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,009
And they will communicate to Me about you
people.

107
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,180
If there are problems, they will try to solve
you.

108
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,539
If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to
Me and I’ll have to see to it.

109
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:19,569
There’s not going to be any regimentation
in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love.

110
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,150
But you must have love for yourself.

111
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,939
I mean, you should be self-disciplined.

112
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,919
Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come
here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times

113
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,520
I have been here, and when I come here what
I find, everything is broken down.

114
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,640
It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.

115
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,269
But next time I am going to see you all settled
down in proper ashrams, in different place.

116
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,800
Not for your own comfort you should think,
but if you have an ashram you put a center

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
there.

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,220
Every place you can have a center.

119
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,120
In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen
or twenty-one centers, in Bombay.

120
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,790
That’s how it increases, and improves it.

121
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,490
You have centers everywhere, so it’s available
to people all the time.

122
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,430
You would talk about it, meet every day, evening
time you all can meet, talk to each other;

123
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,279
and you have one day in a week somewhere,
in a school or something, big place where

124
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,699
you all meet.

125
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,839
The more you meet, the more there is rapport,
the more there is collectivity, the more there

126
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,449
are blessings for each one of you, and for
all of you.

127
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:29,730
It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst
when there is no collectivity – no.

128
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,700
When there is collectivity, everything works
out.

129
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,650
Everything is available to you.

130
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,589
So don’t try to break the collectivity by
forming any groups or anything – nothing

131
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,850
of the kind.

132
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,700
If you find anything wrong you have to write
to Me.

133
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,110
But it’s everybody’s responsibility is
to sustain the collectivity, to support it,

134
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,779
to help it.

135
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,490
If you find that somebody is talking about
somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he

136
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,550
was talking very good about you.

137
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,870
Why are you talking ill about that person?”

138
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,990
This is what, this is what Christ has said,
that these are peacemakers.

139
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,350
But somebody says something about someone
– oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that

140
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,400
one is like this,” then another one.

141
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,589
We are not like common people, we are not
ordinary people, we are saints.

142
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:35,800
We are to respect each other, to love each
other, to understand and enjoy each other.

143
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,149
What will the children say tomorrow?

144
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,000
So nobody should get away with this idea that
we can have separate houses, live separately

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,660
and we are all right.

146
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,470
Better take out all My photographs from them;
they have no business.

147
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,630
At least eight persons should be there in
one household, at least, minimum.

148
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,839
Eight to ten people is a good idea.

149
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,300
There’s no safety, there’s no progress,
there’s nothing in such houses where they

150
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
live alone very nicely.

151
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,350
Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car,

152
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,899
locking the house – what else are they doing?

153
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,500
It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely
boring.

154
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,740
Now I have already told you very clearly that
we have to live together.

155
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,470
And let the children know each other, know
everyone, they should know about their friendship.

156
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,250
And you know, it is so nice the way they love
each other and the way they talk to each other,

157
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,230
and about their aunties and uncles they talk
so sweetly.

158
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,290
So many aunties and uncles to have is something
so remarkable; to have so many nephews and

159
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,779
nieces all over.

160
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,509
And unless and until you have that kind of
a feeling, it won’t work out.

161
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,959
Then if somebody finds something wrong with
your child and tells you, don’t get angry

162
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,629
for that – thank him.

163
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:00,629
Try to improve your child.

164
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,850
The improvement of your child is for the benevolence
of the child.

165
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,850
Not to feel bad: “this is my child.”

166
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,230
This “my” business has to go a little
bit; then I will come.

167
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:14,280
If there is “my house”, “my children”,
“my car”, “my” this, this has to go

168
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,560
away.

169
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:29,089
Let us see how we start diverting our energies
to a collective beauty, collective love, collective

170
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,730
understanding.

171
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,520
And if it is not, there’s something wrong
with you, take it from Me, something wrong.

172
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,399
So either you are right-sided or left-sided:
find out and just get yourself cleared out.

173
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,960
Treat it out yourself, and you will understand
that there was something wrong with you, nothing

174
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,319
wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:59,010
All such ideas are going to completely blast
Sahaja Yoga and finish it off.

176
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:07,259
They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely
out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.

177
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:14,149
You can have one room each other, for each
one of them and you can stay together, and

178
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,209
you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever
you want.

179
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,209
If you want we can do rotation of leaders
later on if you like that, can be done also.

180
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,720
But still I would say that unless and until
there is something wrong with the leader,

181
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,709
it’s not proper to remove such a leader.

182
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,000
But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind,
but we have to have someone who is looking

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,560
after you, and informing Me about it.

184
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,690
But the wife of the leader is never a leader,
understand that, it’s only the leader is

185
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,690
the leader.

186
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,550
Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a
leader is not a leader, and she should never

187
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,980
behave like that.

188
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:00,300
She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all
the time looking after all the people in a

189
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,569
more gentler way than the husband himself.

190
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,029
That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader.

191
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:17,440
We have some, we have such women, and wherever
there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga

192
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
has prospered.

193
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,879
It has gone up to the governments, it has
gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone

194
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,490
up to such areas where we would never expect
it, anywhere there has been.

195
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:41,350
And most of the people now are in the ashrams,
in the whole world.

196
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,620
I hope you all understand the importance of
it.

197
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,920
Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately
the telephone comes, that something has gone

198
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,490
wrong with such and such person is sick.

199
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,149
Then I can tell you what is to be done, how
to get that person cured.

200
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,379
But supposing you are in some other house
…. It happened like this, one fellow was

201
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,959
like that and he met with an accident.

202
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,490
Met with an accident, nobody knew.

203
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,740
He was lying in the hospital – when he came
to his consciousness he called for somebody,

204
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,999
then they told Me.

205
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:23,709
It’s like one family, it’s like one body.

206
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,110
If something hurts here, every – the whole
body knows.

207
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,310
You must know how many there are with us.

208
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,480
You feel so strong and happy.

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,029
But first of all you must develop that rapport,
you must develop that love, must develop that

210
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,199
personality.

211
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,990
Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already
told them what treatment they have to take,

212
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,889
and take it seriously.

213
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,540
Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow
at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous.

214
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,420
All these horrible diseases that you have
heard of, all of them, one and all – say

215
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:04,519
epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say
cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis,

216
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:12,029
then there are other diseases like AIDS, all
that – attack only left-sided people.

217
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,010
Anybody who has left side, immediately try
to get rid of that left side.

218
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,990
The right side shows so everybody knows, and
you can throw away such a person, or you can

219
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,990
correct it.

220
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,089
But the left side be very careful, don’t
play about with the left side.

221
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,620
Left side is very dangerous.

222
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,509
To avoid that, don’t mix up with people
who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the

223
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:42,160
hospitals where such people live, don’t
try to cure people who are left-sided – they

224
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,470
can be all cured on My photograph.

225
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:52,709
And if somebody starts telling too much about
their woes and all that, just shut your ears.

226
00:16:52,709 --> 00:17:01,240
All this left side comes from a kind of a
self-indulgence, in the sense that you start

227
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,800
thinking you are so miserable, you are so
unhappy, you are no good, and all that.

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,490
So the right-sided are over-confident, the
left-sided are diffident.

229
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,790
But they’re, because they’re diffident,
you see, all kinds of viruses can attack.

230
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,740
And these viruses are the thing which bring
forth diseases which cannot be cured.

231
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,750
So be careful on that point.

232
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,930
The right-sided people trouble others.

233
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,280
The left-sided trouble themselves, and the
right-sided trouble others.

234
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,200
They try to show off, they want to – just
think they’re too much.

235
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,520
First sign of a right-sided is that he starts
suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also,

236
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,810
that’s another one.

237
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:53,350
Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s
a very big, great Sahaja yogi.

238
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,560
There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is just the same.

239
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,600
Just like all fingers are the same, every
cell is the same, everybody is the same.

240
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,440
So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,530
Everybody must understand that we are all
one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t

242
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,100
have to consider ourself higher or lower.

243
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,380
So there are so many ways of expression of
these boastful, right-sided people.

244
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,810
And we can pull their legs – all right,
allowed!

245
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,010
If somebody boasts too much you just pull
their legs, that’s allowed.

246
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,490
That’s how in India nobody can have ego,
because from very childhood if somebody tries

247
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,570
to show off, pull their legs.

248
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,710
If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs.

249
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,080
If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs.

250
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:00,650
I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo,
just pull their legs.

251
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:06,200
So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi
to be like that.

252
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,930
Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise
why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we

253
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,000
are just like them?

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,160
We have to be exceptional, isn’t it?

255
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:34,510
And that’s what is what I call dignified,
loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s

256
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,130
what is the beauty.

257
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:47,580
So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry,
full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and

258
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,250
just prick it – allowed!

259
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,090
And if he says anything, it’s to prick your
ego.

260
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,900
Show the pins, you see, like this.

261
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:08,620
He’ll understand, “All right, this is
what I have.”

262
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:15,910
So when you make a fun of a person who is
egoist he may not like it; but you show him

263
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,340
a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have
got it!”

264
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,840
They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t
want to have it.

265
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,830
There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son
wrote to Me saying that “My father says

266
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,720
that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and
he’s feeling very sad about it.”

267
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,040
So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed
to speak.

268
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:48,630
After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative
mood, and go home.

269
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,120
Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what
cake I am going to have?” – all rush to

270
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
the kitchen.

271
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,500
So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised
at it.

272
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,420
India, people don’t get so much to eat,
but they are not hankering so much after food.

273
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,410
Here the first attention is in the kitchen,
all the time they are in the kitchen.

274
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,520
How many times you take your tea is important.

275
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,380
You should count how many times you are in
the kitchen.

276
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,650
I mean, you are still little babies, I tell
you, in that respect.

277
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,630
I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge
to take out even water for Myself – I mean,

278
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:29,600
since I remember My life, never.

279
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,250
So this hankering after food is also another
funny thing that is.

280
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,190
After meditation people just get up and go
to eat.

281
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,710
You must sit down, meditate.

282
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,740
Now after meditation if people start giving
speeches, then the people are anxious to go

283
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:54,450
to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures,
so big problem starts between the two.

284
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,260
They don’t like it, because they think,
“Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something

285
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,790
biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman
is trying to give us a lecture.”

286
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,350
No one likes it.

287
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,000
But it should be something very different,
that we are in meditative mood, how can we

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,300
come out of it?

289
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,930
So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka,
which is very important.

290
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,320
He was the one, in the beginning at the time
of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of

291
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,549
Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka.

292
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,230
And He was a king.

293
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,760
So all the saints used to come and bow to
Him.

294
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,140
And He was a king, He used to live like a
king.

295
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,210
So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he
said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja?

296
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,310
He has got all the wealth, He has got everything,
wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and

297
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,310
show.

298
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,020
Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow
to Him?”

299
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,380
He said “He’s videhi.

300
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,090
He’s so detached, He’s videhi.

301
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,140
He doesn’t exist in His body.”

302
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,170
He couldn’t understand.

303
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,230
He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.”

304
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,460
So he went and told Him that “I want to
become self-realized, as You are.”

305
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,750
He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give
you, but no self-realization.”

306
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,640
“All right, we’ll see about it,” he
said.

307
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,300
So one day they were having a bath.

308
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,930
He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll
have our bath.”

309
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:22,270
So He took this boy, they were sitting and
having the bath, when some people came and

310
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:29,640
told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody
is running away.”

311
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,750
So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t
listen.

312
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,240
Then they came back again, shouted, “See
now, Your wife and children all are, have

313
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,730
come out of it and they are all running away,
because the whole thing is getting burned.”

314
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,310
Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.

315
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:54,980
Then they said, “Now the fire is coming
this side, and what are You doing?”

316
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,220
So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of
his clothes.

317
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,400
He thought, “I should wear my clothes at
least, they’ll be burnt.”

318
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,650
He was still meditating.

319
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,190
Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi.

320
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,580
That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi,
because She is the daughter of a videhi.

321
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,360
And that’s what we have to be.

322
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,690
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

323
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,270
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

324
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,390
That’s a meditative mood.

325
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,380
Keep yourself there.

326
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,950
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

327
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,361
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate, if that is so, if

328
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:38,920
you think that is proper.

329
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:50,350
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you, into that new

330
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,740
jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga:
if you have to catch that train, then you

331
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,700
hurry up.

332
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,000
You have to change all these ideas.

333
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,110
You have had many houses, you have had many
wives and many children in your previous life.

334
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,130
You never had your realization – now you
have got it.

335
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:14,910
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others, think of yourself,

336
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:21,170
“I have to do it, I have to get it, I have
to work it out.”

337
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,290
This is what you have to do.

338
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,130
“Why should I miss it?”

339
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,720
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

340
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,110
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

341
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:44,970
We had lots of people in Australia, and if
they had worried about themselves as to “what

342
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,630
I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

343
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,790
So in the morning you just decide, what I
am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

344
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:56,080
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

345
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,110
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

346
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,110
Every day.

347
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,300
You start a diary to write it down.

348
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,590
You face yourself.

349
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,890
No excuses, nothing.

350
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,330
If you are left behind, what we can do?

351
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,610
We can’t help it.

352
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,230
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

353
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,350
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

354
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:33,200
All your problems can be solved if you really
surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

355
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,640
Everything can be done.

356
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,620
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till

357
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,800
then it won’t work out.

358
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,510
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.

359
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,020
And I am sure that can work out.

360
00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:01,860
And you are basically a very good point here,
because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha.

361
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,660
Basically it’s such an advantage for you,
much more than Russians have.

362
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,340
But Russians, I don’t know how, they have
shot up so well.

363
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,230
It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where
they have denied Christ, they have denied

364
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:25,480
all religions, everything, and still they’re
prospering.

365
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,090
So you are very well placed.

366
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,890
And innocence can never be lost, can never
be lost, whatever you may try.

367
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:42,910
Of course, there could be clouds, but they
get just into nothing, they just disappear.

368
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:50,570
If you just try to clean off your innocence
and simplicity.

369
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,501
And don’t think too much, “We should do
like this, we should organize like this, we

370
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,630
should have this thing” – nothing of the
kind.

371
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,860
Wherever you are, why to think?

372
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,870
I never think, “Where I will sit?

373
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,220
What will be My chair?

374
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,250
How will I sleep?

375
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,850
How will I go there?”

376
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,850
Nothing.

377
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,360
Just exist.

378
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
Just exist.

379
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,280
Everything works out for good, you should
know.

380
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,920
Now, if you redden too much on your faces,
you should know you have left Vishuddhis.

381
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,510
So first of all know that you are forgiven
for everything.

382
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,890
Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just
remember.

383
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,270
You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred
percent.

384
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,610
There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing
to feel guilty.

385
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:37,830
And you are loved, you’re looked after,
you’re cared for.

386
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:44,480
Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring
government, I should say.

387
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,040
It cares for you, looks after you, it manages
so many things.

388
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,360
Unbelievable, it is.

389
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
It manages, it works out.

390
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,720
You must have heard about the story about
Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have

391
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
you heard?

392
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
No?

393
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
So … Kay.

394
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,010
Where is Kay?

395
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:18,170
I was – Kay, can you tell them?

396
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:31,180
Please come here.

397
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:39,850
Just come.

398
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:52,860
It’s too much!

399
00:29:52,860 --> 00:30:03,480
[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji
to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity

400
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,160
of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier
Reef.]

401
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,280
Just we decided spontaneously.

402
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,630
[Kay: Very spontaneously!

403
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,900
We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the
Brisbane people for a few hours, just to keep

404
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,910
Her a little more time with us; but we thought
it was important that She put Her attention

405
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:28,460
on the reef, because there was a lot of problems
happening with this great natural phenomena

406
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,090
off the coast of Cairns.

407
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,120
And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and
Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into

408
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,730
a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef.

409
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,470
And just looking at it, all the fish came
around.

410
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,320
It was just a miracle to be in the reef with
Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful

411
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,250
natural phenomena.

412
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,150
But within the next day the attention of the
people who had been researching the reef and

413
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,590
been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly

414
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,970
they started to realize the reef was regenerating.

415
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,240
And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were
dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t

416
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,600
know where they’d come from, and now they
don’t know where they’ve gone!]

417
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,990
They have written, it’s a mystery!

418
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,780
[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery.

419
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,130
But just a glance from our Mother has just
made everything right.

420
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,790
Jai Shri Mataji!]

421
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:40,480
But you are not a coral reef, you see, you
are not that; because you see, I cannot, I

422
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,280
cannot transform you that way.

423
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,690
You have to use your will power.

424
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:50,160
They are all animals, you see, and animals
are under the control of God, that’s why

425
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,470
they are called as “pashu”.

426
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,020
This “pash” means all the bandhan.

427
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,330
Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God
wants can do with them, with the, all the

428
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,940
plants, of animals, everyone.

429
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,230
But with human beings you can’t do everything.

430
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,830
And also to understand human beings is another
problem.

431
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,970
I don’t know how suddenly they become so
funny.

432
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,690
They are all right, going straight, and suddenly
you don’t know what happens to them.

433
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:29,340
So it’s a thing that God has created, and
then adding to that, man has created himself

434
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,000
a little bit more – which is quite a difficult
thing to understand.

435
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,691
So you better understand yourself, why you
do like that; and you have to with your free

436
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,990
will accept that “I have to do it.”

437
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,960
It is self disciplining and you’ll work
it out, and I’m sure one day you will show

438
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,850
that in Australia we have really achieved
a great height.

439
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,350
Children are wonderful here, no doubt.

440
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:05,660
Then another thing is that we have started
a school in India, with the idea that the

441
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:12,330
amount you pay only for their food and clothes
per month, that much is about to be charged

442
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,200
for them.

443
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,800
And they’ll have the best education of a
private school, with all other facilities

444
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,950
like horse-riding, swimming and every sort
of thing.

445
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,370
Music, dancing, everything can be taught to
them.

446
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,800
And the amount will be the same, practically
as much as you’ll be spending on one child

447
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,460
per month here, only for keeping them in the
house.

448
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,450
So it would be like going to a general school.

449
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,550
Of course, the transport and everything we’ll
look after.

450
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:48,850
Now for this we have – as it is, you have
paid some money, and others have also paid

451
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,780
– and we have made a good arrangement now.

452
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,850
The school has started.

453
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,621
With this kind of a school, the parents can
go and see their children for a month, two

454
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,660
months, whichever way you like, and stay there
with them.

455
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:07,210
Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas,
whichever way you want to do.

456
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,659
But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking
the children should not be exposed to this

457
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:17,520
funny type of a country where they are just
trying to destroy them, because we have tried

458
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
that also.

459
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,160
When the children go back to parents, they
come back with great problems, so it’s difficult.

460
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,550
So now to think “they are my children”
– if you really think they are your children,

461
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,960
for their benevolence you must sacrifice.

462
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,490
Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice,
but more this feeling that “they are my

463
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,490
children.”

464
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,169
They’re actually Mine.

465
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:45,530
And this will really help you a lot.

466
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,700
You will be free here to do what you like,
you have more time for meditation, spreading

467
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,090
Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort
of a warpath.

468
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:02,970
And we have to make these children so good
that wherever they go they will not take to

469
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,510
drugs, they will not take to bad things.

470
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,370
On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja
yogis.

471
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,220
Maybe we might start a university later.

472
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,990
But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed.

473
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,300
So now we have started for only, I think,
seven-year-old children a school now near

474
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,020
Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring
it down.

475
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,100
But now after three years or so we’ll be
starting school for all classes.

476
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,210
For all classes we’ll be starting in a big
way, and we’ll be having best teachers and

477
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,020
best timings, and we’ll look after them.

478
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,430
Only thing is that if the Cambridge University
accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University

479
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,590
affiliation, because Indian standards are
too high, very high.

480
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,860
They have to work really very hard for that.

481
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,120
I would prefer Cambridge better.

482
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,290
So they might agree to do that for us.

483
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:55,940
That’s how our children can achieve a better
understanding of things, and they have more

484
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,630
time for other things to do.

485
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,930
So, so many things we are going to combine
there.

486
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,310
Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to
introduce into that, where children know so

487
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:12,650
much about the trees, about the plants, about
animals, about fishes, about the surroundings

488
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,730
in which they live, about the Mother Earth,
about ecological problems and things like

489
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,730
that.

490
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,850
And we have to create really great leaders
out of them.

491
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:24,500
So it is for you to decide now the children
that you want to send there.

492
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,410
You can have children up to seven years here,
or six years here for your primary classes,

493
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,150
but not for your high schools.

494
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,840
But primary classes also we have.

495
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,840
If you want to send your children for primary
classes we have that also, that we can look

496
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,010
after those children who are for primary classes.

497
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,970
And there will be leave for the children for
two months or three months, I think, for which

498
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,100
you can come there, or you can take them anywhere
you feel like.

499
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,900
But I would not advise you to bring them back
here because it’s too much of an exposure,

500
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,290
and you know what’s happening to your children.

501
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:02,000
They’ll have to learn how to respect parents,
respect everything; and to get the intrinsic

502
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,600
value of everything properly evaluated in
their minds, so that they do not become stupid.

503
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,730
I’m sure this will work out very well.

504
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:22,710
I have seen some children in Rome: they have
become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.

505
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,740
So money-wise also we might have to cut down
little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter;

506
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,910
for your children you have to do something.

507
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,761
That’s the minimum they have worked it out.

508
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:38,180
They said that per month it will be about
three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive

509
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,090
of clothes, food, transport, everything, books,
everything.

510
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,650
You don’t have to worry for their expenses
at all.

511
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:52,370
You could give them some other clothes, but
they’ll have all their uniforms done by

512
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:58,850
them, books, shoes, everything will be done
in that amount, and education of every kind.

513
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,350
All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the
aptitude of the child.

514
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,060
And you’ll see, they will be something very
unique children.

515
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,480
So think it over.

516
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,730
And in that there is a lot of work entailed,
and some people are working it out.

517
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,900
I’ll be getting some people from here also.

518
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:28,170
And the whole process will be under My control,
so you don’t have to worry.

519
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:48,810
So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year
again.

520
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,300
But for next year – I mean of course, not
this year – but next year we have decided

521
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,200
that it would be better to come here in the
month of April or May; because May is a better

522
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,000
month here than March, and April is quite
hot.

523
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,190
So what do you say, April or May?

524
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,190
May.

525
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,190
May, all right.

526
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:15,900
But May, I can only come of fifth of May.

527
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:28,030
After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll
have one Sahasrara Day there and one here.

528
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:34,760
And we can work it out that way to come by
May, so we can have one month of May spent

529
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
here.

530
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I would like to spend more time.

531
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:42,600
But you must not have any more groups, quarrels,
fighting, problems with husband and wife.

532
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,800
I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them
to create these problems?

533
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,840
They were all right without marriages!

534
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,310
So all these petty things should not be there.

535
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,770
You should all be big, great people.

536
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,850
I would like to come and see you here in your
ashrams and things; I would like to know what

537
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,660
you have been doing, what creative work you
have been doing.

538
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,630
It’s beautiful things you can do.

539
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,630
All right?

540
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,210
So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this
Birthday Puja.

541
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,369
And everybody is quite jealous of you that
I’m having My birthday here!

542
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:34,850
I love you Australians very much, and you
have to also love yourself and have proper

543
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,230
value about yourself.

544
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:43,670
Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste
them on nonsensical things, that’s very

545
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,670
precious.

546
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,730
If you were not precious, you would not have
come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that.

547
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,430
You would have been by now in some pub!

548
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,390
All right.

549
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,800
Now, so few things we have here.

550
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:09,070
Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi]
Come along.

551
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,930
This ….

552
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:33,070
You see, they told Me not to bring anything,
and because there is Customs, I think that

553
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:40,160
the Customs torture My life for nothing at
all.

554
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,330
There are Customs, this thing, that thing.

555
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:48,750
So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could
manage to bring some things for you.

556
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:55,390
And I could only buy something in the duty-free
shop for you.

557
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,990
[Hindi]

558
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:16,360
So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi]
… One for Stephen.

559
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:37,310
These fountain pens are given to the leaders
so that they should write a letter to Me!

560
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:52,130
Brian, Mr Brian.

561
00:42:52,130 --> 00:43:22,380
Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right,
I don’t read it.

562
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:34,770
It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s
all right.

563
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,890
So this is Perth.

564
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:45,970
[Hindi] Brisbane.

565
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:51,410
Brisbane is not here.

566
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:58,300
We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else?

567
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,290
Canberra is not here?

568
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,190
All right, keep it.

569
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,720
Who else?

570
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Adelaide.

571
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,070
For Adelaide, we should try still.

572
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:14,980
I think it will work out now, things are better.

573
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,360
Things are much better.

574
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:25,380
It will work out.

575
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:32,900
[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia
nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for

576
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,910
You to take back to India.]

577
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,790
With Me?

578
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:48,250
[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective,
for Your birthday.]

579
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,890
Ah, I don’t think I can.

580
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:58,820
But what you can do is to send them with these
people when they come.

581
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:06,720
They can be kept here waiting?

582
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:32,960
There’s somewhere here, and they can bring
it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all

583
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,960
right?

584
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,390
For the tour.

585
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,110
All right?

586
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,540
May God bless you.

587
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,260
Thank you.

588
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,970
All right.

589
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,970
[Hindi]

590
00:45:45,970 --> 00:46:03,010
So we start giving saris to ladies who looked
after Me ... Canberra.

591
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:16,510
So she’s not come as yet?

592
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:21,020
All right.

593
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:27,180
Lyn, is she here?

594
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:34,910
Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl?

595
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:43,360
… Sandya Sapate … Jo?

596
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:54,620
Jo from Perth … Kay.

597
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:03,060
Kay from Canberra.

598
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:32,170
Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders
of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams;

599
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:43,190
so you read the name.

600
00:47:43,190 --> 00:48:05,080
And now you all 

601
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:44,890
should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t
know!

602
00:48:44,890 --> 00:49:38,080
First do it, first you people do it, all right.

603
00:49:38,080 --> 00:50:29,100
Come along, Cairns, come along.

604
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:39,300
Select.

605
00:50:39,300 --> 00:51:09,910
Whichever fits you.

606
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:33,820
These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit
anyone … Good … All right, take any one.

607
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,860
Looks nice – beautiful!

608
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,880
All right ….

609
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,900
With embroidery!

610
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,950
... May God bless you.

611
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:49,000
Take whichever you like.

612
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,510
That’s a good one!

613
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:06,240
… Of course, Burwood.

614
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:26,750
What about the New Zealand people?

615
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:39,910
Auckland ... All right.

616
00:52:39,910 --> 00:53:04,320
That’s fine ... All right, take it up …

617
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,730
Oh, blue?

618
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:25,820
You like green … So Melbourne has no, because
– Melbourne has no ashram so far.

619
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,820
Yes.

620
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,340
So they have to have ashram.

621
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:47,480
This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from
the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has

622
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:59,580
been so kind to bring all these things through
your Customs.

623
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:18,630
So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow
is there’s puja.

624
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:28,140
If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock,
but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll

625
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,430
be ready here to come.

626
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:36,280
I’ll be ready, very ready to come there,
but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready.

627
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,380
So we have told everybody eleven o’clock
we are starting the puja.

628
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:46,250
But let’s see how you do it, because the
preparation takes so much time.

629
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,260
All right?

630
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,770
May God bless.

631
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,930
I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday;
I’m not supposed to give any presents on

632
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:57,930
My birthday!

633
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,770
(So finish it off now?)

634
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:08,870
Good night, everybody.

635
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:13,600
Sleep early!

636
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:25,440
Hello, hello, how are you?

637
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:32,780
[Child: My father’s here.]

638
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:37,760
Which one?

639
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:50,190
… Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh?

640
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:57,660
What’s your name?

641
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,140
[Shridhara.]

642
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:05,119
Shridhara, eh?

643
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,810
And you are really Shridhara!

644
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,040
He’s very good at acting!

645
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:19,520
All these children can be really trained up
so well, as they are born-realized.

646
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:30,410
So you will come to India to study?

647
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:34,490
To ride horses?

648
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,210
…. Yes, yes.

649
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:57,220
You don’t have to wear in India, there is
no need, but we can get you some hats also

650
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:02,660
… They’ll fit you all right.

651
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:15,610
They make hats for every size of head!

652
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:20,360
All right.

653
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:29,859
May God bless you.
