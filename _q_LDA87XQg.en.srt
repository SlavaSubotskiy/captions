1
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:15,025
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:22,365
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:26,745
We can say this is the worship

4
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:30,835
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:40,765
If you understand that all this,

6
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:47,795
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:55,245
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:59,375
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:04,585
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:13,135
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:20,445
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:28,635
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,405
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:38,945
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:43,005
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,425
by the primordial sound,

17
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:49,685
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:55,405
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:01:55,795 --> 00:02:00,225
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:07,705
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:15,405
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:22,165
and for His own expression,

23
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:25,685
for His own manifestation,

24
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:30,005
for His own reflection.

25
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:35,905
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:41,005
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:46,675
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:56,685
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:03,195
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:08,675
His desire to create.

31
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,415
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:18,055
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:22,085
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:28,275
The attention has its own joy

35
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:33,085
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,445
She created all the universes,

37
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:41,355
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:47,045
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:50,805
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:57,395
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,525
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:06,895
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,305
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:17,215
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:23,695
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,705
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:30,865
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:34,795
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:40,435
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,285
to see His character

51
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:48,255
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:54,855
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:04:55,055 --> 00:05:00,685
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:07,115
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:13,015
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:18,075
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:24,135
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:28,875
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:34,695
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:41,885
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:47,825
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,665
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:57,065
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:01,205
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,785
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:09,415
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:14,375
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,565
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,085
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:23,805
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:29,895
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:36,115
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:45,945
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,995
we do something, we can create.

75
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:56,495
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,075
leave alone anything else.

77
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:04,345
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:10,045
we can put together and create something,

79
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:19,625
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:24,705
any power.

81
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:27,945
We cannot create anything.

82
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:35,915
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:41,525
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:44,855
Still it is gold.

85
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:48,195
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:52,795
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:56,565
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:07:56,765 --> 00:08:01,485
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:04,565
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:11,305
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:15,125
basically you all are the same.

92
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:20,765
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:25,175
also you cry the same way.

94
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:29,045
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:33,905
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:40,035
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:44,895
by some common principle of life.

98
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:50,505
And the common principle of life that is bound us

99
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:57,555
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,465
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,915
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:07,255
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:16,535
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:20,015
But in the human form only

105
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:27,155
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:32,745
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:38,245
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:44,395
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:47,955
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:55,455
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:09:55,655 --> 00:10:00,635
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:07,765
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,915
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:15,925
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:19,095
who have got your realization.

116
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:23,515
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:30,655
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:34,435
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,325
and the enjoyment.

120
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:46,265
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:50,025
what should happen to you?

122
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:54,675
What should we feel?

123
00:10:54,875 --> 00:11:00,965
How do we then exist?

124
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:06,975
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,835
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,465
that you are not there,

127
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:16,595
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,765
Secondly what happens to you

129
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:23,685
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,645
Just the existence.

131
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,395
And that existence that you become,

132
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:34,955
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:40,575
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,615
also much before.

135
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:45,325
In every religion we have had people

136
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:49,995
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:55,345
For example, even you can say,

138
00:11:55,545 --> 00:12:02,515
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:09,585
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:12,255
and a khumba also,

141
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:15,335
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:22,135
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:26,945
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:32,085
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:37,655
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:43,295
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:46,125
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:51,531
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:58,405
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:03,415
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,905
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:13,285
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:20,555
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:23,865
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:30,175
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:35,465
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:40,905
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:44,025
Also it will tell you wherever you go, like,

159
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:48,755
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,325
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,905
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,515
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,675
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:05,065
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:09,305
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:11,415
I said, 'Now what to do, where to go,

167
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,505
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:16,075
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:18,645
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:23,895
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:29,805
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:33,835
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:37,945
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,615
So the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,725
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,095
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,425
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:59,445
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,195
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:06,695
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,995
and we have to respect it.

182
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,285
I've already told you many a times

183
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,375
about how human beings were formed

184
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:21,525
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:24,785
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:28,225
All this leads us to understand

187
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:33,075
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:39,625
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,535
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:46,675
where you have become yourself.

191
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,025
You know yourself.

192
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:53,275
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:15:53,475 --> 00:16:00,785
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:09,905
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:44,785
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:52,105
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:16:52,305 --> 00:17:01,985
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:08,475
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:12,405
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:16,105
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:24,085
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:33,875
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:38,805
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:44,935
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:49,475
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:54,185
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:58,305
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:03,125
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:08,085
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:12,175
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,035
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:20,525
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:26,195
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,575
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:37,515
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,965
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:49,515
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:57,275
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:03,235
that It is the One that has given you intelligence;

220
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,405
It is the One that has given you wisdom;

221
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,575
It is the One which has given you

222
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,755
whatever you have as you were singing that,

223
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:18,305
"Whatever we have is given by You."

224
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,015
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:27,665
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,565
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:36,525
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:44,395
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:53,365
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:57,975
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:04,705
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:08,765
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:14,635
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:18,275
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:21,325
It's such a relationship.

236
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:24,655
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:30,115
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:37,215
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:48,645
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:54,065
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:59,605
and over your development.

242
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:07,655
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:12,275
Now

244
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,005
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,935
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,535
you may.

247
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,675
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,975
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:36,445
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:42,875
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:47,005
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,795
because it has a reaction.

253
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:59,015
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:15,115
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:21,015
into the water automatically,

256
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:28,955
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:33,995
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:37,385
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:42,675
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:53,045
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:59,645
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:06,825
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:12,805
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:16,845
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:21,565
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:28,065
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:32,175
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:36,825
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,265
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:43,985
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,925
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,115
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,215
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:23:54,415 --> 00:24:01,085
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:06,645
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,085
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:14,065
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:18,445
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:24,405
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:29,205
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:32,965
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:38,725
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:43,885
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:46,425
how to make others feel it.

285
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,115
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:52,365
or something nonsensical.

287
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:56,345
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:24:56,545 --> 00:25:02,465
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:08,505
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,785
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:15,335
You're sure about this Power

292
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:19,715
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:22,855
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:29,235
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:35,045
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:44,575
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:48,015
She tells you the truth.

298
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:55,055
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:59,895
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:03,855
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:09,285
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,835
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,755
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:17,625
that you forgive that person,

305
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:22,415
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,435
you don't do anything.

307
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,115
That's the truth.

308
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:31,865
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:35,525
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:39,405
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:42,745
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:26:42,945 --> 00:26:47,585
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:52,495
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,865
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:59,005
It makes no difference.

316
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:02,065
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:06,305
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:10,735
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:15,555
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:19,155
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:22,765
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,795
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:30,695
So it's a play going on.

324
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:37,155
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:46,105
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:51,615
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:56,285
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:27:56,485 --> 00:28:00,395
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:08,125
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:16,965
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,095
When you have the enlightened faith

332
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:26,825
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:32,865
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:38,185
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:44,065
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:47,845
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:55,935
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,475
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:28:59,675 --> 00:29:03,245
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:10,855
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:17,045
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:20,105
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:24,025
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:29,765
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:34,065
this work could not have been done.

346
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:39,325
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:51,425
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:55,495
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:59,265
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:07,455
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:11,975
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:19,805
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:23,035
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:27,565
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:31,085
all of them are just the same.

356
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:40,455
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:44,535
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:48,185
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:53,275
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:59,325
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:04,095
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:11,265
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:16,785
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:22,015
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:29,125
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,995
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:38,005
and we have crossed the number what we call,

368
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:40,815
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,865
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:45,615
It doesn't matter.

371
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:53,485
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:57,665
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:31:57,865 --> 00:32:02,675
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:08,095
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:12,295
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,275
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,535
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:23,695
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,875
should not disturb you much

380
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:30,625
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:34,675
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:39,215
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:45,265
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,455
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:53,025
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:56,255
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:32:56,455 --> 00:33:00,175
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:04,245
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:08,685
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,625
That's human nature also.

391
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:14,465
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:18,195
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:21,975
So some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:26,635
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,775
It will all work out.

396
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:33,195
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:40,565
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,385
of this compassion?".

399
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:48,915
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:52,645
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:55,875
This compassion within you,

402
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,655
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:03,135
completely destroyed,

404
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:07,135
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:11,595
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:16,125
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:24,495
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:27,405
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:32,395
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:37,225
As you see, I would say,

411
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:42,725
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:45,275
the water rises.

413
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:51,545
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:55,525
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:34:55,725 --> 00:35:00,135
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:02,685
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:09,125
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:16,005
So at this juncture when we are all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:18,715
you all have got your realization

420
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:23,315
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:35:23,515 --> 00:35:26,915
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:31,105
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:35,145
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:40,735
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:45,105
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,385
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:50,095
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:54,695
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:58,075
That's what we have to understand

430
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:07,425
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,915
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:15,385
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:21,345
I should say,

434
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:27,205
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:30,455
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:35,705
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:41,865
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:46,935
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:50,445
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:59,785
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,015
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:06,535
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:12,385
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:18,895
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,575
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:26,345
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:32,835
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:38,135
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:43,255
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:47,445
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,575
I think, from Africa.

452
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:54,105
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,505
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:37:57,705 --> 00:38:00,935
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:07,795
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,335
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:14,245
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:17,165
who are not even seeking.

459
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:22,505
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:27,935
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:32,805
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:37,045
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:41,885
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:47,335
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:53,545
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:58,715
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:02,625
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:06,265
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,355
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:14,255
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:17,315
This you will not do.

472
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:24,545
You are the, really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:30,975
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:37,415
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:41,685
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:44,755
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,985
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:54,815
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:58,645
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,745
who don't have greed.

481
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,885
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:09,765
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:13,275
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:17,075
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:20,705
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:23,335
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:25,765
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:31,835
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:35,185
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:39,105
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:45,925
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,855
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,445
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:54,045
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,855
you will try to have more of it

496
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:02,865
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,975
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,915
women should work it out

499
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:13,475
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:18,025
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,225
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:24,315
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:29,775
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:34,475
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,435
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:40,315
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,515
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:41:43,715 --> 00:41:50,535
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,695
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,295
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:59,935
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:04,755
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:11,095
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,435
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:19,935
And as you are all married also,

516
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:25,145
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:32,075
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:34,395
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:38,485
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:42,525
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:46,175
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:49,925
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:53,155
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:42:53,355 --> 00:43:01,035
And if something

525
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:03,535
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:05,915
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:09,665
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:13,045
and the household and this and that,"

529
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:16,845
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:19,575
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:23,325
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:27,375
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:31,795
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:36,945
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:42,795
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:51,165
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:55,305
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:43:55,505 --> 00:43:58,345
You will never grudge.

539
00:43:58,545 --> 00:44:03,805
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:08,045
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,545
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:17,655
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:22,695
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:27,265
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,785
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:33,985
So the compassion has to become active.

547
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:37,245
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:39,725
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:44,705
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:49,675
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,935
but some of them have not been because I think

552
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:55,115
some of the women have been men

553
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:59,965
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:04,535
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:10,465
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,085
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:14,825
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:17,725
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:19,725
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,735
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:27,245
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:33,415
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,915
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:40,875
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:43,485
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:47,465
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:51,085
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:55,385
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:45:55,585 --> 00:46:00,625
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:04,895
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,995
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:13,495
how it has worked out.

573
00:46:13,695 --> 00:46:17,745
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:22,015
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:26,705
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:32,235
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,205
I can't understand

578
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:38,245
the one who has his Kundalini awakened fully,

579
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:45,125
who has felt the All Pervading Power of Love,

580
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:49,125
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:58,225
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:07,415
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:47:09,105 --> 00:47:12,825
It is to realize

584
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:21,275
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:25,515
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:32,055
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:35,525
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:38,405
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:42,285
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:46,285
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:47:46,485 --> 00:47:49,155
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:47:49,355 --> 00:47:53,895
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:59,365
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:05,465
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,035
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:13,485
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:17,325
For your own life, is very important

598
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:21,705
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:27,835
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:32,105
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:48:32,305 --> 00:48:36,435
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:40,875
Just think of it.

603
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:48,405
What you are surrendering is what is perverted,

604
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:54,715
whatever is destructive, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:48:54,915 --> 00:49:01,495
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,485
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:11,475
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:14,725
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:16,465
Impossible.

610
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:21,735
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:24,505
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:27,915
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:34,635
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:38,655
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:45,195
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:46,915
You can do it.

617
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:52,375
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:57,765
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:49:57,965 --> 00:50:02,395
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:05,635
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:12,655
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:18,435
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:21,685
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:25,595
it should also grow more in quality;

625
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:30,655
and as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:32,965
Because I know all the time

627
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:36,015
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:50:36,215 --> 00:50:39,495
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:50:39,695 --> 00:50:43,845
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:46,055
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:49,685
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:51,755
So forget about them.

633
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:58,685
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,045
They are your real relations.

635
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:05,155
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:09,055
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:51:09,255 --> 00:51:12,295
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:16,695
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:20,635
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:23,545
You should find out where are they.

641
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:26,455
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:31,435
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:33,045
Whatever you want,

644
00:51:33,245 --> 00:51:37,735
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:43,295
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:46,515
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:51:46,715 --> 00:51:52,255
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:59,615
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:06,385
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:52:07,105 --> 00:52:10,335
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:14,375
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:52:14,575 --> 00:52:18,565
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:21,815
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:52:22,025 --> 00:52:24,215
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:27,415
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,105
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:52:29,305 --> 00:52:32,605
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:38,875
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:42,035
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:46,965
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:51,965
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:54,645
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:52:54,845 --> 00:52:58,675
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,125
So, you have to worship.

665
00:53:00,325 --> 00:53:04,485
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:08,055
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:11,755
May God bless you.
