1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,080
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,420
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,800
We can say this is the worship

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,890
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:40,820
If you understand that all this,

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,850
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,300
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,430
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,640
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:13,190
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,500
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:28,690
So first of all He did was to create

13
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,460
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,000
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,060
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,480
by the primordial sound,

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,740
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,460
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,280
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,460
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,220
and for His own expression,

23
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,740
for His own manifestation,

24
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,060
for His own reflection.

25
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,960
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,060
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,730
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:56,740
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,250
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,730
His desire to create.

31
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,470
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word chitvilas.

32
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,110
Is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,140
Chit is, as you know is chitta, is attention.

34
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,330
The attention has its own joy

35
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,140
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,500
She created all the universes,

37
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,410
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,100
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,860
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,450
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,580
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,950
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,360
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,270
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,750
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,760
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,920
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,850
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,490
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,340
to see His character

51
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,310
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,910
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,740
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,170
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,070
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,130
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,190
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,930
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,750
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,940
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,880
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,720
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,120
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,260
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,840
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,470
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,430
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,620
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,140
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,860
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,950
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,170
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,000
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,050
we do something, we can create.

75
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,550
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,130
leave alone anything else.

77
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,400
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,100
we can put together and create something,

79
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:19,680
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,760
any power.

81
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,000
We cannot create anything.

82
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,970
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,580
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,910
Still it is gold.

85
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,250
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,850
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,620
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,540
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,620
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,360
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,180
basically you all are the same.

92
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,820
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,230
also you cry the same way.

94
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,100
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,960
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,090
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,950
by some common principle of life.

98
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,560
And the common principle of life that is bound us

99
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:57,610
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,520
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,970
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,310
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:16,590
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,070
But in the human form only

105
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,210
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,800
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,300
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,450
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,010
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:55,510
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,690
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,820
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,970
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,980
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,150
who have got your realization.

116
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,570
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,710
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,490
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,380
and the enjoyment.

120
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:46,320
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,080
what should happen to you?

122
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,730
What should we feel?

123
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,020
How do we then exist?

124
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,030
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,890
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,520
that you are not there,

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,650
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,820
Secondly what happens to you

129
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,740
is that become just the existence.

130
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,700
Just the existence.

131
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,450
And that existence that you become,

132
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,010
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,630
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,670
also much before.

135
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,380
In every religion we have had people

136
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,050
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,400
For example, even you can say,

138
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,570
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,640
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,310
and a khumba also,

141
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,390
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:22,190
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,000
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,140
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,710
Also you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,350
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,180
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,380
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,460
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,470
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,960
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,340
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,610
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,920
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,230
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,520
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,960
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,080
Also it will tell you wherever you go, like,

159
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,810
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,380
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,960
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,570
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,730
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,120
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,360
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,470
I said, 'Now what to do, where to go,

167
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,560
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,130
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,700
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,950
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,860
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,890
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,000
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,670
So the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,780
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,150
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,480
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,500
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,250
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,750
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,050
and we have to respect it.

182
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,340
I've already told you many a times

183
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,430
about how human beings were formed

184
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,580
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,840
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,280
All this leads us to understand

187
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,130
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,680
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,590
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,730
where you have become yourself.

191
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,080
You know yourself.

192
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,330
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:00,840
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,960
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,840
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,160
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:02,040
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,530
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,460
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,160
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:24,140
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,930
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,860
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,990
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,530
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,240
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,360
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,180
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,140
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,230
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,090
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,580
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:26,250
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,630
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:37,570
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,020
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:49,570
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:57,330
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:03,290
that It is the One that has given you intelligence;

220
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,460
It is the One that has given you wisdom;

221
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,630
It is the One which has given you

222
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,810
whatever you have as you were singing that,

223
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,360
"Whatever we have is given by You."

224
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,070
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,720
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,620
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,580
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:44,450
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:53,420
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,030
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,760
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,820
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,690
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,330
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,380
It's such a relationship.

236
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,710
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:30,170
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:37,270
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:48,700
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,120
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,660
and over your development.

242
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,710
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,330
Now

244
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,060
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,990
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,590
you may.

247
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,730
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,030
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,500
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,930
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,060
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,850
because it has a reaction.

253
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:59,070
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:15,170
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:21,070
into the water automatically,

256
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:29,010
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,050
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,440
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,730
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:53,100
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:59,700
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:06,880
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,860
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,900
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,620
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:28,120
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,230
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,880
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,320
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,040
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,980
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,170
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,270
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:01,140
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,700
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,140
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,120
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,500
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,460
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,260
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,020
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,780
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,940
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,480
how to make others feel it.

285
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,170
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,420
or something nonsensical.

287
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,400
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,520
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,560
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,840
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,390
You're sure about this Power

292
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,770
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,910
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,290
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,100
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:44,630
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,070
She tells you the truth.

298
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,110
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,950
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,910
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,340
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,890
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,810
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,680
that you forgive that person,

305
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,470
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,490
you don't do anything.

307
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,170
That's the truth.

308
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,920
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,580
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,460
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,800
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,640
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,550
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,920
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,060
It makes no difference.

316
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,120
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,360
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,790
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,610
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,210
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,820
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,850
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,750
So it's a play going on.

324
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:37,210
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:46,160
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,670
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,340
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,450
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:08,180
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:17,020
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,150
When you have the enlightened faith

332
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,880
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,920
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,240
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,120
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,900
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:55,990
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,530
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,300
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,910
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,100
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,160
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,080
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,820
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,120
this work could not have been done.

346
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:39,380
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:51,480
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,550
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,320
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:07,510
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,030
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:19,860
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,090
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,620
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,140
all of them are just the same.

356
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:40,510
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,590
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,240
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,330
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,380
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,150
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:11,320
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,840
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,070
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,180
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,050
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,060
and we have crossed the number what ...(indistinct)... had said,

368
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,870
or we can say what St. John has said,

369
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,920
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,670
It doesn't matter.

371
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:53,540
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,720
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,730
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,150
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,350
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,330
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,590
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,750
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,930
should not disturb you much

380
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,680
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,730
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,270
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:45,320
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,510
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,080
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,310
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,230
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,300
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,740
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,680
That's human nature also.

391
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,520
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,250
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,030
So some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,690
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,830
It will all work out.

396
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,250
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:40,620
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,440
of this compassion?".

399
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,970
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,700
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,930
This compassion within you,

402
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,710
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,190
completely destroyed,

404
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,190
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,650
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,180
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:24,550
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,460
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,450
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,280
As you see, I would say,

411
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,780
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,330
the water rises.

413
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,600
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,580
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,190
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,740
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:09,180
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:16,060
So at this juncture when we are all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,770
you all have got your realization

420
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,370
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,970
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,160
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthies,

423
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,200
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,790
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,160
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,440
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,150
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,750
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,130
That's what we have to understand

430
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:07,480
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,970
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,440
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,400
I should say,

434
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,260
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,510
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,760
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,920
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,990
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,500
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:59,840
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,070
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,590
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,440
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,950
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,630
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,400
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,890
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,190
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,310
So you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,500
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,630
I think, from Africa.

452
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,160
So I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,560
Also we have so many other areas

454
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,990
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:07,850
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,390
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,300
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,220
who are not even seeking.

459
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,990
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,860
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,100
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,940
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,390
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:53,600
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,770
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,680
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,320
because many people have seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,410
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:14,310
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,370
This you will not do.

472
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:24,600
You are the, really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,030
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:37,470
and this salt is going to dissolve many others

475
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,740
once we start spreading out like that.

476
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,810
I am not saying you should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,040
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,870
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,700
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,800
who don't have greed.

481
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,940
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,820
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,330
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,130
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,760
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,390
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,820
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,890
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,240
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,160
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,980
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,910
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,500
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,100
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,910
you will try to have more of it

496
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,920
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,030
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,970
women should work it out

499
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,530
because women have more sense of compassion -

500
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,080
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,370
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,830
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,530
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,490
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,370
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,570
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:50,590
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,750
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,350
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,990
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,810
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:11,150
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,490
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,990
And as you are all married also,

516
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:25,200
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:32,130
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,450
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,540
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,580
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,230
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,980
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,210
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:42:53,410 --> 00:43:01,090
And if something

525
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,590
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,970
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,720
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,100
and the household and this and that,"

529
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,900
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,630
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,380
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,430
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,850
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:37,000
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,850
Actually what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:51,220
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,360
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,400
You will never grudge.

539
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,860
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,100
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,600
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,710
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,750
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,320
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,840
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,040
So the compassion has to become active.

547
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,300
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,780
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,760
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,730
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,990
but some of them have not been because I think

552
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,170
some of the women have been men

553
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:00,020
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,590
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,520
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,140
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,880
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,780
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, can understand,

559
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,780
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,790
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,300
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,470
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,970
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,930
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,540
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,520
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,140
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,440
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,680
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,950
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:10,050
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,550
how it has worked out.

573
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,800
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,070
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,760
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,290
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,260
I can't understand

578
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,300
the one who has his Kundalini awakened fully,

579
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:45,180
who has felt the All Pervading Power of Love,

580
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,180
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:58,280
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:07,470
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,880
It is to realize

584
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:21,330
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,570
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:32,110
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,580
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,460
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,340
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,340
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,210
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,950
and I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,420
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere.

594
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:05,520
So at least that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,090
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,540
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,380
For your own life, is very important

598
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,760
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,890
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:32,160
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,490
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,930
Just think of it.

603
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:48,460
What you are surrendering is what is perverted,

604
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:54,770
whatever is destructive, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:48:54,970 --> 00:49:01,550
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:06,540
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,530
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,780
If you don't know yourself, how will you know God also?

609
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,520
Impossible.

610
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,790
So to know yourself you have to evolve.

611
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,560
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,970
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:34,690
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,710
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:45,250
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,970
You can do it.

617
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,430
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:57,820
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,450
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,690
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:12,710
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis, unbelievable,

622
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:18,490
but as it is growing sideways it should also grow upwards.

623
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,740
As it is growing in quantity

624
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,650
it should also grow more in quality;

625
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,710
and as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,020
Because I know all the time

627
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,070
you are so collective that you all the time you feel,

628
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,550
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,900
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,110
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,740
"My father still is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,810
So forget about them.

633
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:58,740
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,100
They are your real relations.

635
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,210
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,110
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,350
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,750
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,690
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:23,600
You should find out where are they.

641
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,510
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,490
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,100
Whatever you want,

644
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,790
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:43,350
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,570
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:52,310
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:59,670
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:06,440
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,390
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,430
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,620
So I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,870
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,270
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:27,470
I think if there's any puja that we should do, is this one,

656
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,160
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,660
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,930
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,090
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:47,020
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,020
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,700
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,730
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,180
So you have to worship

665
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,540
and is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,110
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,810
May God bless you.
