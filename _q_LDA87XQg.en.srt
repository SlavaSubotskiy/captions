1
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:13,837
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:21,177
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,557
We can say this is the worship

4
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:29,647
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:39,577
If you understand that all this,

6
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:46,607
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:54,057
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:58,187
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:03,397
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:11,947
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:19,257
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:27,447
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:31,217
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:37,757
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:41,817
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:44,237
by the primordial sound,

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,497
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:54,217
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:59,037
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:06,517
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:14,217
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:20,977
and for His own expression,

23
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:24,497
for His own manifestation,

24
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:28,817
for His own reflection.

25
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:34,717
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:39,817
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:45,487
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:55,497
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:02:55,697 --> 00:03:02,007
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:07,487
His desire to create.

31
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,227
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:16,867
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:20,897
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:27,087
The attention has its own joy

35
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:31,897
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:35,257
She created all the universes,

37
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:40,167
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:45,857
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,617
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:56,207
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:03:57,617 --> 00:04:00,337
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:05,707
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:09,117
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:16,027
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:22,507
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:25,517
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:29,677
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,607
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:39,247
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,097
to see His character

51
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:47,067
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:53,667
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:59,497
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:05,927
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:11,827
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:16,887
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:22,947
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:27,687
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:33,507
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:40,697
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:46,637
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:51,477
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:55,877
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:05:56,077 --> 00:06:00,017
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,597
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:08,227
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:13,187
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,377
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,897
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:22,617
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:28,707
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:34,927
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:44,757
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:48,807
we do something, we can create.

75
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:55,307
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,887
leave alone anything else.

77
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:03,157
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:08,857
we can put together and create something,

79
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:18,437
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:23,517
any power.

81
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:26,757
We cannot create anything.

82
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:34,727
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:40,337
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:43,667
Still it is gold.

85
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:47,007
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:51,607
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,377
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:07:55,577 --> 00:08:00,297
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:03,377
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:10,117
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:13,937
basically you all are the same.

92
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:19,577
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:23,987
also, you cry the same way.

94
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,857
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:32,717
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,847
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:43,707
by some common principle of life.

98
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:49,317
And the common principle of life that has bound us

99
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:56,367
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,277
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,727
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:06,067
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:15,347
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:18,827
But in the human form only

105
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:25,967
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:31,557
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:37,057
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:43,207
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:46,767
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:54,267
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:59,447
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:06,577
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,727
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:14,737
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,907
who have got your realization.

116
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:22,327
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:29,467
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,247
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,137
and the enjoyment.

120
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:45,077
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:48,837
what should happen to you?

122
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:53,487
What should we feel?

123
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:59,777
How do we then exist?

124
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:05,787
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:09,647
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:11,277
that you are not there,

127
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:15,407
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,577
Secondly, what happens to you

129
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:22,497
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,457
Just the existence.

131
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:28,207
And that existence that you become,

132
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:33,767
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:39,387
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,427
also much before.

135
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:44,137
In every religion we have had people

136
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:48,807
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:54,157
For example, even you can say,

138
00:11:54,357 --> 00:12:01,327
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:08,397
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:11,067
and a khumba also,

141
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:14,147
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:20,947
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:25,757
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:30,897
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:36,467
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:42,107
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,937
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:50,343
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:57,217
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:02,227
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:06,717
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:12,097
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:19,367
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,677
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:28,987
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:34,277
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:39,717
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,837
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

159
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:47,567
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:51,137
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:54,717
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,327
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,487
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:03,877
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:08,117
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:10,227
I said, 'Now what to do, where to - 

167
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,317
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,887
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,457
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:22,707
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:28,617
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:32,647
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:36,757
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:39,427
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:42,537
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,907
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:52,237
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:58,257
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:01,007
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:05,507
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,807
and we have to respect it.

182
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,097
I've already told you many a times

183
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:13,187
about how human beings were formed

184
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:20,337
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,597
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,037
All this leads us to understand

187
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:31,887
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:38,437
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,347
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:45,487
where you have become yourself.

191
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:47,837
You know yourself.

192
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:52,087
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:59,597
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:08,717
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:43,597
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:50,917
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:16:51,117 --> 00:17:00,797
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:07,287
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:11,217
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,917
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:22,897
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:32,687
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:37,617
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:43,747
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:48,287
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:52,997
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:57,117
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:01,937
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:06,897
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,987
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,847
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:19,337
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:25,007
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:28,387
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:36,327
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:39,777
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:48,327
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:56,087
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:18:56,287 --> 00:19:02,047
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

220
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:06,217
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

221
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,387
It is the One which has given you

222
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:12,567
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

223
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,117
"Whatever we have is given by You".

224
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:21,827
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:26,477
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:30,377
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:35,337
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:43,207
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:52,177
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,787
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:03,517
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:07,577
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:13,447
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:17,087
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:20,137
It's such a relationship.

236
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:23,467
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:28,927
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,027
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:47,457
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:52,877
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:58,417
and over your development.

242
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:06,467
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:11,087
Now

244
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:21,817
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:24,747
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:26,347
you may.

247
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,487
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,787
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:35,257
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:41,687
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,817
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:49,607
because it has a reaction.

253
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:57,827
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:13,927
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:19,827
into the water automatically,

256
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:27,767
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:32,807
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,197
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:41,487
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:51,857
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:58,457
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:05,637
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:11,617
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:15,657
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:20,377
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:26,877
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,987
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:35,637
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:38,077
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:42,797
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:45,737
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:49,927
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:53,027
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:59,897
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:05,457
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,897
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:12,877
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,257
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:23,217
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:28,017
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,777
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:37,537
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:42,697
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:45,237
how to make others feel it.

285
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:48,927
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,177
or something nonsensical.

287
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:55,157
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:24:55,357 --> 00:25:01,277
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:07,317
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:11,597
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,147
You're sure about this Power

292
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,527
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,667
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:28,047
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:33,857
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:43,387
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:46,827
She tells you the truth.

298
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:53,867
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:58,707
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:02,667
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:08,097
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:10,647
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,567
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,437
that you forgive that person,

305
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:21,227
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,247
you don't do anything.

307
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:25,927
That's the truth.

308
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:30,677
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:34,337
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:38,217
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:41,557
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:46,397
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:51,307
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:54,677
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:57,817
It makes no difference.

316
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,877
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:05,117
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:09,547
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:14,367
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,967
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,577
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:26,607
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:29,507
So, it's a play going on.

324
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:35,967
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:44,917
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:50,427
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:55,097
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:59,207
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:06,937
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:15,777
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:18,907
When you have the enlightened faith,

332
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:25,637
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:31,677
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:36,997
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:42,877
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:46,657
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:54,747
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:58,287
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:02,057
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:09,667
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:15,857
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:18,917
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:22,837
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:28,577
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:32,877
this work could not have been done.

346
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:38,137
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:50,237
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:54,307
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:58,077
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:06,267
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:10,787
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:18,617
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,847
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:26,377
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,897
all of them are just the same.

356
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:39,267
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:43,347
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:46,997
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:52,087
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:58,137
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:30:58,337 --> 00:31:02,907
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:31:03,107 --> 00:31:10,077
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:15,597
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:20,827
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:27,937
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:32,807
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:36,817
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible] 

368
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:39,627
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:42,677
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,427
It doesn't matter.

371
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:52,297
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:56,477
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:31:56,677 --> 00:32:01,487
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:06,907
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:11,107
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:14,087
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:18,347
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:22,507
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,687
should not disturb you much

380
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:29,437
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:33,487
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:38,027
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:44,077
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:48,267
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,837
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:55,067
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,987
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:03,057
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:07,497
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,437
That's human nature also.

391
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:13,277
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:17,007
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:20,787
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:25,447
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,587
It will all work out.

396
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:32,007
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:39,377
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:42,197
of this compassion?".

399
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:47,727
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:51,457
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:54,687
This compassion within you,

402
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:58,467
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,947
completely destroyed,

404
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:05,947
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:10,407
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:14,937
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:23,307
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:26,217
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:31,207
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,037
As you see, I would say,

411
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:41,537
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:44,087
the water rises.

413
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:50,357
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:54,337
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:58,947
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,497
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:07,937
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:14,817
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:17,527
you all have got your Realization

420
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:22,127
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:25,727
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:29,917
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:33,957
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:39,547
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:43,917
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,197
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:48,907
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:53,507
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:56,887
That's what we have to understand

430
00:35:57,117 --> 00:36:06,237
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:08,727
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:14,197
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:20,157
I should say,

434
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:26,017
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,267
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:34,517
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:40,677
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:45,747
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:49,257
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:58,597
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:01,827
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:05,347
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:11,197
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:17,707
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:20,387
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:25,157
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:31,647
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:36,947
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:42,067
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:46,257
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:48,387
I think, from Africa.

452
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:52,917
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,317
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:59,747
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:06,607
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:09,147
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:13,057
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,977
who are not even seeking.

459
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:21,317
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:26,747
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:31,617
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:35,857
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:40,697
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:46,147
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:52,357
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:57,527
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:38:57,737 --> 00:39:01,437
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:05,077
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,167
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:13,067
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,127
This you will not do.

472
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:23,357
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:29,787
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:39:29,987 --> 00:39:36,227
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:40,497
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,567
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:46,797
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:53,627
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:57,457
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:39:57,657 --> 00:39:59,557
who don't have greed.

481
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:02,697
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:08,577
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:40:08,777 --> 00:40:12,087
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:15,887
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:19,517
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,147
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,577
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:30,647
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,997
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:37,917
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:44,737
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,667
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,257
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:52,857
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:56,667
you will try to have more of it

496
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:01,677
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,787
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:06,727
women should work it out

499
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:12,287
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:16,837
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:20,037
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:23,127
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:28,587
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:33,287
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,247
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:39,127
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:42,327
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:49,347
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,507
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:55,107
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:58,747
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:03,567
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:09,907
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:14,247
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:18,747
And as you are all married also,

516
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:23,957
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:30,887
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,207
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,297
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:42:37,497 --> 00:42:41,337
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:44,987
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,737
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:51,967
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:59,847
And if something

525
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:02,347
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,727
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:08,477
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:43:08,677 --> 00:43:11,857
and the household and this and that".

529
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:15,657
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:18,387
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:22,137
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:26,187
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:30,607
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:35,757
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:41,607
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:49,977
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:54,117
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:43:54,317 --> 00:43:57,157
You will never grudge.

539
00:43:57,357 --> 00:44:02,617
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:06,857
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:10,357
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:16,467
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:21,507
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:44:21,707 --> 00:44:26,077
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,597
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:32,797
So, the compassion has to become active.

547
00:44:32,997 --> 00:44:36,057
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,537
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:43,517
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:48,487
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:51,747
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

552
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,927
some of the women have been men

553
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:58,777
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:03,347
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:09,277
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:10,897
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:45:11,097 --> 00:45:13,637
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:16,537
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,537
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,547
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:26,057
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:32,227
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:34,727
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:39,687
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:42,297
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:45:42,497 --> 00:45:46,277
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,897
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:54,197
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:45:54,397 --> 00:45:59,437
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:03,707
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:08,807
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:12,307
how it has worked out.

573
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:16,557
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:20,827
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:25,517
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:31,047
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,017
I can't understand

578
00:46:33,217 --> 00:46:37,057
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

579
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:43,937
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

580
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,937
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:57,037
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:46:57,237 --> 00:47:06,227
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:11,637
It is to realize

584
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:20,087
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:24,327
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:30,867
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:47:31,067 --> 00:47:34,337
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:37,217
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:41,097
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:45,097
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:47,967
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:52,707
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:58,177
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:04,277
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,847
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:12,297
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:16,137
For your own life, is very important

598
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:20,517
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:26,647
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:30,917
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:35,247
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:39,687
Just think of it.

603
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:47,217
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

604
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:53,527
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:48:53,727 --> 00:49:00,307
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:05,297
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:10,287
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:13,537
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:49:13,737 --> 00:49:15,277
Impossible.

610
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:20,547
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:23,317
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:26,727
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:33,447
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:37,467
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:44,007
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:45,727
You can do it.

617
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:51,187
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:49:51,387 --> 00:49:56,577
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:49:56,777 --> 00:50:01,207
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:04,447
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:11,467
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:17,247
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,497
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:24,407
it should also grow in quality.

625
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:29,467
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,777
Because I know all the time

627
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,827
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:38,307
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:50:38,507 --> 00:50:42,657
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:44,867
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:48,497
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:50,567
So forget about them.

633
00:50:50,777 --> 00:50:57,497
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,857
They are your real relations.

635
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,967
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,867
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:11,107
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:15,507
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:19,447
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:22,357
You should find out where are they.

641
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:25,267
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:30,247
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:31,857
Whatever you want,

644
00:51:32,057 --> 00:51:36,547
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:42,107
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:45,327
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:51:45,527 --> 00:51:51,067
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:58,427
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:05,197
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:09,147
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:13,187
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:17,377
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:20,627
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,027
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:26,227
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:27,917
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:52:28,117 --> 00:52:31,417
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:37,687
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:40,847
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:45,777
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:50,777
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:53,457
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:52:53,657 --> 00:52:57,487
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:58,937
So, you have to worship.

665
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:03,297
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:06,867
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:10,567
May God bless you.
