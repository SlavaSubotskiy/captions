1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Today is a sad day because such a great man
like Sadat is dead. He is not great to Me

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:18,650
because he was a great politician or he was
president, but he was a saint, he was a realized

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,650
soul, I knew all about him. The attack of
the negativity is on but no more they will

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,940
crucify a saint this way and will not face
the punishment. They will be punished now.

5
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:50,409
All those who tried to do such things will
be punished because the new age has started.

6
00:00:53,749 --> 00:01:00,749
Today I wanted to tell you about the Agya
chakra, about Jesus Christ who adorns this

7
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:12,269
center of Agya chakra, where you see the red
mark. Behind that, inside, in the brain on

8
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,869
the crossing of the optic chiasm is this subtle
center where this great Deity is placed through

9
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,149
His crucifixion and through His Resurrection.
He has created this space for us to enter

10
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:45,179
into the Kingdom of God, which is placed within
us. Is not in without, is the limbic area

11
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,320
that surrounds your ego and superego. In the
Puranas, in the ancient scriptures of India,

12
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,979
Christ is described so very clearly. Actually
in the Bible what they saw of Him when He

13
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:15,020
was on this Earth was written down. But nothing
what created Him, how He came on this Earth

14
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,140
what is the spirit of Christ, what is the
seat of Christ and how He came and what is

15
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,090
His purpose and where does He stand within
us. All these things are not described in

16
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,730
the Bible as I told you the people at that
time were not at all aware of His greatness,

17
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:39,730
of His special Incarnation. But if you read
some of these ancient books you’ll find

18
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,140
that He was called as Mahavishnu in the Devi
Purana, in the Goddess Purana, is the ancient

19
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,840
scripture of the Goddess. Mahavishnu was created
immaculately. Now when we say that Christ

20
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:17,890
always pointed out this pick is very significant.
Actually this, this means Vishuddhi chakra

21
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,840
and means also America. But this also means
Vishuddhi chakra stands for Shri Krishna as

22
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,120
I told you and He is the Primordial Being,
and He is the epitome of our evolution in

23
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,620
the sense that He is the Primordial Being
who is the Father, who is the preserver.

24
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Now in the Puranas He is described that His
power was Radha, Radha. Sanskrit language

25
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,440
is absolutely very scientific as far as the
Divine Laws are concerned. Ra means the energy,

26
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,310
dha means the one that sustains. [SANSKRIT
TALK] She is the one who sustains the energy

27
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:20,310
and She was His power. But in India Krishna
is never taken as Krishna Radha but Radha

28
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Krishna. The energy is before the deity. The
lady is before the gentleman, we can say.

29
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,780
Radha Krishna.

30
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Now this special happening took place long
time back. This is at the stage of Vaikunta

31
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,780
as we call it, at the stage where nothing
existed as far as this world was concerned.

32
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,060
At different stages it came up. We see the
world in such a way that it was created in

33
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,100
seven days, but actually these are seven stages
in when this whole Universe was created and

34
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,650
we are at the seventh stage, we can say. Now
at the first Vaikunta stage where it was all

35
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,650
decided, how to work it out the creation of
this great personality, of the Son of God,

36
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,940
the greatest of all, the Adhara, the support
of the universe, this Mahavishnu. So Radha,

37
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,120
She’s Mahalakshmi, She is the central path.
First She created Him in the Vaikunta stage.

38
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,620
And at that stage She decided that She’ll
create It by Herself this great Incarnation

39
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,020
and She created this Mahavishnu. I would like
you to get the translation of the description

40
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,250
of Mahavishnu and also the description of
Ganesha who is the Spirit of Christ and who

41
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,580
incarnated in this, on this earth as our Lord
Jesus Christ.

42
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,980
So we have here an Incarnation, a very special
one, which was conceived thousands and thousands

43
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:52,419
of years back at this level where it’s only
the activity of the God’s mind was there,

44
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,620
Vaikunta stage, where it was decided that
this power called Radha will conceive Him

45
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,880
in Her heart. And She conceived Him in Her
heart. And then He was made like an egg. See

46
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,080
the symbolism of Easter, like an egg. Can
you recognize it? People knew about it somehow.

47
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Why do we have Easter, eggs? We never think
about it. He was created like an egg out of

48
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:47,889
which the half of it was kept as the seed,
as Shri Ganesha, as the Spirit, and a half

49
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,620
of it was created as Jesus Christ. The whole
egg was nothing but the egg of this Divine

50
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:08,270
power, which has to manifest this Divine power
on this Earth.

51
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:16,220
This story is very beautiful, how She created
and then He asked: “Who is my Father?”

52
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Radha is nobody else but Mother Mary Herself.
She is Mahalakshmi. People may say that they

53
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,949
can’t believe in immaculate birth of Christ.
They cannot believe in the conception of Christ.

54
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:39,759
I mean you it’s easy for people to say:”
We don’t believe.” What do they know about

55
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,930
God? What do they know about His mysterious
ways of doing it? Can you say how you convert

56
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,930
or you transform a flower into a fruit? You
don’t know anything about living miracles

57
00:08:54,449 --> 00:09:01,449
and you start doubting the Immaculate Conception.
Here, when you got your Realization I conceived

58
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,220
you in My heart and gave you Realization through
My Sahasrara. How did you get your Realization?

59
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,029
You never thought of it. Is an impossibility.
Thousands of people are getting Realization.

60
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:24,970
How is it possible? There must be something
special about Me and about the way it is done.

61
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,519
In the same way She conceived and gave Him
the birth through Her uterus.

62
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,519
You can move it anywhere on your central system.
And this great Incarnation came on this Earth

63
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:54,319
with such a special purpose that He was nothing
but Pranava, is the, this integrated power,

64
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:06,269
this great power which has all the powers
in it: the Iccha Shakti, the Prana Shakti

65
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:15,119
and the Dharma Shakti is the central path,
all of these put together. He was nothing

66
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:22,470
but energy, energy put into an egg because
He had to do a very great job. So this Radha

67
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:40,550
Herself, this Mahalakshmi, this Mother Mary
conceived this child and to name Him after

68
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:54,069
Krishna who was the Father. She called Him
Christ. Christ come from the word ... In Indian

69
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:03,199
language is, we call Him Krist, Krishna. Krishna
means the one who has sown the seed. He is

70
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:11,939
the Father. He points out always to the Father.
But in the Puranas it is described that Krishna

71
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:18,939
said: “You are higher than Me. I placed
You higher than Me”. He placed Him, you

72
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:27,300
can imagine that Christ is at this point and
Krishna is at this point. He placed higher

73
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Him than Him and He said: “In anywhere people
worship Me – Shri Krishna said – automatically

74
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:46,579
You are worshipped. You will be the support,
Adhara, of the whole world.”

75
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:54,069
Is wonderful to say that about I think 14000
years or 12000 years back, Markandeya, such

76
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:02,009
a great saint was born in India. And he has
written the complete Ganesha Stotram, means

77
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:08,720
the complete praise of Ganesha. You can see
the translation is so beautiful and that he

78
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,720
said: ”You’ll be so humble”. He is the
one who is the ninth Incarnation called as

79
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,610
[BAUTHA] among the ten Incarnations. That
He will be so humble that He will wash the

80
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:36,329
feet of His disciples. All the miracles of
Christ are described in these books. But these

81
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,119
books are not translated.

82
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:48,119
And that He will be the one, when enlightened
within you with the Kundalini, He will take

83
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:58,679
away all your karmas and all your conditionings
because He will die for your sins, for your

84
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:09,429
karmas. The world will not have to suffer
anymore, if He is awaken within you. These

85
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:22,689
are all the things already written, thousands
of years back. Can you imagine? I wish the

86
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:30,449
Christians who went from here to take, explain
Christianity to Indians told them that Mahavishnu

87
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:38,249
is already born and we are preaching about
Him, the One who is going to suck your conditioning,

88
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:47,119
the One who is going to suck all your problems
of karmas. They never told. On the contrary,

89
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:55,259
they were so stupid, I must tell you, that
they would put a loaf in a well and say that:

90
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:02,029
“You all have become Christians because
we have put the meat of the beef, the beef

91
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:08,069
inside the well”. Indians don’t eat beef,
you see. “So you all have become Christians”.

92
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:12,339
Villages after villages they converted into
Christianity. They started branding them as

93
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:19,339
Christians. This was absurd. And that’s
why the people were waiting and waiting for

94
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:22,639
the Advent of Christ.

95
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,639
His name Christ comes from the word Krishna,
Krist, and the second one is Jesus. Krishna

96
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:41,239
had a foster mother whom Radha loved very
much. Her name was Yeshoda, we also call her

97
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:49,220
as [Jesoda, Jeshoda]. Christ is called also
as [Yesu, Yeshu] in India. The short form

98
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,889
of [Jesoda, Jeshoda] is [Yesu, Yeshu] or [Jeshu,
Jesu] we have both the things. From there

99
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:02,889
the name Jesus has come. She wanted to name
Her after the foster mother because she was

100
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:12,149
a lady so she was called as [Jeshoda, Jesoda]
but for a man She selected the name [Yesu,

101
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:19,819
Yeshu] and [Jeshu, Jesu]. Moreover the word
[Jeshu, Jesu] or [Yeshu, Yesu] is very important.

102
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:30,100
“J” in Sanskrit language means, every
word has a meaning in Sanskrit language, means

103
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:37,100
to know, is to know, the knowledge, Gyana.
[SANSKRIT TALK]. The one who knows. But [Jeshu,

104
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,399
Jesu] [“shu”, “su”] means auspicious.
[“Shu”, “Su”] means “that brings

105
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:55,989
auspiciousness, that brings blessings”.
Jeshu is the one who knows how to bring auspiciousness

106
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,100
on this Earth. People never told this, they
never knew who went from here with the message

107
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:11,689
that Christ was born.

108
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:18,689
At the time when Christ came on this Earth
with this big message that somebody has to

109
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:26,089
pass through this special problem. Now let’s
see why the problem was there. We have to

110
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:33,889
understand the problem that faced human beings
at that subtle level where they had to work

111
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:40,889
out this special, a very extraordinary Incarnation.
The problem was that human beings had raised

112
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:53,029
their heads. By raising their heads their
ego and superego grew up around their limbic

113
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:02,290
area, making it a very hard shell, just like
an egg. A man developed his I-ness and only

114
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,130
way to transform him into a bird, like an
egg breaks up into a bird, was to make the

115
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:23,610
Kundalini rise. But how to make that compact
stuff where it is crossing, crossable, which

116
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:33,539
can be crossed over, which can be passed through.
So they had to create this special Incarnation,

117
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,860
which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the
Logos as you call it, the sound of the All

118
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,190
Pervading Power. To be put at a place where
nothing but the power itself can remain, because

119
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,470
anybody else, all other Incarnations who came
on this Earth had all the five elements within

120
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:11,470
them. But He was just the power, the energy,
the complete energy. He didn’t have, for

121
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:22,330
example we all human beings are made of five
elements on the right hand side as I told

122
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,330
you, and when we die the part that is our
body, means one of the five koshas, as they

123
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,139
call the cocoons of the body which is the
matter, falls off. Then the water cocoon also

124
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:45,139
falls off and the soul remains with the Spirit
on your head and the Kundalini also there.

125
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:53,210
But He was the only One who had no earth element
in it. And so it was a very special type of

126
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,409
an energy engulfed, engulfed into a human
being was placed.

127
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:11,409
Krishna has said about the eternal life and
about the Spirit. In Sanskrit language is

128
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,460
very beautiful because it’s a mantra: [SANSKRIT].
Means it cannot be killed by anyone, the Spirit

129
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:30,909
cannot be killed. It is eternal. You cannot
press it. It cannot be flown out by any wind.

130
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,940
And He had to prove it and to prove that they
had to have somebody here, on this Earth,

131
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,940
with that energy to come in, with a body,
to act like a human being, live like a human

132
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:56,559
being and go through that drama of death to
show that He overcomes the death. The Resurrection

133
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,720
is our message, that He resurrects Himself.
He had to die and He had to be resurrected

134
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:17,179
because He says that it is beyond death. Krishna
has said that the Spirit is beyond death.

135
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:24,179
And the Spirit had to come on this Earth.

136
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:32,409
So you understand when we talk of Christ how
little we know as to how this worked out.

137
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,799
Is the most difficult thing that he did. And
His Mother was the Mahalakshmi, is the power,

138
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,630
which is the central power of sustenance,
pure sustenance, pure holiness, pure innocence.

139
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Such a powerful woman She was, very powerful.
And Himself is endowed with, you won’t believe,

140
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:12,840
with eleven powers of Rudra, means of destruction,
eleven powers of Rudra. He’s Ekadesha Rudra.

141
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Is described, all that is described, I’m
not telling it as My own. You can see for

142
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,470
yourself. He was endowed with eleven powers
of destruction. But He was to go through all

143
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:39,720
this, with all the humility. When you have
all these powers with you and when egoistical

144
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,720
people behave like this, these donkeys, you
see, who could not understand Him, these brainless

145
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,950
people in those days, who could not believe
Him, He could have destroyed all of them in

146
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:06,759
one [SHOT, SHUT]. Absolutely He has got eleven
Rudras. You can imagine His destructive powers,

147
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:13,759
with which He is going to come back. And He
had to keep them in control.

148
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:21,850
But He didn’t say about His Mother much,
because She was the power and if He had said

149
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:31,090
so, then they would have directed, these negative
forces would have directed all their attention

150
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:37,539
towards Her and then He would have used all
these eleven powers and the whole drama would

151
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,759
have been failed. So He kept quiet on that.

152
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,450
My father, as I told you, was a learned man
and a very great soul and [WE] used to discuss

153
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:53,450
about these things and I said: “Martin Luther,
who was a Realized soul, when he started his

154
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:01,679
new movement of Protestants, why did he not
enhance the glory of the Mother?” As the

155
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:14,509
Catholics knew, because Catholics just followed
after Christ so it linked about with them.

156
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:22,090
My father told Me that at that time Martin
Luther faced three forces against him. First

157
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:29,690
one was the Christians themselves, the Catholics,
who believed in nunneries and all kinds of

158
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:36,690
ritualism and all kinds of nonsense, which
he wanted to flout, then he had another force,

159
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,240
which was facing and that one was the one
that came from the Jews because they would

160
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,480
not accept Him. Even today they don’t accept
Him. They are very adamant. And the third

161
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:05,789
force that he had to face was the Islam, Islamic.
And the Islam pleaded down the role of a woman

162
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:13,539
though Fatima Herself was the Holy Ghost,
is the Mahakali power, the daughter of Mohammad.

163
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:25,750
But he pleaded down just because the Islam
had pleaded down he thought gradually as Protestants

164
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:33,509
will grow up, he will start introducing the
greatness of His Mother. As it is Jews even

165
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:46,929
today are after the Immaculate Conception.
In London, very recently, I think about two

166
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,789
years back, as they have money they paid some
of the newspapers and published something

167
00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:01,789
nonsensical about Christ. They said that it
was predicted in the Bible that a child will

168
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:11,870
be born to a girl, but it was not a virgin,
the Hebrew word, as it is, is for the girl

169
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:20,799
and not a virgin. I said: “In those days,
we didn’t have girls of 18 years as we have

170
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,519
today”. Even in India today if you say a
girl, a [KANYA,] means a virgin, [KANYA] and

171
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,720
virgin is the same, means the Virgo.

172
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,139
Modern times are funny. We can’t judge Christ
style according to modern times. Even you

173
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:45,139
find a woman who is married ten times they’ll
call her a girl here. But one should logically

174
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:53,070
understand this point. Is very logical. But
if it was to be said that a prophecy means

175
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:59,710
something special, that a child would be born
to a girl, of course it is going to be born

176
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,710
to a girl and not to a boy. And why was the
girl word? It is going to be born to a boy.

177
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,340
If it is to a woman it is nothing special.
What is there to prophesize and say about

178
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,340
it? Is so logical that when the word girl
came in it meant the virgin. All kind of things

179
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,639
they are talking, doesn’t matter.

180
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:31,759
First of all they say that our, we have to
suffer till our Savior comes because Christ

181
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:38,759
didn’t suffer for them. So they are suffering.
Now, we have to know that Christ has suffered

182
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:51,299
for us absolutely to the brim. We don’t
have to suffer anymore. Is a nonsensical idea

183
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:03,070
coming from people who are sadistic, who have
no joy in themselves. They cannot see you

184
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,500
happy. And that’s why also they make Christ
look like a TB patient, I should say. I went

185
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:28,379
to the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo was
a realized soul, a great person. He has done

186
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:38,419
complete justice to the image of Christ. Huge
big thing like a, we can say, a Texas fellow

187
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:45,549
standing with a lambodara, with a big stomach
of this kind. Ganesha is lambodara. Standing

188
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:55,830
there throwing people right and left. Just
see the words, how He has spoken. He was not

189
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:09,529
a cabbage like person, He was extremely dynamic,
He was full of vigor, He was absolutely fearless.

190
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:16,529
He had nothing to fear. And He’s standing
there and throwing people to the left and

191
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:24,090
the right and the right ones is accepting
them and putting them in the Kingdom of Heaven.

192
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,710
Just imagine! It is Michelangelo is the only
person who has really done justice to Him

193
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,639
and I would say Rubens because of his habits
of painting the muscles, he’s done a very

194
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:39,659
beautiful painting, I saw, is in the place
where he lives, of the ascent and descent

195
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,090
of Christ. Beautiful, one of the best one
could think.

196
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:52,090
Nowhere miseries written on His face. Such
people do not feel the misery. They just watch

197
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:59,419
the drama. They don’t suffer because of
taking up your sufferings it took it upon

198
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:13,889
Himself and He showed to the world that: “Now
I ask forgiveness from My Father”. He stood

199
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:26,330
as a representative of all the seekers of
the world before His Father who is a wrathful

200
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:33,870
Father. I told you Shri Krishna has a Samara
Shakti and worse than that is the witness

201
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:40,870
God whom we call as Sadashiva. He is only
there when He has to destroy. And He asks

202
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:55,269
as your representative: “O Father, please,
forgive them”. He asks for forgiveness,

203
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:03,529
facing His own Father as your representative
that: “Please, forgive them”. This is

204
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:11,289
the greatest weapon He has given us, to forgive.
That’s one thing none of the Christian nations

205
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:22,399
are doing, is to forgive. Perhaps people have
not known the power of love. They do not.

206
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:31,230
They talk. God is love. Just talk, talk, talk,
talk. If God is love then love must be the

207
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,090
most powerful thing.

208
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:41,090
When I first started My work I flouted all
these fake gurus by names in India and I told

209
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,320
them what devils they had been and I‘ve
known them for ages. And people told Me that:

210
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,990
“They will shoot You this time”. I said:
“Let them start shooting. I’ll se who

211
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,789
can shoot Me.” [AND ALL THOSE I HAVE] flouted
them anywhere I get the chance. I’ve told

212
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:06,419
that: “These are horrible people“. As
Christ has said: “Hot or cold.” He doesn’t

213
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,610
mind, because if it is cold they are realized,
if they are hot then we’ll fight them. We

214
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:18,070
can tell them how. But if they are one lukewarm,
you see, there are people: “O, we are in

215
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,769
different awareness, they are in different
awareness, we must accept this awareness also,

216
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:29,119
we must accept...” Such people are the ones
He said: “I’ll spout them out of My mouth”.

217
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,639
So clearly. He’s the One who whipped people
who were selling things in the temple. He

218
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:41,710
is the One who said: “Don’t throw pearls
before the swine.” So far I’ve never used

219
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:48,710
this word but He has. He was dynamic. He was
not afraid of anyone. And He couldn’t bear

220
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:59,090
the mediocrity and this kind of balance: “Oh,
we have them also, we can have the devils

221
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:04,369
and also the Gods”. People argue: “Why
do You criticize them? They don’t criticize

222
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:11,110
You”. He said: “The devil, the Satan is
not going to speak against his own house”.

223
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,960
This is exactly what is happening today. I’ve
seen when I say that: “This man is a devil”,

224
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,379
people say: “Mother, why do you call him
a devil?” “Because he’s a devil, I have

225
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:29,379
to call him a devil. I’m your Mother.”
When I see a person suffering, he cannot get

226
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,990
his Realization because he went to this devil,
I have to say he’s a devil whether you like

227
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,110
it or not. If you are a true seeker you stand
up to that and see for yourself you are a

228
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:46,710
true seeker. And if you are a true seeker
you must find your Spirit and you must get

229
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,940
to your Realization.

230
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,940
I’m not here for any elections or pampering.
I’m here to give you your own, to have your

231
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,080
own Spirit, to enjoy your being. Even if the
whole world gets against Me, I’m not bothered

232
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,320
about it. I’m here of course to look after
you, to tell you in a proper way. But if it

233
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:21,539
comes to the devils I will be the One who
will stand against them, every minute. Whatever

234
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,809
may they come in, whatever guard, it’s very
easy to make them out once you get your Realization.

235
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:34,799
It’s very easy to find out. He Himself has
said it all these things. He said: “Don’t

236
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,759
judge anyone”. Before Realization you can’t
judge anyone, from the appearances. They look

237
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:45,759
very sweet, you know, or they talk very sweetly.
They come to you in a band, you see, and they

238
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:56,369
walk with such beautiful gait. They are great
dramatist, some of them play tricks, jump

239
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:00,809
like Krishna. Some say: “We are Incarnation
of Christ.”

240
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:07,809
There was a gentleman who said: “I’m the
Incarnation of Krishna”. I told him: “Why

241
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:15,379
do you make the ladies nude and naked? What
religion has taught you this, to make the

242
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:22,120
ladies nude and naked, take out their clothes
and make them dance? What is this?” “O,

243
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,760
he said, I’m Shri Krishna!” I said: “Really?
I never knew Shri Krishna did that.” He

244
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,400
said: “No, He did.” Once Krishna was a
small child of four years, you can imagine,

245
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,370
a naughty little thing. What did He understand
of nudity or that? Innocent. And the gopis,

246
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:45,700
you see, were having their bath in the river
Yamuna where Radha was putting Her feet, so

247
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:52,700
the water was all vibrated. And He climbed
up onto a tree and they had put their clothes

248
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,510
on a tree and He hid them. So they were asking
for His clothes: “Now what are you doing?

249
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,710
Why have you hidden?” It’s a mischief.
It’s the fun. But in that fun what He was

250
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,080
doing? Was to give them Realization because
He could see their Kundalini at the back.

251
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,290
[AS, AND] a child of four years... What does
a child of four years know about nudity, or

252
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:21,570
dress or anything? Innocent. Modern children
may be very precautious, but not in those

253
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,550
days. But when He was the king in Dwarika
– I asked this nonsensical fellow who says

254
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:34,010
he is the Bhagavanan, and the Shri Krishna
– I said when He was a grown up man and

255
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:41,010
a king in Dwarika, which is at least two thousand
miles away from Hastinapur Delhi, and a lady

256
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:49,500
called Draupadi, who called Him as a brother,
was troubled because she was pound and all

257
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,050
that, a big story of Mahabharata, you might
be knowing Draupadi, and a devil of a man

258
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,630
called Dhuriodhana said that: ” I’ll make
you nude”, tried to pull Her sari. It’s

259
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:08,630
a beautiful description of the whole thing.
He, He was worried that she will lose her

260
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,930
chastity by removing her..., this is called
as [SANSKRIT WORD]. So she put it in her mouth

261
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:26,070
like this and she was to call Krishna. She
says: “Kri”, and she was holding because

262
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:33,070
Krishna means “falls down”. And as soon
as she found that the sari is going, she said:

263
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,260
”shna”, and the description is so great:
“[SANSKRIT TALK]”. When she did that “shna”

264
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,260
it echoed in Dwarika where He was ruling.
He was the king there. And with shanka, chakra,

265
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:53,260
gada, padma, these are four weapons, one better
that the other. One is sufficient, the chakra,

266
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,650
I told you, all up on to on the Garuda, on
the condor He arrived there to save the chastity

267
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:13,330
of His sister. If He was fond of removing
the clothes of women, why did He all the way

268
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:20,570
come and save that? And this fellow didn’t
know how to answer Me. I told him: “One

269
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,620
day your clothes will be taken out like this”.
Within eight days it happened. Somebody took

270
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,040
out all his clothes and he was dancing on
the street and nowadays he’s backing America

271
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,040
with a paralysis. He couldn’t smell flowers.
One better that the other. But his disciples,

272
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,990
if you tell them: “O, don’t say, Mother.
We love him.”

273
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:51,990
This kind of a funny mesmerism it’s stupidity.
Awake yourself! This kind of emotional nonsensical

274
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:01,670
attachment to one person is not going to give
you Realization. You have to become your Spirit.

275
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:08,670
You have to be actually reborn. There is no
place for devilish people. If they are from

276
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,040
hell they will go back to that, but many of
their disciples are also walking through.

277
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,040
[WHILE, WHY] they are My children, I would
say? They are the children of God, they are

278
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:37,890
the men of God, as described as William Blake.
They have been born on this earth for seeking

279
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,340
because they know this is the time they are
going to achieve their Realization and these

280
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:52,340
horrible people have mesmerized them. At this
time should I go and garland them and say:

281
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,210
“You are very nice people”? If you expect
Me to do that, then you have not understood

282
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,990
Me at all. No use telling Me: “O, their
awareness is different.” I see that your

283
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:11,430
Kundalini is ruined, you are up to get a blood
cancer or some sort of a cancer or you are

284
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,590
going to get into the lunatic asylum. Something
horrible is going to happen to you and when

285
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:22,620
I see that am I to say “Yes” the one who
has done, go and fall at his feet? But if

286
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:29,620
there’s a real guru I would go and meet
him Myself. There are many, but they are hiding.

287
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:37,470
I sent one fellow to New York, he ran away
within two days, within two days. He said:

288
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,730
“O, these New York people are different”.
He said: “I have to take a circus with me.

289
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:49,730
They like a circus.” But Houston people
are different.

290
00:39:54,130 --> 00:40:01,130
Now, so this was the great Incarnation of
Christ who came on this Earth, a very dynamic.

291
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Those who say that: “I’m the Christ”,
there’s many, you see, self certified people:

292
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,920
“I’m the Christ”. Now the kind of a
Christ they do, He was never like that, He

293
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,920
was a healthy man and He was not one of these
people who’s these cheeks have gone inside,

294
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:29,220
who looks like a miserable, hungry, pitiable
man.

295
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,590
[MISSING RECORDING]

296
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:37,590
[THIS IS] of Holy Ghost, the Kundalini rises.
Is written down. There are thousand things

297
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,900
written and every word has to be tallied with
that person otherwise you just don’t believe.

298
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:03,210
Let them go and walk on the water, is not
far away from you, seventeen miles only, and

299
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:20,780
see how far they go. Is the best way to judge
these people. We have got a method to judge

300
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,100
these people. Thank God, we are born in modern
times when we are not [ILLITERATE], we have

301
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:34,230
had Christ, we have had so many people, we
can read and we can understand, we should

302
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:40,610
logically reach the position to understand
what do we have to expect from a Realized

303
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:47,610
Soul. If he talks like a politician who wants
to have votes, how can you believe that such

304
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
a person could be an Incarnation? An Incarnation
has not only to be a fearless person, but

305
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:02,840
has to be a holy person. Not the one who is
like a parasite living on other people. Like

306
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:09,840
these lamas [ARE]. They live like parasites
in Nepal and also in Lhasa [UNCLEAR] were

307
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,240
suffering. They had no food but these lamas
were living and taking their special Ambrose,

308
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
they call it, in golden cups. Today they are
driven out so they are on our head in India.

309
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,200
We have to support these nonsensical people
sitting down there as lamas, these parasites

310
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,060
of the worst type. And those who could not
get a place there are now moving about and

311
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,720
now they want to live on a marble flooring.
They can’t live on a carpet flooring. They

312
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,110
must have a marble flooring. And people have
to starve themselves to create a marble flooring

313
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,270
for these horrible parasites.

314
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:07,020
Why should a saint ask for anything? A saint
is a king. He’s above all these comforts

315
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:14,020
of life. He’s not bothered. I mean, if you
ask, I can sleep on the street, I’ve no

316
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,640
problem, no problem, because I’m above the
want, I’m above greed. I don’t know what

317
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,640
sort of a thing is temptation. If they call
themselves as Godly people, look at their

318
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,600
faces, worn out, biscuity, serious, nonsensical
people. They have no sense of humor of any

319
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:44,970
kind. Not only but I’ve seen some disciple
who came to Me, all their bone was broken,

320
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:50,690
all their back bone was broken, every bone
was broken by these people. They use to beat

321
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:57,690
them [THESE SADISTS]. They take money from
you and finish your Kundalini.

322
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:06,380
Their days have come now. Because they talk
well don’t believe them. What have they

323
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:15,240
given you? Somebody says: “They have given
us the knowledge”. All right, what knowledge?

324
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:22,240
What knowledge have they given you? Knowledge,
is all mental. What have you got it in your

325
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:28,420
awareness, where you have to evolve, when
you rise. Christ has described it so clearly,

326
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:35,420
I did not say what a Realized soul should
be. You become a witness, you become a witness

327
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,760
of the whole drama, of the whole show. And
this should happen to you. Not only, but you

328
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:53,960
are empowered with the powers of your Spirit.
At least your health should be all right.

329
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,880
People are suffering from stresses and strain,
having a headache all the time, jumping on

330
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,880
their sits and they say: “We get very positive
results”. What are positive results? These

331
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,310
make believes if you carry on with them you
will have no way of judging as to where you

332
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,080
are.

333
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,080
First of all get your Realization. Get to
your discretion power and realize that it

334
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,870
is you can judge them after Realization, not
before. Christ has said “right discretion”.

335
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:36,820
He has used the word: “right discretion”.
How do you get “right discretion” unless

336
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:43,820
and until you are realized? And this is not
to be self-certified. As Christ has said:

337
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,840
“You’ll be calling Me Christ, Christ.
I will not recognize you”. Meaning what?

338
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Those who say: “We are Christians”, you
see, going about with the label: “We are

339
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:05,900
Christians, we go to church, sing our hymns
and come back home and quarrel, going to wars,

340
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:14,010
fight. We are the people who drink on a Christmas
day. On a Christmas day, we drink!”

341
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:24,890
Now, when Christ said that, they said at the
time of Christ, He went to a wedding and He

342
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:31,310
blessed the wine. Is not true. That wine,
at that time never meant, even in India today,

343
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:37,900
wine never means an alcohol. But Moses has
talked about it very clearly and Abraham has

344
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:44,150
talked about it because they had to deal with
this wine which I told you, the Primordial

345
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,650
Masters, they had to deal with the liver,
so they talked about it, they called it the

346
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:56,650
“strong drink” and “fermented drink”,
so clearly. But everything happens if somebody

347
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:03,970
dies, you must have champagne to celebrate
his death perhaps. If Christ is born we must

348
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:10,970
have champagne. If Christ is born that is
the day we should dedicate ourselves to our

349
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:17,860
Spirit, not to get out of your awareness.
Anyone of these fermented things take you

350
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:24,860
away from your attention. Your attention is
in a way empathized. I don’t say: “You

351
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,070
don’t drink!” at this stage but after
Realization you will not. You will not, even

352
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:38,070
if you want to. You will not drink, because
you get drunk. Like Me, if I go to a party,

353
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,820
you see, they will always say: “Please,
have something. O, You must have, please.

354
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,050
You have not tested this. You better have”.
I said: “No, sir, I’m sorry, I’m over

355
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,140
drunk already. If I drink more, I don’t
know what will happen to Me”. I mean you

356
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,950
can’t tell them: “You don’t drink”.
You see, that would be absolutely [UNLIARLY]

357
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,760
to tell them: “Please, don’t drink today”.
But they’ll go on forcing you and if you

358
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,760
say anything against it then absolutely you
are no eliteness about you. You are absolutely

359
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,810
unsophisticated.

360
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:19,810
This is the thing in this world. Virtue has
no meaning. If you are virtuous, you better

361
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:28,170
hide yourself. Not in Sahaja Yoga. You enjoy
your virtues in Sahaja Yoga. You really enjoy

362
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:34,290
yours and others virtues. Is a very different
thing as in the unity church you call it,

363
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:41,290
a New Age is coming, is absolutely true. I
find, as I told you the principles of this

364
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:48,710
church are very, very close to that which
is the stage on to which you have to jump.

365
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,040
And that’s why the right conclusion that
is reached is absolutely the way to understand

366
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:10,690
where you have to reach logically. But you
must know, you have to take a stand. You cannot

367
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:23,490
be a person who’s apologetic. There is no
place for apologies. If you are a realized

368
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:33,750
soul, you are a realized soul. You are not
dominating it by that to anyone. You are not

369
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:40,750
dominating. By that you accept your situation
with glory and with pride. But I’ve seen

370
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:53,490
many Sahaja Yogis also feel shy to accept
that they are realized. They understand what’s

371
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:59,130
happening. They are giggling, they are laughing
at the way people are, but they find it impossible

372
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:06,130
to talk to them about their Realization, that
other should get their Realization. You have

373
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:13,330
to take a stand in your family, in your surroundings,
with your friends and you have to tell them

374
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:20,330
that: “You better all get realized”. The
reason for that is that the Christ who crucified

375
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:29,310
Himself, He is going to come back, with his
eleven forces of destruction. And then He’s

376
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:39,880
not going to tell you anything, not going
to ask you to take any Realization, nor He

377
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,880
is bothered whether you go to hell. He will
just sort out.

378
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:56,810
But those who have got Realization will enter
into the Kingdom of God. You have to enter

379
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:05,380
into the Kingdom of God. Here, as I say, is
the seventh chakra. I told you about the sixth

380
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:12,840
chakra, which is adorned by Jesus Christ and
the mantra of the (seventh chakra), sixth

381
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:21,950
chakra is our Lord’s Prayer. That’s the
way you can solve both the things. But the

382
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:28,950
bija mantra is Ham Ksham. Ham Ksham. It means
that when you are infested with negativity,

383
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:42,490
with depression, with the attack of the superego,
as shown here, then you have to say: “I

384
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:49,730
am, I’m going to fight you”. If you go
to a guru who makes you a negative person,

385
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:56,410
who makes you feel very shy, who says: “You
are all the ego and you are good for nothing,

386
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:00,780
you must pay me more and pay me more”. And
you all the time say that: “Oh, must be

387
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:07,060
something wrong with me, nothing wrong with
this man”. If there is self-pity and also

388
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:14,060
there is guilt, then you have to say: “I
am not guilty”. Then you have to say that:

389
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:20,270
“I’m my own guru”, if you have left
side problems. But if you have right side

390
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:27,270
problems, then you have to say: “I forgive,
Ham Ksham”. These are the bija mantras of

391
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:34,670
this two, which you have got, your symbol
is of these two wings, is actually the Agya

392
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:35,860
chakra.

393
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:42,860
It is just like that. Agya chakra is just
like that. But they call it the, what Egyptian,

394
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:49,710
what... no, is not that. You see, this symbol
has come to you from unconscious, is the Agya

395
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:56,710
chakra, is this center. Egyptians didn’t
know much about God, I must tell you. Of course

396
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:05,350
pyramid is, pyramid is, pyramid is all vibrated.
But the way they were so much worried about

397
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:12,350
their dead is horrifying. Imagine these bones
buried in the one box of gold, then one box

398
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,870
of silver, then one box of this and all the
ornaments kept with the dead. The dead is

399
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:25,600
finished into bones, the ornaments are there.
I’ve seen that in Egypt. Mad people, I must

400
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:32,420
say. It’s Sadat who would have brought it
round. But lets see something new will happen

401
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,360
there, in that country.

402
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:40,290
Traditional countries have wisdom, inbuilt
wisdom and they go on improving because they

403
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,700
have tried all these methods and they know
[WHERE TO GO]. He didn’t talk of death.

404
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:50,190
They know it from the people, pharaohs and
all that who had all these kinds of a funny

405
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:57,190
mummies going round and keeping the dead in
a silver box and as if the dead knows where

406
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:03,300
is the silver. Christ has said many things,
which we do not pay attention to. [NONE, ONE]

407
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:10,300
of them is about the dead. In every church,
I was happy to know that in this church there

408
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:19,480
is no cemetery. You walk into a cemetery if
you want to go to a church. A lady who came

409
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,260
from India, she said: “Everything seems
to be upside down in England”. I said: “What?”

410
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:29,270
She said: “I went to see a church. And all
the dead were laid there under my feet. And

411
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:33,930
I was holding my sari walking like this. I
was thinking I was going to step. And the

412
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:38,040
lady with me said: ‘What, you should walk
straight‘. She said: ‘How can I, you see?

413
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,060
These are dead here. It’s like a cemetery.”
And she was walking carefully because they

414
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,840
must be respected.

415
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:50,840
You take your children to those churches.
I mean I don’t know, you don’t understand

416
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:57,840
that God has talked about spirits in so clear
ways. Of course, maybe it’s not so much

417
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,180
in the Bible, maybe, but He showed that He
took out the spirits, He talked of spirits

418
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:11,180
of so many people, and put them in the pigs
and put them in the sea. All this is so clearly

419
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:19,270
given, still, just see the Christian nations.
Today’s newspaper, was there one free newspaper,

420
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:30,260
witchcraft, devils [TEN], devils angels, this
guru, that guru, psychic, ESP, all kinds of

421
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,100
spirits. Imagine! I mean in Indian picture
you won’t even find one advertisement like

422
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:49,100
that. Maybe some of the gurus might try, but
in India people know who is real and who is

423
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,690
not. Most of them know.

424
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:01,690
While here I find all kinds of things, which
are negative, which have something to do with

425
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:10,210
the spirits we are doing. It is against Christ.
Why should we bother ourselves about the spirits?

426
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:18,230
Let them alone. Like somebody’s father is
haunting, somebody’s mother is haunting.

427
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:24,580
Now, there’ve been so much for you! Now
forget them. Let them be born again to get

428
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,930
their Realization. Then you call somebody’s
spirit here, somebody’s spirit from dead.

429
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:36,930
Some spiritualist goes into a funny gesture
and you start believing that and asking about

430
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:43,320
your future and this and that. Is all very
superfluous and absolutely silly against your

431
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:49,400
Spirit. I’ve told you yesterday, those people
who indulge into these, for seven generations

432
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:56,400
they suffer, seven generations. I’m telling
you from My experience. And those who go to

433
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:04,120
them also suffer. Even the countries where
this is practiced too much. If a child is

434
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:10,690
born there, I know of a lady whose child was
born in a country like that, and he had this

435
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:17,460
Agya protruding just like this. And when he
saw Me, he started screaming and shouting,

436
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:23,600
he couldn’t bear Me. And today he’s a
different child, I saw. He’s a French child,

437
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,600
he’s a very different child. Absolutely.
But he was so much and so many spirits in

438
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:36,560
him, you can’t imagine. And she told Me
that she, she had a nurse who was form that

439
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,220
country and perhaps she has done something
to him.

440
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:46,750
So the source of this is already unlimited.
You don’t have to pay for it. You stand

441
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:53,220
outside and you can get anyone of them. It’s
very easy to catch on them, very easy. For

442
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,900
example, somebody asked Me: “How do you
catch a spirit?” I said: “Very simple.

443
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:03,840
You put a light before you, of course you
don’t try on that stick, and make a whole

444
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:10,840
in a black paper, little hole. And through
that hole you see the spirit. You see that

445
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:19,770
light and you’ll get a spirit into you.
You get any name, which is commonly used and

446
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:27,570
go on and chanting that name, you’ll get
into a spirit. You start saying any absurd

447
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:36,410
thing in the presence of God, in the presence
of the picture of God or of Christ, you insult

448
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:44,830
or do anything you get into it. It is the
easiest thing to get a spirit in you. You

449
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:53,780
start jumping too much, you get it, you start
saying: “Hooo”. You get it. You do any

450
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:00,940
funny thing, you get them. They are all around.
They are busy bodies. They want to use you

451
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:10,070
for their purpose. They are very easy available.
Why do you pay for them? Will you pay such

452
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:17,780
a lot of amount just to get one of them on
top of you? You 
have to be your master, I told you. You have

453
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:29,420
to be in the way Christ was. It’s only He
has the power to raise the Kundalini of people

454
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,830
like that, as you do now.

455
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:44,830
He was created in that immaculate way in which
you have been given Realization, in the same

456
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:52,530
immaculate manner. So have your self-esteem.
You are not going to become slave of these

457
00:59:53,490 --> 01:00:00,490
horrible useless sly aggressive people, who
are hanging around just to trouble you because

458
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,250
their ambitions are not fulfilled or they
are sly or they are sadists, or they are masochists

459
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:12,250
and all that kind of thing. You are seekers,
of high quality. Rise up to your Self. This

460
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:21,210
is the message of Christ to you, because He
resurrected Himself. Did you dance or did

461
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:30,930
you say Hu hu, haa? Even He was tempted by
Satan. And invited the Satan arrive there,

462
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:39,060
and invited. Nobody asked him to be there.

463
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:44,750
He has fasted for you, so you don’t fast.
If you fast, you’ll get a fasting spirit

464
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:50,880
in you. If you overdo your Hatha yoga you’ll
get a spirit, which will do much more Hatha

465
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,360
yoga till your ribs break out. Yeah. They
take you to extremes, you see. You see those

466
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:04,360
mad people running, jogging on the road. They
will get it very soon. I am worried about

467
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:14,430
them. You see, all these extra things, there
is no need to do. Today we saw one of the

468
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:21,270
circus or some sort of thing that was there,
they were three people from somewhere, I think

469
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,710
from Spain and [ALL THAT]. And the Vishuddhi
was so badly catching in them. Poor things

470
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:29,620
were putting all the pressure, going like
this, going like that. And they said they

471
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:34,170
are statues, whatever it is. I said, I had
simple pity for them. I said: “What are

472
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:40,610
they up to?” I mean, you can have real statues
like that. But why make human beings behave

473
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:47,610
so funny, so extra energy consumers? Why?
Why? You are human beings, you are delicate

474
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:58,300
things. Why do you want to stand on your heads?
Why do you want to do something that you are

475
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:05,300
not supposed to do? You have to stay in the
central path, in a sensible way, in a very

476
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:15,190
normal way, to get your Realization. We’ll
not do anything that is extreme. Always avoid

477
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,330
extremes.

478
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:23,310
But you tell something to someone. Is impossible.
Human beings must start doing it. You give

479
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:32,170
him a cycle, till he breaks his head, he will
not give up his cycle. You give them the skates,

480
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:38,610
till he completely is in an accident, he won’t
give up his skates. It’s impossible to deal

481
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:45,610
with them. To be in the centre is the easiest
thing. Just to be in the center, in the balance.

482
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,810
Before going to the Sahasrara, I want to tell
you about the balancing, because tomorrow

483
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:59,510
I’m going to tell you how the diseases are
caused. So the balance is... Because if you

484
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:06,510
use anyone of these powers, for the first
power is of superego, through which we run

485
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,140
away from places, we avoid, we are frightened,
we have fears. The another is of aggression,

486
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,880
right hand side, is the ego.

487
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,270
Anyone of them if you use too much, the other
one gets frozen. For example, a person who

488
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:26,750
thinks too much and plans too much and thinks
that he is responsible for the whole world

489
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,500
of affairs, you see, and he is doing all the
work, while he doesn’t do anything, God

490
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:37,500
does everything. In the myth that he is, develops
his ego to a great extent by which his left

491
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:44,820
side suffers too much. And then, first thing
he develops is all the problems of the left

492
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:52,280
side in the organ. First of all, the poor
Swadhishthana cannot look after the liver

493
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:59,220
so he develops a liver, then on the left hand
side it is absolutely useless, so he develops

494
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:05,360
diabetes. Diabetes is not caused by sugar
by any chance, I can tell you. Of course,

495
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,440
you should not take too much sugar, also.
I mean, too much of everything is wrong. But

496
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,970
you must take sugar. Is important for your
liver to have your sugar diet. But it’s

497
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:21,970
the idea in the head that if you take sugar
you get diabetes. Not at all. It is caused

498
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:29,350
by over thinking. Absolutely. Not by sugar.
In an Indian village, a farmer takes at least

499
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:37,840
every day half a kilo of sugar, for your information.
And they do not know what diabetes is because

500
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:44,840
he doesn’t think. He just does.

501
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:54,220
If you want to solve your problem of diabetes,
you have to develop your thoughtless awareness,

502
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:01,620
which you get when Christ is awakened within
you. He thinks for you. You don’t have to

503
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:08,420
think. You just be in that silence, that bliss.
And then Swadhishthana can look after the

504
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:15,420
other side. Diabetes is absolutely curable
through Sahaja Yoga. Then people who suffer

505
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:22,570
from the troubles of the spleen, like anemia
and all those things. But the worst of all

506
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:31,150
is the blood cancer. Blood cancer is the worst
thing you suffer from spleen. Now, how it

507
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:38,230
is caused? A person who’s very busy, you
see, is big man, he has no time. So he gets

508
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:45,770
out of his bed, puts on his trousers and he
is there for the breakfast, standing he’s

509
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:51,510
eating something. All right. Poor this spleen
is trying to cooperate that emergency, is

510
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:58,510
trying to give some blood. Suddenly he jumps
into his car, he’s driving, he goes and

511
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,650
meets other who are on the way, have jammed
this way, so he’s cursing them, doing all

512
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:10,650
kind of things. He is very speedy, you see.
He must go and he can’t bear that jam. This

513
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:19,320
speediness comes to you because this spleen
becomes mad. It becomes crazy. It doesn’t

514
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:26,320
know how to cope with the man like that. He
has no time to sit down and eat.

515
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:33,720
Formerly, in India, the husband, of course
our system is rather different, which the

516
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,920
American women won’t like, but we have been
very successful with our methods, you see.

517
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:45,920
It’s a trick I will tell you. The women
must know cooking in India. They might be

518
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:55,080
the richest of rich. They must know cooking.
They know very good cooking, excellent. You

519
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:02,080
know, you approach your man through his stomach,
always is true. Hundred percent. And then

520
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:07,920
they make the husband sit down comfortably.
In India, we sit on, I mean we have a kind

521
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,270
of a – what you call a [HINDI WORD], we
can say a stool which is very low and the

522
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:18,570
husband sits there and another stool in front
of him. And she sits there with a fan, you

523
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:24,180
see, she’s fanning him. The rhythm of the
food is with the fan. And she serves him and

524
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:30,500
she looks after him, and she talks to him
very sweetly at that time when he eats his

525
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:37,500
food. That’s the sign of a Gruha Lakshmi,
of the, of the, what is, the Goddess of the

526
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:45,100
family. She’s very kind to him, then he
likes those relaxed moments. She feeds him.

527
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Then he gets up and dresses up and goes to
his work. This kind of peace we should give

528
01:07:53,260 --> 01:08:00,260
to our husbands, if you have to control them.
You have not to compete with them always they

529
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:10,110
are like children, I tell you. They are so
sweet. Somebody told Me: “Mother, you must

530
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:19,810
go and describe your self esteem, Mother of
women”. I said: “What?” “Yes, there

531
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:25,560
are many women who are expecting their Mother
Goddess to come.” I said: “But I’m sorry,

532
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:32,560
I’m Mother of men as well as of women. For
Me both of them are just the same, two chariot’s,

533
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,850
the two wheels of a chariot. One is on the
left, another in the right”.

534
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:45,850
Is great thing to be a woman, I must say.
Like this Mother Earth, she bears us because

535
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:52,750
she’s so powerful. If you are a powerful
person you can bear it up. For example, husband

536
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:57,940
has to get angry with you sometimes. If he
gets angry with somebody in the office, he

537
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:04,940
loses his job, he’ll be fired. But if he
sometimes gets angry with you, it’s all

538
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:12,220
right. Doesn’t matter. It’s just fun.
But a woman has to be that playful, that cheerful

539
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:18,210
and that understanding should be in a woman.
What is there to compete with them? You are

540
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:24,819
the power, the potential. You have to give
that power of love to your husbands. In Sahaja

541
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:31,450
yoga we have changed the entire system of
society, also. It’s such a beautiful relationship

542
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:36,220
between husband and wife, such a beautiful
one among children and parents and.... It’s

543
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,390
so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

544
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:45,390
That age has to come. We are not to fight
for any rights, we have every rights. A woman

545
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:51,380
has every right within herself. She doesn’t
know how to handle it. And they have gone

546
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:58,370
crazy. They don’t know what to do with these
men. It’s very easy to handle them. You

547
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:05,370
have to learn the art of expressing your love.
That’s the thing we lack. We should come

548
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:14,650
from your heart to understand that we can’t
live without each other. This will stop many

549
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:19,320
things that are going wrong in this country
and the injustice we are doing to the children

550
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,420
who are born to us.

551
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:30,420
Now this is I am saying because Christ has
blessed marriage. Those who believe in nunneries

552
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:37,560
and all that are really nonsensical. And the
nuns getting married to this innocence? I

553
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:44,200
mean, how can innocence marry? This is the
worst thing you can do to Christ is to say

554
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:51,200
that: “This nun is married to Christ”.
I just can’t bear the idea. Is absurd, is

555
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:56,750
an insult of innocence. And this is what it
is, we should understand, that marriage is

556
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:03,750
blessed by Him. Is a sacred thing. We should
not make a mess out of it. Is so pure. Is

557
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:16,180
very beautiful. You enjoy each other in company,
also in separation you do enjoy. If you know

558
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:25,770
how to be sweet to each other, is so beautiful.
It’s very beautiful. These traditions will

559
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,530
come back as soon as you become the Spirit.
I’m sure of it.

560
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:37,530
Now, so we come, I told you about the imbalances
to a great extend, but later on tomorrow also

561
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,440
I‘m going to tell you because Sahaja Yogis
have to look after their imbalances to keep

562
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:50,060
their health all right and to look after the
health of other people also.

563
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:56,460
Now about the tenth chakra, the last chakra
as called the seventh chakra, seventh chakra,

564
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:03,460
which is very important. This chakra has got
all these seven centers in it. It is placed

565
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:17,050
in the brain. The brain, if you have a transverse
section of that, you can see it looks like

566
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:24,430
a lotus leaves. It is said there are one thousand
nerves, or one thousand centers or plexuses

567
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:33,670
for this particular center called as Sahasrara.
Sahasrara means one thousand petals. And these

568
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:43,650
petals are shown there. Of course they are
not one thousand there, but they look like

569
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:50,250
living flames of different colors. “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames.”

570
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:57,250
It’s said. Even the other centers look like
tongues of flames, you see, the flames were

571
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:05,140
enlighten. But the living flames are very
silent. They are placed as a lotus and as

572
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:14,270
the Kundalini comes up She pushes this lotus
out and you touch the seat of the Spirit,

573
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:21,820
which is on top of your head and you enter
into the super consciousness.

574
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:26,940
Not into the collective subconscious or not
into the collective supraconscious, but into

575
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:32,810
the super consciousness, where you become
the master, you become the Spirit. And you

576
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:39,810
start feeling the All Pervading Power around
you. And through your fontanel bone area you

577
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:47,280
feel the cool breeze, you actually feel it.
It’s an actualization. It is not just that

578
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:55,650
I baptized you, you are being baptized, it
is not possible. On the contrary, I’ve seen

579
01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:04,490
some people who touch the fontanel bone area
of the children introduce spirits. Yes. It

580
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:14,150
should be done only by a Realized soul and
not by every Dick, Tom and Harry. Is a very

581
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:17,130
dangerous thing.

582
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:24,130
Now, this Sahasrara has got all the seven
centers, the seats of all the seven centers

583
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:31,190
are there. Start from here is the Agya chakra.
Here is the Vishuddhi. Then here is the Heart.

584
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:42,430
Now see, it’s so simple. Heart. If it is
not heart felt, if you have not felt it from

585
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:50,280
your heart... Because some people come from
other gurus, I’ve seen them. They sit here

586
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:57,280
just to mock and laugh at it and make fun
of it. They never get Realization. If your

587
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,000
heart is caught up with your ego, also is
difficult. If your heart is weak, maybe any

588
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,440
problem with the heart, it can be anything,
I mean, so the Realization here stops. Heart

589
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:20,180
has to be strong, you have to have a heart
felt desire. That’s the center here of the

590
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:28,610
heart. So I told you this is the center here
of the Agya chakra, Vishuddhi chakra. This

591
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:35,840
is the center is the, is the, we can say,
a [SATELLITE, SUBTLE OF IT], of the Agya chakra

592
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,150
between the two, because here these two also
come out a little bit, the Ha Tha, both of

593
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:48,150
them come out here, down below. It’s Hamsa.
But main chakra is this Agya and then there

594
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,900
is the center of Vishuddhi, then here is the
center of Heart.

595
01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:01,900
Now, behind here, is the center of Mooladhara,
here, just in the center. For example today

596
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:11,120
I met a lady who told Me she’s loosing her
eyesight. It could be due to two things only.

597
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:18,580
It could be due to diabetes or it could be
due to some possession you can lose you eyesight.

598
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:28,280
Now, if it is in the center, it is a possession.
But diabetes is caused by the Swadhishthana

599
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:35,280
chakra around it. So even if it is due to
diabetes it can constrict the optic globe

600
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:42,610
by which you can have problem on your eyesight.
Your eyes will be open, but suddenly you can’t

601
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:49,610
see anything. This is absolutely curable,
absolutely curable. Spirits, they get to it.

602
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:56,430
How much we have to be careful about spirits
that you will realize very soon, as soon as

603
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,980
you will take to Sahaja yoga.

604
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:05,980
So the center here of the Agya is caught up
and when it is caught up it just makes the

605
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:19,270
optic globe ineffective and you can’t see.
Your eyes are open, you can’t see. And when

606
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:28,130
this diabetes is setting this center around
which is the Swadhishthana chakra, gets affected.

607
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:35,130
Vishuddhi chakra is here, is here. I mean
Nabhi chakra, is here. This is Nabhi chakra,

608
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:44,580
which has got left and right. So all these
centers are in 
the brain, so the essence of Sahasrara is

609
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:57,780
integration, unity, complete integration.
You cannot integrate nonsensical things together.

610
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:08,620
Integration is only possible of the people
who are of the same style, or of the Deities

611
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:18,570
who stand for God.

612
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:25,570
You cannot have satanic people and Godly people
integrated, can you? You cannot unite these

613
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:32,340
people. You try it and you’ll have problem.
That’s the best way you see the destruction

614
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:39,340
of every unity. So in Sanskrit is a very good,
good word got for integration, Samagra, beautiful

615
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:47,750
word which means, Agra is the, Agra is the
hole in the needle, and when a thread passes

616
01:18:54,820 --> 01:19:01,820
through this needles, it passes through the
Agra, so it is Samagra. And this integration

617
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:10,540
has to take place as soon as you cross over.
And because of this you get your Realization

618
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:19,150
and you feel all the chakras are enlightened.
Unless and until you pass through this fontanel

619
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:27,030
area you cannot feel the All Pervading Power.
With awakening only, with the awakening of

620
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:34,500
the Kundalini, you can give Realization even
to people, you may think, but it won’t stay

621
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:41,360
there. But, of course, you can cure people,
all right. But with Realization, if you establish

622
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:48,360
yourself, which I’ll tell you how to do
it tomorrow, then you can give Realizations

623
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:57,400
to others, you can manifest all your powers,
even you can control the element, for your

624
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:00,380
information. Yes, after some time.

625
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,770
We have some people in India. There’s an
ordinary fisherman, again a fisherman, he

626
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:12,750
is educated, he’s a graduated, but he’s
a fisherman. His name is Harish Chandra. He’s

627
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:18,880
a Realized soul. He got his Realization. He
said: “Mother, I never knew you have given

628
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,600
me so many powers.” I said: “Really? What
happened?” He said: “I was going to a

629
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:30,600
village across to another island and the whole
area was covered with clouds in such a way

630
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:41,880
that a tempest was expected, absolutely, horrible.
And people said: ’Don’t go out’”.

631
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,880
He said: “I was so much frustrated, I just
stood up there and I said: ‘Now see, I’m

632
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:54,480
going for God’s work. And will you, please,
behave yourself till I come back?’”. And

633
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,070
he said: “The clouds were removed. Went
there and came back, when I reached my home

634
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,440
in the night, that time it started raining”
and there were 25 people other fishermen with

635
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:11,440
him. In India the work is taking up a big
form, among the villagers, among the people

636
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:21,130
who are simple. You do not lack behind. Though
they are simple people, they are good people.

637
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:32,350
You are the leaders, you are great saints,
you have been seeking for ages and now the

638
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,670
time has come for you to get it. So do not
miss it.

639
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:46,260
For anybody’s sake, do not plead for any
gurus or anyone. You just plead for yourself.

640
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:53,260
You have paid them, finish it off. Done your
duty. It was a mistake. Forget it. Get your

641
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:03,100
Realization. Get to your Spirit. The Sahasrara
is opened out, is opened out because of this

642
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:14,890
Sahaja yoga has become a mass movement now.
Thousands can get Realization. Thousands.

643
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,540
They have been thousand people, six thousand
people, as he says this, that’s true. It

644
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:27,930
is true. It is true. It has happened. It’s
so miraculous. But you are miraculous you

645
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:34,930
are great. Just to find out yourself, what
a great instrument you are. You’ll be amazed

646
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:39,420
what things you can do.

647
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:46,420
I can write a chapter like a book on Sahasrara,
because that’s My place. I know it so well.

648
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:54,360
But today I think that is sufficient and later
on I hope you might be able to get the books

649
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:05,520
on this, maybe tomorrow, and then you might
be able to read about it. But first get your

650
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:11,810
Realization, because without Realization if
you read you’ll again become a scholar good

651
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:18,170
for nothing. That’s why we don’t sell
our books to people who are not realized.

652
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:25,170
We just don’t, because they become scholars,
you see. They start writing another book.

653
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:32,590
I mean people are so funny. What’s the use?
Christ has said: “Now, if you want gold,

654
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:39,970
all right, have it, but be zealous. I eat
with those who enter into the Kingdom of God”.

655
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:51,850
Take to the Kingdom of God and do not worry
about your intellectual feeds. You’ve had

656
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:52,920
enough of it. Take to it.

657
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,170
May God bless you all.

658
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:59,010
Now today, if you have some questions, you
may ask but I think we should go in [UNCLEAR]

659
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:06,010
experience, but if you have questions and
if you are not representing any guru, then

660
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:22,090
please ask. I don’t want to talking, answering
[IN CONTROVERSY, QUESTIONS ABOUT]…. I’ve

661
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:29,930
already told you about them and I do not want
to hear anything about these horrible people.

662
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:38,400
You know, yesterday somebody argued about
Yogananda. And this lady [UNCLEAR]: “O God,

663
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:46,420
it’s feeling hot. The certificate is there.”
All right, if you have to ask questions, do

664
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:52,620
not be aggressive and just get your Realization.
That’s the main thing you should have.

665
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:59,620
Question: I’d like to know if Mother is
a vegetarian.

666
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:07,290
Shri Mataji: No, not at all. So, supposing
I was Kali once upon a time, I had to drink

667
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:20,900
the blood of these horrible devils. How could
I be a vegetarian? Krishna was not a vegetarian,

668
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:29,480
Rama was not a vegetarian. Don’t become
vegetarians, I cannot save chickens and I

669
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,090
cannot give them Realization. That doesn’t
mean that you all the time eat meat, meat,

670
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:38,310
meat. Also doesn’t mean all the time think
of food. You see, I’m not bothered what

671
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:45,310
I eat. If you ask Me what I ate in the morning,
I don’t know. There’s no fuss about food.

672
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:53,080
I’m not a vegetarian. How could I be? Hindu
Indians know that, that Mother can’t be

673
01:25:53,400 --> 01:26:00,400
a vegetarian. Krishna could not be because
He had to kill so many people. And you should

674
01:26:03,739 --> 01:26:08,880
not be. By becoming vegetarian you won’t
reach to God, I can tell you. On the contrary,

675
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,880
you catch on the left Nabhi if you become
these horrible vegetarians like the Jains

676
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:22,000
we have in India. Jains, have you heard about
them, Jains? They try to save even the mosquitoes

677
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
and 
the bugs. Now, I can’t do, I can’t do
anything about mosquitoes and bugs. [I MEAN

678
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:41,620
IT HAS GONE, AND WE CAN GO] to that absurd,
you [KNOW, SAW]?

679
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:48,620
Those who talked about it, you read in the
book, where Buddha and Mahavira, they couldn’t

680
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:55,080
bear the way people were stupid. So they were
born again as Hassan and Hussein, the grandchildren

681
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:02,080
of Mohammad Saab and they fought in Karbala
to show that when it comes to fighting you

682
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:09,310
have 

683
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:33,700
to fight. So, onward Christian soldiers.

684
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:40,700
Question: Mother [UNCLEAR] when you give somebody

685
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:56,500
a blessing, or when You say: “I am [UNCLEAR],
I am [LOVE, NARADA], what do you come to [UNCLEAR]

686
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,500
on you.

687
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:34,500
Shri Mataji: I don’t say that, did I? [MISSING
