1
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:20,362
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

2
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,966
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

3
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:52,823
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

4
00:11:53,024 --> 00:12:05,824
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

5
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:16,728
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

6
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,704
of the Mother and Christ.

7
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:41,349
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

8
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,915
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

9
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,507
And when they could not explain it,

10
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:06,467
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

11
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:19,631
Even before Christ, they used to have

12
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,215
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

13
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:31,406
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

14
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:53,167
to worship what they call Yahovah.

15
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:05,155
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

16
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:17,979
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

17
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:24,732
She incarnated before also.

18
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:31,350
She incarnated as Sita,

19
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:38,849
and then She incarnated as Radha,

20
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:44,476
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

21
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,764
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

22
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:55,090
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

23
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:09,033
He was the son of Radha.

24
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:15,317
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

25
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:27,093
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

26
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:34,576
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

27
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:43,832
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

28
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,480
All the description about Jesus Christ

29
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:05,196
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

30
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:21,710
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

31
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,323
with immaculate conception,

32
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:30,617
which She had done before also, as Radha.

33
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:57,178
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

34
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:10,235
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

35
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,402
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

36
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:29,515
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

37
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,639
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

38
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:58,468
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

39
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:13,973
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

40
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:18,998
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

41
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:25,416
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

42
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:47,766
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

43
00:18:54,783 --> 00:19:03,671
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

44
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:17,145
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

45
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:26,575
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

46
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:32,875
because He is just vibrations.

47
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:43,514
So when you do puja to Me,

48
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:50,039
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

49
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,631
If they had done puja to Christ -

50
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:12,545
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

51
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:26,957
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

52
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:36,381
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

53
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,102
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

54
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:07,332
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

55
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,751
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

56
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:30,465
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

57
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:35,917
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

58
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:43,696
which is the swayambhu,

59
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:48,352
is created by the Mother Earth.

60
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:55,812
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

61
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:08,708
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

62
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:25,573
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

63
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:36,196
So I went to see that place

64
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:43,973
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

65
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:48,670
about say, five inches, at the most.

66
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:59,633
And the face was just like Mine,

67
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,741
exactly like Mine.

68
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:11,971
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

69
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:20,760
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

70
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:35,301
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

71
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:41,281
and they started following under a rock,

72
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:52,792
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

73
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,821
And in that light they walked,

74
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,207
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

75
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:08,381
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

76
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:27,290
So they worship that statue in that place.

77
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:36,935
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

78
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:44,894
as I give you vibrations,

79
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:48,487
but not so much

80
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,055
as I give you.

81
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,273
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

82
00:24:56,474 --> 00:25:00,413
who might be giving you vibrations.

83
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:08,047
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

84
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:11,804
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

85
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:16,452
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

86
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:29,961
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

87
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:34,839
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

88
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:49,950
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

89
00:25:56,287 --> 00:26:01,017
and there are many sweet water wells there.

90
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:06,752
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

91
00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:10,527
many people took photograph.

92
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:20,593
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

93
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:27,954
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

94
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:37,947
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

95
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:43,751
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

96
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:02,200
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

97
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:07,365
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

98
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,252
Same is the puja.

99
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:27,950
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

100
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:39,360
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

101
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:52,746
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

102
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,338
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

103
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:12,447
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

104
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:28,283
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

105
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:35,942
what powers He gives you.

106
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,758
When you praise those qualities,

107
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:45,835
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

108
00:28:56,545 --> 00:29:00,302
This is how the Divine works,

109
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:07,167
as if you get charged with those qualities.

110
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:17,478
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

111
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:28,982
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

112
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:37,776
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

113
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:43,075
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

114
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:50,789
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

115
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,348
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

116
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,919
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

117
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:19,942
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

118
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:34,233
It could not happen earlier,

119
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:43,975
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

120
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,932
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

121
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:59,094
that I look like you, I behave like you,

122
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,181
I have made Myself exactly like you -

123
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:05,498
very difficult to make, but I have.

124
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:30,858
And this body has to bear lots of things

125
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:40,796
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

126
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:54,922
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

127
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,901
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

128
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:03,138
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

129
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:08,666
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

130
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:12,306
and moving very fast.

131
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:29,155
Now I have to bear it.

132
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:34,465
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

133
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:47,090
Because He is very direct,

134
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:55,987
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

135
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:08,340
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

136
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:16,595
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

137
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:35,110
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

138
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:39,817
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

139
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:44,468
so I take time to take them out.

140
00:34:00,136 --> 00:34:02,564
So all these things are very symbolic,

141
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:07,777
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

142
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:18,788
And that symbol actually acts.

143
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:25,064
For example if you give somebody a flower,

144
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:30,071
 that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

145
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,725
and gratitude comes in.

146
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:48,544
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

147
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:57,037
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

148
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:13,922
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

149
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:17,135
and of their blessings on you.

150
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:22,142
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

151
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:34,973
That is how the Divine acts.

152
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:47,033
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

153
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:54,381
Now we are doing puja at this time,

154
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:58,661
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

155
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:06,205
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

156
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:24,707
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

157
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:27,602
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

158
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:32,875
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

159
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:36,085
Now they are getting the same blessings,

160
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:38,032
though you are doing the puja

161
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:43,012
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

162
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:08,873
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

163
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:12,457
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

164
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:16,981
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

165
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:22,126
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

166
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:44,418
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

167
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:50,211
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

168
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:02,413
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

169
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:08,127
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

170
00:38:19,603 --> 00:38:27,075
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

171
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:37,364
So you should be very relaxed about it.

172
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:43,418
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

173
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:48,494
May God bless you all.

174
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:56,827
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

175
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:59,953
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

176
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,398
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

177
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,531
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

178
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:09,120
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

179
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:14,403
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

180
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:20,059
The children have to wash the Feet

181
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,832
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.
