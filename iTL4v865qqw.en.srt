1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,250
I am overjoyed really today

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,291
to see you all here

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:13,750
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

4
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:19,542
We were to be in Portugal

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,709
but it was not so - so we are here.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,166
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

7
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,792
but extremely significant.

8
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,458
Firstly in Diwali,

9
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:44,875
the first day they buy something

10
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,375
for the family.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,542
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,417
an ornament for the wife

13
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,375
or something like that.

14
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:07,667
Because that is the day of housewife.

15
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,750
And that day is to be celebrated

16
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:19,667
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,625
As a result you know in India even now

18
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:30,542
housewives are very much respected.

19
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,709
Actually they are respected all over.

20
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:39,041
You will be amazed that even

21
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,291
in the protocol of the government

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,542
receptions anywhere

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,750
the wife is very important.

24
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,959
And where she is sitting,

25
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,500
what is her position is very important.

26
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:58,917
Even today

27
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:04,291
in the most modern and advanced countries also

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,375
they have a special respect for the housewife.

29
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,750
The housewife may not be educated,

30
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,125
she may be a very simple woman,

31
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,041
she may not be very modern.

32
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,792
There was an experience for Me:

33
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,291
in London we had a program

34
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,166
where we all were invited,

35
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:40,250
and the head of the delegation,

36
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,834
his wife was missing.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,999
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,166
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

39
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,000
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

40
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,333
She must be somewhere here.”

41
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,291
So just before starting

42
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:05,542
I went to the washing room

43
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,542
and I was surprised

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,542
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,667
I said, “What are you doing here?

46
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,625
They are all waiting for you outside.”

47
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:19,875
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

48
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,792
So I went out and I told them

49
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,625
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

50
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:27,000
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

51
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,291
“Is she the wife?”

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,458
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

53
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,375
“We thought she was some secretary.”

54
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,291
I said, “What made you think?”

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

56
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,667
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

57
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,166
and everybody thought

58
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,166
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

59
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,417
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

60
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:58,291
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

62
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,999
and not to dress up like a secretary

63
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:11,625
or somebody who is just in the office.

64
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,834
Because she is regarded as the highest -

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,375
whether you like it or not.

66
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,417
But she had permed her hair

67
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,250
and she has been to a very expensive place

68
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,792
for all decorations and everything.

69
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,041
And poor thing, when she arrived

70
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,875
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

71
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,291
That’s what it is.

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
So for a housewife,

73
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,125
she is the dignity of the household.

74
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,375
Not only that, but she is responsible

75
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:53,250
for the complete culture of that country,

76
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,667
complete culture of that country.

77
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,625
They represent the culture.

78
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,750
Like in India nowadays they have started

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,166
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

80
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,458
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

81
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,375
I haven’t seen anybody.

82
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,333
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

83
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,999
because the society is so strong

84
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,999
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

85
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,417
She has to be decent,

86
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,750
she has to be very dignified

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,709
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

88
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,750
On the contrary I would say,

89
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,625
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

90
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,792
His wife was absolutely uneducated

91
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,166
because Shastriji went to jail

92
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,542
and she couldn’t take her education -

93
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,208
very simple, ordinary woman.

94
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,959
And she went to France.

95
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,458
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

96
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,667
he was the president.

97
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,250
And his wife was another very simple woman.

98
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,166
So Shastriji told her

99
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,709
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

100
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,375
now you’ve become great friends.”

101
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,291
God knows she didn’t know French

102
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,125
and she didn’t know Hindi,

103
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,458
but somehow both of them became great friends,

104
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,458
on the level of housewives.

105
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:28,208
And when he warned her not to cry,

106
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,375
what happened that they started crying

107
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,125
when they had to leave.

108
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,750
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

109
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,041
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

110
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,667
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

111
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,999
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

112
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,000
collectivity of housewives

113
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,250
that has to work out.

114
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,041
They have common problems,

115
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,208
they have to face their children,

116
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,999
they have to look after the household,

117
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,792
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

118
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,999
with the housewives.

119
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,667
And the housewife also

120
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,333
knows all little, little things.

121
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:17,000
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

122
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,999
because they live in the air, I think.

123
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,000
So the women have more sense

124
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,000
in this respect, for small, small things

125
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,250
they are quite aware.

126
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,875
It’s very interesting sometimes,

127
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,375
the men commit mistakes

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,291
of such a great humor.

129
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,000
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

130
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,709
with all the problems of daily life.

131
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,792
On one side the woman,

132
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,667
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

133
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,083
On the other side she has to look after her family,

134
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,959
her children.

135
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,709
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

136
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,917
for the society.

137
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,959
She has to maintain the society.

138
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,583
In a country where women are sensible

139
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,125
and are matured,

140
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,583
you will be amazed that they become

141
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,000
extremely good families,

142
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,542
good societies and good children.

143
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,375
That’s why I must say,

144
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:34,583
India is a very good country of very good society.

145
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,500
This is come out of the housewives,

146
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,208
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

147
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:45,792
who have done all the work that is important

148
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,709
as far as the culture is concerned.

149
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:53,750
This kind of thing is very much in India

150
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,583
and with that, what you find

151
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:01,959
that the people respect,

152
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,125
respect the housewives.

153
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
So respecting the housewife

154
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:12,834
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

155
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,166
But that doesn’t mean that

156
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:21,125
the women should try to dominate and trouble

157
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,125
and fight with the husbands.

158
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:30,125
But it means a very important position

159
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,875
in the society, of a housewife.

160
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:40,625
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

161
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,667
But she too has to be a devi.

162
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,999
If you treat her like a doormat,

163
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,999
then children will never respect her.

164
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,750
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

165
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,208
the children won’t respect the mother

166
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,500
and there will be no impact

167
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,208
of the mother on the children.

168
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,750
As a result the children get wayward,

169
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,500
and in the societies or in the countries

170
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,750
where the mother is not respected,

171
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,041
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

172
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,291
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

173
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,000
So it’s very important that on this day

174
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,083
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

175
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,917
you have to buy something for your wife,

176
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,333
and you have to give her something as a present.

177
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:42,041
At least you should buy a little pot

178
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,417
or something that can be used in the kitchen

179
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,166
to show your respect to her.

180
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,625
In the families where mother is not respected

181
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:56,208
children become extremely troublesome

182
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,709
and the whole, their family also suffers -

183
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:03,166
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

184
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,333
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

185
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,375
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

186
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,333
In the presence of the children if they shout,

187
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:19,000
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

188
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:23,041
the children can never respect the mother.

189
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,542
It is something, a criminal thing to do

190
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,583
to women who are in the household

191
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,709
doing all the work for you,

192
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,625
looking after you, your family,

193
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,999
not demanding anything.

194
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,250
Only if you want to understand

195
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,125
how they can be troublesome,

196
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,542
is see them in the politics.

197
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,083
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

198
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,542
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

199
00:11:55,834 --> 00:12:00,625
Because their field is their house, their family.

200
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,166
If they are not respected in the family,

201
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,333
they get out of the family

202
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:09,375
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

203
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,875
Though she has to bear a lot,

204
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,542
she has to suffer a lot,

205
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,250
but in the family she must be respected.

206
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:24,417
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

207
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:30,417
Then the second day is the one where

208
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,291
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

209
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:43,000
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

210
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,291
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

211
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,333
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

212
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,125
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

213
00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:00,208
and it was impossible to kill him.

214
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,166
But then somehow or other,

215
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,125
with the advent of a special power

216
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,166
that this Narakasura was killed.

217
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,875
That was the another day, fourth day,

218
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,667
where Narakasura was killed.

219
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,333
They say that when he was killed,

220
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:25,208
the door of hell was closed.

221
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:29,166
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

222
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,625
But I am of the opinion

223
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,291
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

224
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Be in your beds

225
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:43,083
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

226
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,041
You should not bother about him.

227
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,041
“Naraka” means hell.

228
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,625
And from the hell

229
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:55,041
they extracted him and killed him.

230
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,583
The last one is the best,

231
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:01,792
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

232
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,875
and His brother Bharat.

233
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:09,542
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

234
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,417
And for fourteen years

235
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,291
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

236
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,542
He went in the forest

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,291
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,166
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

239
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,959
forest by His father

240
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,750
and his daughter-in-law;

241
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,542
also I mean it’s His own wife.

242
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,709
And also the brother, they went together

243
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,041
into great sufferings.

244
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,291
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

245
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,291
The child

246
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,041
that lived in the palaces

247
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,250
had to go in the forest

248
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,041
and live in terrible conditions,

249
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,083
when He was to be the king.

250
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,208
Was too much.

251
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:09,208
But Sita went with Him

252
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,000
and She supported Him

253
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,834
and ultimately it so happened that

254
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,750
Ravana came and took away Sita.

255
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,125
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

256
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,792
killed him and brought back His wife.

257
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,875
But when they came back

258
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,500
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

259
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,625
there was a big jubilation

260
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:43,083
and Bharat, His brother -

261
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,500
he was very much attached to his brother

262
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,750
and he ruled that country

263
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,166
with the paduka -

264
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:58,542
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

265
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,333
they use – of his brother.

266
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:05,041
He put it on the throne and ruled.

267
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,917
So that is how the Bharat milan-

268
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,542
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

269
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,875
is celebrated,

270
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,875
and that was the time He was crowned also

271
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,375
as the king.

272
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,000
So it is long time back,

273
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,583
thousands of years back

274
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,166
this thing has happened.

275
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,291
That jubilation is very significant

276
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
that the right king gets His own throne,

277
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,667
and He rules.

278
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,208
And all the injustice

279
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:37,875
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

280
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:42,250
has to be completely finished from His life.

281
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,166
And that’s why Diwali is important.

282
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:51,999
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

283
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,208
Because it is Her blessings

284
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,458
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

285
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,959
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

286
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,750
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

287
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,208
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

288
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,875
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

289
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,333
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

290
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,375
It doesn’t mean money,

291
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,667
not at all.

292
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,917
To worship money is wrong.

293
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,041
But what it means that

294
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,542
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

295
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,083
or the whatever prosperity with that -

296
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,667
should be very carefully spent,

297
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,709
because She is very mobile

298
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,834
and the money can slip out.

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,999
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

300
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,291
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

301
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,166
But if you want to spend,

302
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,542
you must spend it in the right way,

303
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,999
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

304
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:08,542
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

305
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,542
you must be knowing

306
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,875
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

307
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:16,750
She had four hands,

308
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,208
one hand was to give.

309
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,250
She is generous, She gives.

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,792
Like this She gives,

311
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,875
and with one hand She blesses.

312
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,750
These are Her two hands.

313
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:35,417
One is to give, and to bless the person.

314
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,417
Very important it is,

315
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,999
that when you give to somebody something,

316
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
you forget about it,

317
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,667
and you bless that person.

318
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,375
Not only you give money,

319
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,750
but also you bless that person.

320
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,041
The other two hands

321
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,250
have got two lotuses of pink color.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,375
Pink is the color of love.

323
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,750
And a person who has money

324
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,750
should have a house

325
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:16,083
which is full of love.

326
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,625
Any guest who comes in the house

327
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,959
should be respected.

328
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,959
He should be treated just like God.

329
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,583
In India you have noticed how

330
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,959
they think foreigners -

331
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
“foreigners” means God to them.

332
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,041
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

333
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,458
but in India is very respectable.

334
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,917
If you are a foreigner

335
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,208
means that you are God.

336
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:43,792
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

337
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,333
This is the reason,

338
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,750
this is the basic culture of India

339
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,291
that anybody who is a guest -

340
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,583
he may be anything -

341
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,917
if he is a guest

342
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,166
then he is to be treated like God.

343
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,208
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

344
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,625
If you are a foreigner

345
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:08,166
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

346
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,500
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

347
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,542
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,750
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

349
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:38,166
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

350
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,125
They look after each other

351
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,583
and they are beautifully collective.

352
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:49,667
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

353
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,458
is a house full of love.

354
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:56,999
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

355
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,291
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

356
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,125
and the beetle goes inside

357
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,333
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

358
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,999
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

359
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,999
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

360
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,542
But here what I find

361
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,999
in the world now, if you have money

362
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,999
you become yourself like a beetle.

363
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,750
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

364
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:30,750
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

365
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
It’s just surprising is

366
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,542
that money which should give them

367
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,500
the form of Lakshmi

368
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,041
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

369
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,250
they become like devils.

370
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:48,250
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

371
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,750
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

372
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,291
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

373
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,333
That means no pressure on anyone.

374
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,291
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

375
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,625
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

376
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,083
just on Her own She stands

377
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:16,750
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

378
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,542
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

379
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,792
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

380
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,542
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

381
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,917
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

382
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:36,250
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

383
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:40,333
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

384
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,792
and also funny ideas

385
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:48,208
of having a, something, very expensive things

386
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:53,333
and what you call the designers.

387
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:57,500
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

388
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,208
that they have come.

389
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:03,041
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

390
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,166
and all your money goes to waste.

391
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:12,125
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

392
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,083
such wasteful habits.

393
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,458
They don’t do anything which we can call as

394
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,375
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

395
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,583
So one has to remember

396
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:27,333
that when you want to give something to someone

397
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,333
do it with the full heart.

398
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,542
Such full heart that

399
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,250
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

400
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,750
You see, that should happen, otherwise

401
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,542
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

402
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,500
You see, they are very funny people, you know

403
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:51,125
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

404
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:56,208
But they try to give presents.

405
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:58,250
Like in Japan, if you go,

406
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,542
they’ll give you such a big present.

407
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,750
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

408
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:09,333
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

409
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,041
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

410
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,166
you will take two,

411
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:21,625
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

412
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,375
small little those matchsticks.

413
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,750
Start looking at them

414
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:30,709
“What this is, why such a big design?”

415
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,709
and very surprising.

416
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:37,458
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

417
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,875
When we went there, they told us

418
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:46,208
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

419
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,917
they would give us a present.

420
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,417
Now I said, “What is this?

421
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,333
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

422
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:55,417
So the lady who was translating, she said

423
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,999
“They think You are from a royal family.”

424
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,667
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

425
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,750
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

426
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,000
I said, “Really?”

427
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:11,875
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

428
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:16,166
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

429
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:19,792
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

430
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:24,917
Just imagine what ideas people have about

431
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,667
hairdressing and all that.

432
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,999
But in India or these places

433
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,500
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

434
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,542
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

435
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,500
Because we have many people who

436
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,166
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

437
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:52,041
and they wear their hairdress like that.

438
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,750
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

439
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:00,792
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

440
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,250
also the children pick up much more

441
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,208
then from the mother than from the father.

442
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:09,250
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

443
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,917
But actually the, all the refined things

444
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,375
are picked up from the mother.

445
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:18,834
So it is more for the ladies

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,959
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

447
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,625
Nowadays – I went to London

448
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,000
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

449
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,999
“What is the fashion now?”

450
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,625
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

451
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,834
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,250
See in India, if we have hair like this

453
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,375
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

454
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:46,500
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

455
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,917
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

456
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,750
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

457
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,875
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

458
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,458
And this now is quite common I find everybody

459
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,792
dignified ladies also,

460
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,709
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

461
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,417
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

462
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,083
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

463
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,125
But anybody who does anything

464
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,458
that should not be followed by women.

465
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,999
It’s very slavish.

466
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,667
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

467
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,959
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

468
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,709
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

469
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:27,166
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

470
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,500
Because you are independent.

471
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,709
You must stand on your own character.

472
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,709
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

473
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,583
Instead of ruining your faces

474
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,333
you should try to improve them

475
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,999
by your dignity, by your

476
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,500
understanding.

477
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,542
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

478
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,500
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

479
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,458
that what they have to understand,

480
00:27:56,667 --> 00:28:00,125
what they have to be, how they should be.

481
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,542
I have always told you

482
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,166
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

483
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,750
very much more than the man.

484
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,667
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

485
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,166
doesn’t matter so much.

486
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,625
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

487
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,750
And men, as it is, don’t know much

488
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,417
as you know that very well.

489
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,709
Poor things, you know,

490
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:26,792
they are

491
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,041
They are educated only in the universities.

492
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,917
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

493
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,917
they don’t know anything.

494
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:45,542
So one should not feel bad about it.

495
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,291
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

496
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,917
to see the way men make mistake and

497
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,583
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

498
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,834
and they don’t know anything!

499
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:03,792
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

500
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:05,208
You see, that’s his character.

501
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,959
It’s all right.

502
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,625
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

503
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,583
because he really doesn’t know anything!

504
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,792
Also in art.

505
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,834
I don’t think men know much about art,

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,333
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

507
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,041
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

508
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,333
wear all throughout.

509
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:47,542
Just one type of dresses they will make

510
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,875
and that they will make and wear throughout.

511
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,792
They don’t have any demand.

512
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,750
But women are artistic.

513
00:29:55,959 --> 00:30:00,458
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

514
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:04,041
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

515
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,875
Because they live with their saris that they make

516
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,709
during holidays and things like that.

517
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:13,208
So in India is not possible to introduce

518
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,500
all these dresses.

519
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,250
In the school maybe,

520
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:21,208
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

521
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,792
So the saris are still on

522
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:27,417
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

523
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,917
it’s so beautiful.

524
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,041
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

525
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,625
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

526
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,999
much more with the women, not with the men.

527
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,041
And so one should see that

528
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,125
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

529
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:50,750
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

530
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:55,792
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

531
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,333
that should be such.

532
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,542
But some of the ladies

533
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,875
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

534
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,291
in the household, very dictating.

535
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,125
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

536
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:13,417
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

537
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,041
I have known a person

538
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,083
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

539
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,333
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

540
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,667
He said, “Whenever I sit,

541
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,999
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

542
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:26,750
“Why?”

543
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:30,458
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

544
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,875
my wife will shout at me.”

545
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,250
I said, “Why?”

546
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:38,417
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

547
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,083
So she’s so particular.

548
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,959
I carry a newspaper always with me -

549
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,667
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

550
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,500
I said, “It’s too much.”

551
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:52,250
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

552
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:03,542
So very particular about the whole house

553
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,375
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

554
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,375
It’s even worse than a hospital.

555
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,208
So some women can be very particular about that

556
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:17,917
and very methodical, could be.

557
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,166
But normally women should be very loving

558
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,417
and extremely accommodating,

559
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:31,417
and also being friendly with all the family members,

560
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,458
with everyone.

561
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:38,542
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

562
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,166
We have a very large family,

563
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,959
so many brothers and sisters

564
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:48,166
and everybody one better than the other.

565
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,750
It is so remarkable that

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,041
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

567
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,625
or a kind of a fragrance

568
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:03,333
that shows an individual personality in them.

569
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:07,417
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

570
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,999
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

571
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:15,208
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

572
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:19,917
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

573
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,625
and very humorous.

574
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,250
And they were making fun of everything

575
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,875
and enjoying life.

576
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:32,291
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

577
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,208
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

578
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,250
but there were sixteen thousand people.

579
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,959
So how could we give these presents?

580
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,500
So the women took out their chains

581
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:47,166
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

582
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,999
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

583
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,125
and they were making fun of men,

584
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,291
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

585
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,333
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

586
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,625
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

587
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:08,458
and they are very spiritual-minded.

588
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:12,625
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

589
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:15,375
and will keep a dignity of her own

590
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:19,417
and will show by her every gesture

591
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,458
that she is spiritual.

592
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,375
This is something so sweet, you know.

593
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,041
As I was telling you, on one side

594
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,166
sometimes you feel

595
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,375
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

596
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,750
But in the same Japan when I went there,

597
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,667
I liked their tiles very much.

598
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,333
So they were building up something,

599
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,750
I liked the design of their tiles.

600
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,542
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

601
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,834
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

602
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,291
And on the ship a big load

603
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,709
of those tiles arrived.

604
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,166
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

605
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,750
I said, “How did you get it?”

606
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,500
He said, “They brought it to You.”

607
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:12,999
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

608
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,834
can you imagine?

609
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,083
So on one side it is

610
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,375
a way of expression,

611
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,667
on the other side is different.

612
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,375
So one should understand also.

613
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,291
When somebody gives you something

614
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,250
you should understand

615
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:36,000
what is the significance of that,

616
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,375
and not to feel bad about it.

617
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:42,625
The significance of that could be very much great,

618
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,375
you may not understand.

619
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:48,583
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

620
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,999
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

621
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,500
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

622
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,875
that it should be auspicious.

623
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:03,291
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

624
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,208
Like sometimes

625
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,834
I have seen little children out of mischief

626
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

627
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,583
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

628
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,500
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

629
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:18,208
so they are doing like that.

630
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,333
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

631
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,500
it will not please the Goddess.

632
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,125
So that has to be understood very well

633
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,999
that you should not try to insult

634
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:33,125
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

635
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,583
If you don’t know, you should find out

636
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,834
and do it properly.

637
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,625
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

638
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:45,041
But the greatest message of this is

639
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:51,125
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

640
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:56,999
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

641
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,250
and fair play.

642
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,917
And this was given to Him.

643
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,166
In the same way we have to feel

644
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:11,792
that our expression of gratitude,

645
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:18,959
our expression of love should be such that it should be

646
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:23,458
given to a person who is a symbol

647
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:26,709
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

648
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,250
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

649
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,375
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

650
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,875
But if you want to give, then you must give something

651
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,917
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

652
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,250
That is one of the lessons you should have

653
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:51,959
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

654
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,792
When He went into the village

655
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:57,750
and He found there was an old woman

656
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:03,667
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

657
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:07,750
And she was from the aboriginal

658
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:11,500
and she gave Him some

659
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,375
we call them “ber” - is something like

660
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:23,375
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

661
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:27,959
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

662
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:31,000
and all of them are very sweet.

663
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,375
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

664
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,333
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

665
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:41,125
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

666
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,250
So please have them.”

667
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,041
Immediately He took it.

668
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,750
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

669
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,417
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

670
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,709
if you have put something in the mouth

671
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,750
and then you want to give to somebody

672
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,208
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

673
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,834
But Shri Rama said

674
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,959
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

675
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,166
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

676
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,500
So His wife says

677
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:13,709
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

678
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:16,291
this thing, You must give Me.”

679
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,834
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

680
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,959
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

681
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:28,208
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

682
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,458
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

683
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,542
She said, “Just now you were saying

684
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,667
all kinds of things against this lady.

685
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,250
Why do you want to have it?”

686
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,375
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

687
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,583
So, see, it shows

688
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:45,792
that Shri Rama could see her love,

689
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:49,999
her vibrations in those fruits

690
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,041
that she had offered.

691
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,417
And He could appreciate

692
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,959
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

693
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,375
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

694
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,959
This is what it is.

695
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:06,500
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

696
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:08,500
If you do it with love,

697
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:12,542
you will be able to make it auspicious.

698
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,999
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

699
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,083
then it is useless.

700
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:26,083
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

701
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:31,417
person like Shri Ram,

702
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,583
and to such a great incarnation.

703
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:40,458
She just thought of her love

704
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,709
and she gave it to Him.

705
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:46,500
In the same way you have to be very simple,

706
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:51,959
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

707
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,959
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

708
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,500
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

709
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,125
and a very prosperous new year.

710
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:07,542
May God bless you all.

711
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,750
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

712
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:57,667
That is, when you understand

713
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:02,125
the value of money

714
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,333
and when you are saturated

715
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,959
and you are fed up.

716
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,250
From inside you get detached,

717
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:20,125
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

718
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,959
that is Mahalakshmi.

719
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:27,083
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

720
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,125
which is the spiritual awakening.

721
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:34,875
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

722
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,875
this desire started

723
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:42,667
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

724
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,375
and that’s how you are all here.

725
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:50,000
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

726
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,709
that you were seeking the truth.

727
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,667
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

728
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,667
So this Mahalakshmi

729
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,625
is very important for you also.

730
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:06,250
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

731
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,333
which came out of the Mother Earth.

732
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:12,750
But they themselves didn’t know that

733
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:19,375
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

734
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:22,375
“O Ambe, awaken.”

735
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,333
Ambe is the Kundalini.

736
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:28,583
So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang?

737
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,250
You can understand that, why

738
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:35,000
in that temple they started singing

739
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:39,166
the song of “Jogawa” by which to raise the Kundalini.
