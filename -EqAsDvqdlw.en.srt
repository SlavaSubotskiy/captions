00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,880
Public Program  25 April 2001
 Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:05,632
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,981
I have been coming the Turkey in the last ten years.

4
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:30,771
And how this place is so much filled with spirituality.

5
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:40,381
 Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here,

6
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,357
must be something in this country
that there were so many Sufis were created.

7
00:00:55,126 --> 00:01:00,075
And I have read about them and
I have read about Rumi and all of others.

8
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:06,449
 And I find they described the qualities of the Sufi

9
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:10,828
 the state of his mind, very beautiful.

10
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:34,602
But they didn't say how created, how to become Sufi.

11
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:45,973
They described ofcourse  very well and absolutely  truthfully

12
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:50,134
 whatever was the achievement.

13
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:03,857
But nobody could say that how they achieved it.

14
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:18,271
Even in the Kuran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described

15
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:24,851
 that he went to seventh heavens  on a white horse.

16
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,261
 He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic.

17
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:46,508
The white horse was this Kundalini.

18
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:54,937
 The more you will know about Kundalini
you will see how poetically.

19
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:59,906
He has described all these seven heavens he called also.

20
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,663
So, unless and until you are a self realized soul

21
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,671
as he has said `know thy self.

22
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:29,119
Unless and until you know your self
you can not understand any one of scriptures.

23
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:52,110
They say , all of them say they same thing in different ways
 and also in poetic.

24
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,172
And it is difficult for common people to understand.

25
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:22,715
In no way there is difference in the explanation
 of all these scriptures,

26
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,493
they are just the same.

27
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:39,655
Then there is no question of people fighting

28
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:43,694
because there is no difference  what they are kind of all.

29
00:04:53,881 --> 00:05:00,703
But the problem was one individual gets self realization

30
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:05,411
and the others don’t understand and they torture them [UNCLEAR].

31
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,602
As you know Christ was crucified

32
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:25,003
and all the saints, all the sages were tortured.

33
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:40,378
Even in China there was this Tao.

34
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:43,379
It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga

35
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:47,184
but it was written in such a manner

36
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:53,365
that people could not understand it or
I think couldn't take it what it was written.

37
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:14,545
Also I am find  in Japan,Vidittama is
the deciple of mahatma welcome book.

38
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,810
he said the same thing,

39
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:22,589
he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through
various methods

40
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:27,079
all was nothing but kundalini awakening.

41
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:59,365
Now the thing this of understanding
then go to any limit of stupities.

42
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:13,711
There was a great poet called Kabir in India

43
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:25,176
and whatever he told was so much
 misunderstood by people

44
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:31,459
that you can not imagine
 what interpretations they do.

45
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:51,810
He says in one  poetry that my beloved
went away and  I never  didn't  cry.

46
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:05,465
Now people think beloved means a lover.

47
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:10,397
It is what he was meaning was a life that life went away.

48
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,357
But, I did not, try,   I didn't say anything.

49
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:28,013
So he was saying about the death

50
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,996
 while people all these things it is some sort of
a beloved he is talking about.

51
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,680
Thus you see, we have problems, all people fighting

52
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:54,641
 who said they are fighting is a name of religion.

53
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:10,313
To understand they have  first you get your self realization.

54
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,982
You have to know yourself.

55
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:22,756
Unless and until you know yourself

56
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:27,841
how we do understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward.

57
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:46,825
So whatever they have told you about the Kundalini it is a fact,

58
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:51,603
it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone.

59
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,718
You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu you could be a Christian anything.

60
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,760
Even people from Africa came.

61
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:16,957
They were black, some were white, some were yellow,

62
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:21,343
all of them have got this Kundalini within them.

63
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,237
I has,  God has created us the same.

64
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,592
we all have noses, hands everything,
 everywhere whatever languages we may speak.

65
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you".

66
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:07,341
The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the ruh.

67
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:23,546
You all have this right

68
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,330
and now it is going to work out

69
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:30,901
that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening.

70
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:47,561
All this may be not written in those books.

71
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:50,188
Perhaps that was not the time to write

72
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:55,099
or maybe these books were written after long time

73
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:58,674
 after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that.

74
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:02,210
So there are certain sacrifice you see.

75
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:25,285
But it is a fact that, you whole have,
all of you have this power within you,

76
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,909
this energy within you which we call as Kundalini.

77
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:41,571
It has been proved now

78
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,001
because wherever I have gone many country

79
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:49,991
various type of people was there
 and they all got their realization.

80
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:04,218
Especially in Turkey is a dear country to me

81
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:08,516
because of so many people who were here

82
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:13,248
and  who  were  spiritually so equipped

83
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:17,882
they might call themselves  sufis,
 I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR].

84
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,599
So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising

85
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:39,469
 cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies.

86
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,090
Because it connects you

87
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:59,309
to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh

88
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,685
and all your personality absolutely
get absorbed with the truth.

89
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,653
The first thing that happens to you when she rises,

90
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:32,737
sometimes it is just  bloom thoughtlessly aware.

91
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:48,472
The thoughts come to us because we react.

92
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:52,779
We see something immediatly we react.

93
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:09,853
We react according to our ego or maybe
 according to our conditioning.

94
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:23,581
But when the Kundalini she rises and
crosses this center upward

95
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:26,322
then your thoughts stop.

96
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,762
Then you become a witness.

97
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,986
You witness without thinking.

98
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,925
Thoughts rises then falls

99
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,786
 then another thought comes up, rises and falls.

100
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,505
There is a space, very little space in between

101
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,152
but we cannot see that space,

102
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,859
we can not in there  that space .

103
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:35,759
Now these thoughts who are all the time nearly how enter  in the head

104
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:38,721
and a mine cruise or jumping on them

105
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,051
doesn’t allow us to be in the present

106
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:45,960
because they come from past and from the future.

107
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:10,280
So we cannot be in the present.

108
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:19,298
Past is finished it does not exist
and the future is no more,

109
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:24,296
so what we have to do is to stay in the present.

110
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:40,313
And in the present is reality, is the truth.

111
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,297
That is how we can not enjoying.

112
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:58,939
For example, I see a very good for carpet here, very beautiful

113
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,348
and I start reacting on it

114
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:06,830
and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost,

115
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,763
can I have it, all things is possible.

116
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,316
but I can not watch it.

117
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,266
Because I can not watching

118
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:33,952
the joy that  is put by the artist  in decide
I can not enjoy it.

119
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,724
So when this Kundalini rises

120
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:53,883
what she does,  she elongates looks that,
 there is a space   between a  thought.

121
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:10,735
So we can see everything without thinking and enjoyable.

122
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:24,315
And with this enjoyment we get peace,

123
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,350
complete peace.

124
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:38,986
We do not agress others, we enjoy others.

125
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,911
They are many peace conferences

126
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:55,032
but those who are having the conference have no peace within –

127
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:57,955
then what is the use to have these conferences?

128
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:13,146
We have six enemies within us at least

129
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:15,767
which are all the time torturing us.

130
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,132
They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully

131
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,565
but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

132
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,944
First is the anger.

133
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:48,195
That is so common,

134
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,237
 comes out of  so much of conditioning

135
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:53,589
may be so much of ego.

136
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:05,174
Then the perversion,

137
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:11,948
perversion of sex or
 all kinds of dirty things people do it.

138
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Then we have false pride,

139
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,286
now we have jealousy

140
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,420
we have attachments.

141
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:45,665
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

142
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,478
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

143
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,044
And we have  also attraction.

144
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,998
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

145
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:13,050
  say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

146
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,226
attractions.

147
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,127
We cannot explain.

148
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:38,159
We cannot explain why we do that.

149
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:47,182
Why we suffer from all these enemies we do not know.

150
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:57,313
Once you become the spirit,

151
00:22:57,338 --> 00:23:00,839
spirit drops out everything,

152
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:03,719
it is so clear, so clean,

153
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:08,297
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

154
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:27,310
The spirit , that is within you.

155
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:33,316
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

156
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:38,261
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

157
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:55,188
What, actually what happens is

158
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,738
that when the Kundalini rises

159
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:02,514
your spirit start emit vibrations

160
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,262
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

161
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:25,043
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

162
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,912
out of your fontanel bone area.

163
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:46,095
And then this  fingers which represent

164
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:51,008
the centers within you  start speaking telling you
 what's wrong and what's kind.

165
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:12,790
Also they tell you about others, what is wrong with the others.

166
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,724
This connection with the divine
gives you the blessing

167
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:29,392
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

168
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,422
Even the doctors will not tell you,

169
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:50,773
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

170
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:07,327
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
 your hands will speak.

171
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:19,104
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

172
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:21,353
[UNCLEAR]

173
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:22,941
They are not  in Kıyama

174
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:32,464
Now because this is the last judgement.

175
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:42,839
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

176
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:49,584
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

177
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:54,231
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

178
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:09,014
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

179
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,818
and tell you about you and others.

180
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,817
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

181
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:34,979
If your hands do not speak

182
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:38,070
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

183
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:48,353
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

184
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:53,176
but once you be  able to read it after you have got your realization.

185
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,779
It is high time that you should realize

186
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:10,384
that we  have been following something so much

187
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,870
and why is  we are in trouble,

188
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:17,989
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

189
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,938
It is something missing

190
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:38,617
that so far we have not been able to

191
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,111
achieve what is doing promised .

192
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:08,956
You all can have your self realization.

193
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:17,162
Don’t have any fear about it and some

194
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:20,141
sort of funny ideas about it.

195
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:31,974
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

196
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:41,083
It`s not something imaginary.

197
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:47,571
It’s the actualization.

198
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:55,864
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

199
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:09,472
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

200
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:11,917
to have that self realization.

201
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:25,564
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

202
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,220
And so, you on deserved.

203
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:35,911
And you should have it.

204
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,973
Because İt is what  is promise.

205
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:50,084
So ultimately what happens

206
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:53,079
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

207
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:02,498
You become powerfull.

208
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,495
But you don't have ego.

209
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:14,213
And you know how you get help others

210
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,499
and yourself and help your family.

211
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,253
All of you can  it.

212
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:38,500
I mean those who want can all  getting it, can't be force
[UNCLEAR].

213
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:53,702
This you will know what you are and also what othes are.

214
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:05,878
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

215
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,021
We also have a hospital in India.

216
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:24,603
Where people are cured without any medicine
 with the own vibrations.

217
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:39,638
Moreover mentally [UNCLEAR] so many people who have been cured.

218
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:49,484
And your problems are solved.

219
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,111
Because you get out  of your problems.

220
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:07,601
Will be amazed how miraculously
 you achieve such found [UNCLEAR]  things.

221
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:10,660
which really  [UNCLEAR]   to begin with.

222
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,587
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

223
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:36,839
All negative forces and energy just drop out of run away.

224
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:50,279
Just like whether light comes in all darkness [UNCLEAR].

225
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:58,602
It sometimes  people don't believe.

226
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:03,344
Because, they don't think they are
 capable get of getting self realization.

227
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:18,392
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

228
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:30,260
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

229
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:35,212
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

230
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:50,284
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

231
00:34:55,363 --> 00:35:04,167
You have once you have what only I have to open the window.

232
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:14,970
That to you do because İt is your desire,

233
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,805
become your pure desire to be.

234
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:31,219
Otherwise no other desires pure.

235
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:42,936
All economics impasse, normal point
 that know human desire is complete.

236
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,202
Today you want  to have one thing then
 you want to have another thing.

237
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:07,045
And you are never satisfied.

238
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,818
But this  is pure desire.

239
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:18,885
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
 because the desire of our almighty

240
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:31,225
So, when you get your realization,

241
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:37,078
 you feel absolutely satisfied and enjoy whatever you have.

242
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:52,243
And also you enjoy others and their things

243
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:56,459
without thinking that they don't belong you.

244
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,646
You whole panorama changes

245
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:18,709
and you become a very universal personality.

246
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:28,869
You really become global

247
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:34,306
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

248
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:53,148
I'll give an example that
 Palestinians were fighting Israelis

249
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:57,970
And one of the Israeli fellow, he phoned  to me

250
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:05,277
that mother we have some sahaj yogis
 in the on of the villages of  Palestine.

251
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:23,563
They were friends,  despite the fact in
 Palestine  fighting can't this your fighting.

252
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:27,307
But they were sahaja yogis,
 so they were friens their friends

253
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:48,489
So this is really knew that
 they are going to drop a big bomb

254
00:38:48,553 --> 00:38:53,135
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention mother

255
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:55,853
 I don't  for people to be kill there.

256
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:15,043
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb

257
00:39:20,707 --> 00:39:24,881
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

258
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:33,522
We have never used it.

259
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:38,793
We have always use hatred  rule over power others.

260
00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:50,534
We have never used love.

261
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:59,950
There is divine love all human all over the world
 that's why we are existing .

262
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:10,167
You have to just become one within that's all.

263
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:20,731
It's all over, it is called Ruh , It's all over.

264
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:23,209
But we have not yet felt.

265
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:35,638
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

266
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,858
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

267
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:47,398
do  just for automatically.

268
00:40:57,403 --> 00:41:00,140
Have faith in your self.

269
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,528
Do not condemn yourself.

270
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,100
This will change the whole world.

271
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:17,353
Once they realize that there is divine love 
 which you gives us.

272
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:33,049
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

273
00:41:33,082 --> 00:41:40,546
and the second stage is what is called
 as the doubtless awareness.

274
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,577
That state comes to people automatically

275
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:03,955
and sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

276
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:21,097
It doesn't give you any doubt anymore  
you are sure  this is what it is.

277
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,938
Today somebody came to see me

278
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,457
he used to perspiration  too cold.

279
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:41,542
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

280
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:44,177
to  look working very hard.

281
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:01,482
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

282
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:03,308
and his perspiration stopped.

283
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,796
So I told him that you should forgive,

284
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:21,459
forgive others and that worked.

285
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:35,137
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

286
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,707
 or that why  death can the for heart.

287
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,566
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

288
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:08,685
So all those who want to have their self realization

289
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,884
please stay on  hall.

290
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:12,916
If you don't want to have
to leave  the  hall.

291
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:28,880
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

292
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:38,601
There are many false people who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

293
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,399
only thing is you must claim to your self realization.

294
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:57,954
So that you all become Sufis.

295
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:04,121
You do not have to give up anything.

296
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:07,631
Or you don’t have to become an ascetic,

297
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,461
and I am a married  woman,

298
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:21,179
I have for  children, I have for  grandchildren
 and I have got  their grandchildren .

299
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:32,441
But I am what I am.

300
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:38,869
That’s what should happen to you.

301
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:45,481
So again I would request

302
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:49,762
those who don’t want have  their self realization to  leave the hall.

303
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,315
Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

304
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:05,062
Now  close your eyes.

305
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:08,821
Please close.

306
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:18,672
See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips

307
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:44,700
Now please open your eyes,

308
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,593
put your left hand towards me

309
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:49,466
and put the right hand

310
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:55,926
bend your head and put the right hand
 agaisnt the fontenella bone area

311
00:46:55,942 --> 00:46:58,809
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

312
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,895
See if you this better  on the left hand,

313
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:24,446
little it should be above the head not on the top,

314
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:29,998
bend your head and see for yourself.

315
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:32,231
Move your hand and see for yourself.

316
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,746
Now please put your right hand towards me,
