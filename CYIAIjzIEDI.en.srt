1
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:28,492
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

2
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:36,695
was planned in such a manner. Because
He was to be born

3
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:43,422
in a place, it was very humble, very humble
place.

4
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:49,484
Because He came to teach us humility.

5
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:57,547
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

6
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:09,326
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
you activate within us humility.

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:16,493
Actually He came on this earth first
of all,

8
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:24,889
to create a space within us, at the Agnya
chakra,

9
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:33,545
by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles
of the ego.

10
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,459
He had to talk of humility that time,

11
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:48,186
because Romans were ruling and they were
very arrogant, very crude,

12
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:54,029
uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say,
not at all evolved.

13
00:01:56,252 --> 00:02:03,475
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

14
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:09,216
because when you have somebody as an ideal
before you

15
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:17,201
and always people see who dominates them
and then such person becomes their ideal.

16
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:23,100
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

17
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:32,404
In those circumstances, Christ was born.
But He was not only born

18
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:37,147
just for Romans or for anyone, but He was
born for the whole world.

19
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:42,451
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

20
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:48,167
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

21
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:54,506
And that demarcated the way human beings
were going on.

22
00:02:54,707 --> 00:03:01,170
So they had to be controlled, first of all,

23
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:10,756
and Christ had to come at a time where
a balance was to be established.

24
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,948
So the first thing that was said about
Christ throughout in all these music

25
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:23,615
and songs you have heard now is that
‘Peace on Earth.’

26
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:30,873
He came to create peace on earth.

27
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:38,764
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

28
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:44,709
secondly, when you are realized. Both
things should be there.

29
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,162
If only you get your realization and there
is no balance in you, there cannot be peace.

30
00:03:52,363 --> 00:04:00,607
But peace never means in any way is
a personality that recedes back,

31
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:05,217
runs away from situations, escapists,

32
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:10,868
which does not want to face the reality,
never means that.

33
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:18,053
Christ is pictured very differently from
what He was.

34
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:25,157
He was the strongest personality...,
and the healthiest man...

35
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:33,134
and He would not stand any nonsense, nobody
could take liberties with Him.

36
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:37,798
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

37
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:44,509
Extremely compassionate, extremely kind 
but very powerful.

38
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,868
This is the balance.

39
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:55,806
So He came on this earth to create peace
within our minds.

40
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:59,853
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

41
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:02,782
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

42
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:09,876
When is this peace going to be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

43
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,290
Human beings are violent to each other.

44
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:20,540
Ego developed subtler ways and subtler
ways,

45
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:27,901
then provocative ways started coming up
also from the superego.

46
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:33,675
Sly methods from the superego. The conflict
started.

47
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:46,416
And at that time, to overcome that
conflict, the best thing was

48
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:53,174
to create a space in Agnya, in the center,
in thoughtless awareness.

49
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:58,393
That’s how Christ had to come on this
earth.

50
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,776
The birth is very, very symbolic.

51
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:15,041
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya, He’s
nothing but the Word as you call it,

52
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:20,432
Logos, I don’t know what all words you
have got in language.

53
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:25,104
The Shabda as they call it, the Omkara.

54
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:31,901
He was to be born in this way because
He had no body.

55
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:40,854
And the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

56
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:49,627
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

57
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:56,073
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger for people, just look at this.

58
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:04,667
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort,

59
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:10,309
can there be a comfort in a manger? Think
like that.

60
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,231
All the Christian nations are after their
comforts.

61
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,458
Aren’t we?

62
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:26,278
What we think is not comfortable, should be
comfortable.

63
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,568
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages

64
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,300
of Christ’s birth.

65
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:40,525
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ.

66
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,295
Because He was born in a manger.

67
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:49,118
No comfort was provided for Him.

68
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:57,248
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

69
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,701
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

70
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:08,162
Copying Him is not the way. Is not the way
by copying Him that you will become Christ

71
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,465
but by imbibing His qualities within you.

72
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,871
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

73
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:21,340
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth, be
happy about it, sing songs,

74
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,762
go into a mood like that, but really I tell
you

75
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,777
it’s a very symbolic thing for all of us

76
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:34,644
to know that He slept, in a manger.

77
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,417
What about Christ within us?

78
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:46,208
You’re not going to be happy with yourself,

79
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:50,108
with your being, with your Spirit,

80
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:57,005
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

81
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,021
You yourself you’re not going to enjoy.

82
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:11,677
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

83
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:19,349
to create the peace on earth. We have to be
peaceful,

84
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:27,937
to be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

85
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:33,888
If you become humble peace will come.

86
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,145
Humble is a good word, I don’t know if
it explains what it means.

87
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:46,966
Humble means not asking for your own
comfort but comfort of others.

88
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:54,052
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

89
00:09:54,253 --> 00:10:05,721
So Christ who is the present Christ, today,
who is born in you, is to be looked after,

90
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:11,616
is not the Christ of the Bible, but
a Christ of your heart,

91
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:16,111
which is born within you is to be looked
after.

92
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:25,389
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

93
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,133
for people to understand it, it’s too
symbolic for you,

94
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:38,422
but, at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand it,

95
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,130
so one has to only understand through your
own Spirit,

96
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:48,416
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

97
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,000
May God bless you.
