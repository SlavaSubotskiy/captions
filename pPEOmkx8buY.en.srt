1
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,208
May God bless you.

2
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,959
Please be seated.

3
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,709
(Just to record, hmm?)

1
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:52,377
It’s such a pleasure to be in the ashram in San Diego.

2
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,454
And it’s such a beautiful place,

3
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:00,944
so much expressing the love of God,

4
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:07,412
the Divine, the way it wants to help you at every step.

5
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
If you want to have an ashram,

6
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,329
if you want to have a proper place,

7
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:15,454
you want to look after your children well,

8
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:19,537
you want to do God’s work,

9
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:21,661
everything is looked after,

10
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:24,745
everything has to be worked out.

11
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,619
If it is not worked out,

12
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,412
then how will you do your work?

13
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,911
So, it all works out.

14
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,995
And it’s so obvious, the way we have different ashrams,

15
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,579
such comfortable places

16
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:45,661
at a very reasonable amount that we can afford,

17
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,911
that we can live happily together.

18
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:53,745
This is the abode created by love for you.

19
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,078
So, the first thing we have to remember,

20
00:02:56,537 --> 00:03:00,661
that among ourselves we should have complete love.

21
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:09,162
We should not trust people who try to

22
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,162
divide us,

23
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:16,287
who try to give us wrong ideas.

24
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:21,203
It’s very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja yogi

25
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,661
from the heart.

26
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,245
It’s very easy to make out.

27
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,329
You have to be a little more sensitive

28
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:30,120
and you’ll find out such a person very easily.

29
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:34,579
Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered.

30
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,245
Nobody can act against God now,

31
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,245
because everything will be discovered and will be found out.

32
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:46,745
But we have to have our attention fully

33
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,995
on your Mother.

34
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,953
But some people do get little more fanatic

35
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,203
because they are so attached, doesn’t matter,

36
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:58,579
you’ll come round.

37
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:02,037
But is better to be fanatic than to be doubting.

38
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:07,745
So those people who do things little over,

39
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:11,661
should commit to a life

40
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,953
that whatever they see,

41
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,287
whatever they understand in Sahaja Yoga,

42
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,412
whatever happens, they will accept it

43
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,828
without any anxiety about it.

44
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:26,619
This is the point, that we build up

45
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,620
our images about Sahaja Yoga also.

46
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:32,412
We cannot build up – it is what it is.

47
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,203
We cannot build up our image

48
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,745
that we think Sahaja Yoga should be like this,

49
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,661
Sahaja Yoga should be like that – it cannot be.

50
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:42,953
You cannot compromise, you just cannot compromise.

51
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:45,120
It has to be what it is.

52
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:48,412
It cannot be anything that you want it to be.

53
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:53,579
You cannot mould it, because it is fixed long time back.

54
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:56,287
Now it is what it is,

55
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,037
and that is why it is working out so well, so efficiently.

56
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,329
But to make it more efficient

57
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:06,370
you have to accept its working.

58
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:09,745
Like yesterday’s timings, you see:

59
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:11,995
I knew there must be something,

60
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,911
and the time was not yet ready.

61
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:17,911
The time I spent here

62
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,745
would have been spent raising their kundalini,

63
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,162
unnecessarily wasted.

64
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,579
Instead of that, five minutes I took,

65
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,870
it took Me to give them realization.

66
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,828
So, it’s, everything has to be understood in that light.

67
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:38,037
Gradually you will start seeing the divine play,

68
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,120
how things work out,

69
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,120
how it helps you.

70
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:47,828
But supposing God has brought

71
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,745
something before you.

72
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,745
Dr. Worlikar told Me a nice story about this

73
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:57,162
which is very interesting,

74
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,828
that between the Goddess of wealth

75
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:04,828
and the Goddess of education there was a little conflict.

76
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:09,162
You can say education or the Saraswati,

77
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,703
which if neglected

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,911
or if too much adored can make you egoistical,

79
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,162
in the sense that if you become a person

80
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,162
who is after learning, learning, learning,

81
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,162
you can be thrown on the other side.

82
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:32,412
So, this lady wanted to test the power of wealth.

83
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:35,245
So, She said to the Laksmi that

84
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,786
“All right, let’s see, on this person.”

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,495
This person was a beggar, he needed money,

86
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,537
and very much.

87
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,287
So, Laksmi put lot of money in a big utensils,

88
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,745
what we call handa,

89
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,495
and put it in his way.

90
00:06:55,911 --> 00:07:00,078
This fellow was walking,

91
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,953
so Saraswati entered into his mind.

92
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,620
As soon as Saraswati enters into the mind

93
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:10,619
he became egoistical, and he didn’t even look at that,

94
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,162
he just walked off.

95
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,370
That was his need, but he walked off.

96
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:20,037
So it suggests one thing, that when people become egoistical,

97
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,037
start making their own plans,

98
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:27,287
start making their own suggestions and images they form,

99
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:32,495
then what happens that the Divine,

100
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,911
which is trying to supply for your need,

101
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:41,078
for your wants, for your solutions, disappears.

102
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,703
This is what happens,

103
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:48,245
that we do not allow the Divine to have its play.

104
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,828
This is not only on material level;

105
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,537
it is true also on emotional level,

106
00:07:53,911 --> 00:08:00,370
it is true also on our physical level,

107
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,162
but the best of all

108
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:07,245
that it is true about spiritual level also.

109
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,953
So we should not miss the point.

110
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:13,537
Let the Divine play its role, and we should be able to see.

111
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,412
Like Krishna has said, “Karmanyevadikaraste”

112
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,703
– “It is our job to do the job.”

113
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:22,454
Now we’ve done the puja, aarti’s done.

114
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,412
I said, “All right, if we can do it, all right;

115
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,619
if we cannot, I’ll go by the evening plane.”

116
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,786
I am not bothered, whether I go by morning plane

117
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,745
or evening plane doesn’t matter.

118
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,619
I’m absolutely relaxed.

119
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,412
We discussed certain important points had to be discussed,

120
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,329
some time had to be spent;

121
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:43,329
that has to be done, that’s part of our life.

122
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,579
So I’m not anxious that I should go by one o’clock plane.

123
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,661
All right, I’ll go by the night plane,

124
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:49,870
makes no difference to Me.

125
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:55,120
So just to have a very relaxed mind,

126
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:58,454
to watch how things come forward.

127
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,245
People unnecessarily –

128
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,619
Now when we understand

129
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,245
that the Divine is having its complete play,

130
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,911
its own working,

131
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,870
the whole thing is working for us,

132
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:35,870
for you, the Sahaja yogis.

133
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:37,911
Once you realize that,

134
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,412
then you feel absolutely relaxed and you are in joy.

135
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,329
But when you start,

136
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,661
“Oh, this should have been like this,

137
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,037
that should have been like this,”

138
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:53,245
then everything is against joy.

139
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:56,745
Whichever way it comes is all right.

140
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,828
Once you develop that attitude,

141
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:02,162
then the joy will be complete.

142
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,745
I have seen in emotional life also

143
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:07,329
if you people suffer too much.

144
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:11,870
The reason is, for everything you start thinking.

145
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:16,579
Now in India, how we get married is very simple, you see.

146
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:21,120
From childhood we are taught that “You’ll be married,

147
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,454
so you must learn how to live with your husband,”

148
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,412
and a man is always told how to treat your wife.

149
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,786
But they don’t know who is the wife and the husband.

150
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:35,619
But the husband and wife is just a sort of a symbol.

151
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:37,537
They don’t know which one it is;

152
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,661
just could be anyone.

153
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:42,953
So, once you accept her as a dharma,

154
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,745
it comes as a surprise to you, and just enjoy.

155
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,579
And the whole thing is built up to a point,

156
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,620
to a moment which has to be auspicious also.

157
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,745
Of course, they consult the horoscopes,

158
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:57,037
that’s an important part,

159
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,495
because horoscopes if you don’t consult,

160
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:00,953
could be quite disastrous.

161
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,828
So, they consult the horoscopes.

162
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,329
And if there are so many points

163
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:07,619
– they say twenty-six points is ideal

164
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,037
– then they get married, otherwise they don’t.

165
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:17,454
Now it’s not necessary that we do not meet or we meet.

166
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:21,120
Sometimes the people meet, talk to each other for one year,

167
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,745
may be that their marriages are postponed,

168
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
there’s no auspicious time.

169
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,661
They get some time to be together,

170
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,620
but never in private;

171
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,703
they never go into privacy.

172
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,703
So that moment is kept as sacred moment,

173
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,579
when you are going to meet your husband or wife

174
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,495
– that’s a very sacred moment,

175
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,995
so you are concentrated on that point.

176
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,454
So suddenly it is decided.

177
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,162
Now, you keep that moment as sacred moment.

178
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:55,579
Even sometimes it happens that you get some time in between,

179
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,619
quite a lot, after decision;

180
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:01,037
could be that you have to continue

181
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,703
as a feeling, seeing that person.

182
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,287
But then you do not divert your attention,

183
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,745
it’s completely concentrated effort.

184
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:14,203
It clicks, because you just accept it.

185
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:17,495
But here people live together for three years,

186
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,329
then they marry and divorce.

187
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:22,203
I mean I can’t understand, even if three years you live,

188
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:23,953
seven years you live, ten years they live,

189
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:25,245
still they do the same.

190
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,245
So, what’s the use of knowing each other for so many years,

191
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,412
still you divorce?

192
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,995
But it just clicks if you understand that

193
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,703
it’s a concentrated movement

194
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,911
where you have everything concentrated,

195
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,911
and you just meet the person and accept that person

196
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,911
as your companion.

197
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,537
Maybe one or two fail, but if you don’t think about it,

198
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:48,995
it won’t fail so much.

199
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,786
Because after marriage you start thinking,

200
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:54,537
“Oh I expected this, I expected that.

201
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,786
I thought this would be so; that’s not so.”

202
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:00,786
And always trying to find fault with another,

203
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,162
not with yourself – that’s the best part of it;

204
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
not seeing that how you are adjusting to that person.

205
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,162
Once you start thinking about marriage,

206
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,828
marriage is finished, already done with.

207
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:19,162
As a child is born to you, without thinking

208
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,911
what sort of a child is going to come, you love the child,

209
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,911
in the same way in the marriage

210
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,162
you’ll have to develop that kind of a concentrated feeling.

211
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,329
Then only marriages will be successful.

212
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,995
But here, you see, like when you purchase something,

213
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,870
you buy something, all right,

214
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,370
then you think, “Oh, it was not good,

215
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,037
I should have bought something else,

216
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:42,537
would have been better,” this, that.

217
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,786
So, you go to another thing.

218
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:48,703
Things are different; things are things.

219
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,120
Human beings are living things,

220
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:53,078
they are not dead things

221
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,370
that you can change one from another,

222
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:58,703
“I could have got that one or that one.”

223
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,953
You cannot go on like this with human beings

224
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,245
– you’re playing with the Divine then.

225
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:08,745
And this is the main point where we feel that

226
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,329
Sahaja yogis have to learn to accept

227
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:15,287
with joy, with happiness,

228
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,245
and not to project nonsensical ideas.

229
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,995
Then only you will find your joy will be complete.

230
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,911
Otherwise it will not be.

231
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,120
Then if you come, say, to the physical side:

232
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,495
like here it is, if a woman is very thin,

233
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,619
she wants to have legs like this, hands like this,

234
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,828
body like this. Why?

235
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,162
I mean, imagine everybody to be regimented

236
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,995
into certain patterns, so much of the waist,

237
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,370
so much of the thing – horrible it will be.

238
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:48,953
I mean you’ll be tired and fed-up with that.

239
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:50,828
So, you want to be like that.

240
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:54,078
Now the fashion comes in that physically

241
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:58,162
we should be Mr. America or whatever you may call it.

242
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:01,870
So everybody is doing jogging, everybody running like mad.

243
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,995
But why? You have your own personality, keep it up.

244
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,786
You need certain things for your body, the way you are.

245
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:12,037
Of course, if your health is not all right

246
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,703
then you try with your chakras, cure it.

247
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:17,579
But to appearances, to think that

248
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:19,870
“I should look like this, I should be like that,”

249
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:21,828
makes no difference at all.

250
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:25,786
So again, another madness starts, so people are very unhappy.

251
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:29,870
You see, you go to these very so-called elite classes

252
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,120
where most of the men are very highly paid,

253
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,995
educated, top class people,

254
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:38,745
women are also educated, everything,

255
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,619
and what they talk is this only:

256
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,412
how much calories you eat, this is that.

257
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,745
You don’t understand, what’s the matter with these people?

258
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,786
Their level is so low.

259
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,078
That’s a decent talk, and if they come to indecency,

260
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,579
they can go to any level also there.

261
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:58,579
So that shows that there has been no evolution

262
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,078
in that person.

263
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,537
They just think on those terms.

264
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,537
And that’s how they become very serious,

265
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:06,661
very seriously they discuss all this thing.

266
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,537
You feel like laughing at them, the way they are stupid.

267
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,619
So, all these things are regarded

268
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,203
as so important in a country like America

269
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:19,579
or any other country, shows the kind of people they have.

270
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:23,287
I mean, in India nobody is so much bothered about the figure.

271
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:26,828
At least in My age people never liked very thin girls,

272
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:29,454
because they thought they must be very irritable,

273
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:31,953
hot-tempered, all the time thinking.

274
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,786
They never liked very thin girls I really tell you;

275
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,412
even now My husband doesn’t like.

276
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,579
He says, “You see, men have befooled women,

277
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,619
and that’s why women are doing all these things.”

278
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:43,203
You see, he’s a simple man,

279
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,245
so he thinks that the men have befooled them.

280
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:48,620
So, it’s like that, and then they make legs like this

281
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:51,245
or teeth like this or nose like this

282
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,911
and you take a plastic nose, put on – why?

283
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:59,619
So physical also imbalances come in when we start thinking.

284
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,911
Because when we think, we collide with another thinking,

285
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,454
then we form a general thinking,

286
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,828
then a general pattern is accepted.

287
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:11,745
When that is accepted people say, “All right, let’s have it.”

288
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,537
First, they used to have very tight clothes, you see,

289
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,162
and one girl was boasting to Me that she wore

290
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,203
it for eight days and she can’t take it out now.

291
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:20,579
I said, “How, how did you manage?”

292
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,995
She said, “This is something that you can wear

293
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,745
and jump into the tub,

294
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,828
and then it shrinks and you can’t take it out.

295
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:30,245
You can have bath with this,

296
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,245
you can do what you like with this.”

297
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,703
I said, “It’s very filthy.”

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,412
“No, no, you can wash it nicely and wipe it.”

299
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,537
But I said, “Why, why do such a thing

300
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,287
which will completely coagulate your blood inside?”

301
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,953
Now they started suffering,

302
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,661
so now they’re having absolutely loose clothes, you see,

303
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:51,537
lanky-pankies, casual, this thing.

304
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,703
So, they jump from one to another

305
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,828
when you go on thinking about it,

306
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:59,245
trying to devise new methods.

307
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,245
But tradition is different.

308
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,412
Tradition is that when people are traditional,

309
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,287
what happens actually, those people who are sensible

310
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:09,870
can only become traditional,

311
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,870
because they understand whatever is to be discarded,

312
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:14,454
whatever is not to be discarded.

313
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,370
And they try to understand how we are going to ascend.

314
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,537
Not by taking one side,

315
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:21,786
but on both the sides we must weigh

316
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:24,620
and balance ourselves and then go ahead.

317
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,995
And whatever is to be discarded to be discarded,

318
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:30,828
whatever is to be good is to be taken up.

319
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:34,911
Like what you call the trial and error business.

320
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:37,745
You see, you make the error – all right, give it up;

321
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,162
then take another – all right, give it up.

322
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,412
Whatever is good, you keep it and go on with it,

323
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,786
and that’s how you build up a proper tradition

324
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,995
for other people to follow.

325
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:51,329
But those who think of the new things all the time,

326
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,828
they want to have something new all the time,

327
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,078
then they are very much mistaken,

328
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:59,619
that when they do like this what we call is a tomfoolery.

329
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,287
With the new things they can land themselves

330
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:05,454
into terrible messes, and that’s what exactly has happened

331
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,454
to most of the Western countries,

332
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:10,162
that everything new they try.

333
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:13,911
Now the new craze is cocaine – all right, have cocaine.

334
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:16,287
I mean, even I would not be surprised

335
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,329
if Prince Philip takes to such a thing

336
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,203
or somebody takes to thing like that.

337
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,287
I mean, everybody wants to try new,

338
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:27,203
and if you say you cannot try then they say, “Why, why not?”

339
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,995
This is a very big problem with the Western mind.

340
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,245
So, you all people should also understand,

341
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,037
don’t try new things in Sahaja Yoga.

342
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,454
Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing.

343
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,370
Don’t try anything new in Sahaja Yoga.

344
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:50,412
Whatever we have is more than sufficient,

345
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:51,911
you don’t try anything new.

346
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,037
People who tried new things have jumped into problems,

347
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,786
so do not try something new.

348
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:02,911
Like somebody said that nowadays, you see,

349
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,828
I heard in London we had some people

350
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,037
who started giving lectures

351
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,579
and giving new methods of Sahaja Yoga, suddenly.

352
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,037
And they all went mad.

353
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,619
I mean, their vibrations were crazy,

354
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:18,495
I didn’t know what to do with them.

355
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,870
I was quite surprised.

356
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:22,495
I said, “Why did you try a new method like that?

357
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,078
What was the need to try a new method?”

358
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:28,661
“Oh,” they said, “Well we thought, better try this one.”

359
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:30,870
But I said, “I have already told you all the methods.

360
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:32,745
Have you tried, have you perfected yourself?

361
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,203
Better try those which I’ve told you,

362
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:39,329
and then you can ask Me and then start something new.

363
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:41,703
But you must understand what you are doing.”

364
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,078
And also, I’ve seen mediocre Sahaja yogis always do like that,

365
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:49,037
try some new method. And they’ll come out with this thing,

366
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:52,245
“Now I’ll tell you how to circulate your breath.”

367
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,162
Why to circulate your breath?

368
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,953
Suddenly they find out a new method.

369
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,203
Is a common thing, but these are sometimes could be

370
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:03,037
very sinister people also, so be careful.

371
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,620
There is no need to try new methods.

372
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:08,454
Now you have jumped on to that awareness

373
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:10,579
where you have to just be steady.

374
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,329
So, don’t try at this point something new.

375
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:17,370
Just steady yourself, steady yourself in balance

376
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,412
– that’s very important.

377
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,454
Second point is that everyone

378
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:26,287
should be knowledgeable in Sahaja Yoga.

379
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,329
But some people are so funnily knowledgeable

380
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,911
that I’m sometimes surprised.

381
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:35,537
Like there was a fellow who was homosexual

382
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,203
or nonsensical thing,

383
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,329
and then he told some people that

384
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:42,620
“Yes, you see, Mother says it’s all right once in a while.”

385
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:46,245
I never said so. I can never say such a thing.

386
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,370
Then somebody said, “Drinking – all right, Mother said.”

387
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:52,412
How could I say? There’s no compromise.

388
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:56,620
Somebody says, “It’s all right, you can do some business.”

389
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,370
I never said so.

390
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,786
No, you cannot do, these things are not,

391
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:02,245
they are not meant for you.

392
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:05,078
You don’t have to do it at all. Right?

393
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,953
So, anybody who comes out with such ideas,

394
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,786
you tell them “nothing of the kind.”

395
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,329
There’s nothing like that,

396
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:14,412
there’s no compromise in Sahaja Yoga, no compromise.

397
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:16,412
Whatever methods we have learned,

398
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:19,245
let us practice them to establish ourselves

399
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,454
and establish others.

400
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:23,579
You must keep to your maryadas, to your limits.

401
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:26,162
Do not try to fly.

402
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,120
Some people think that they are greater Sahaja yogis

403
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:31,412
and they will do this and they will do that.

404
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:33,495
Then remember, that is wrong.

405
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,786
You have to humble down yourself,

406
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,745
and remember that when you humble down

407
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,828
you will realize that only the humble people

408
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,162
are steady people.

409
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,162
So, there should be complete humility.

410
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,828
Try to acquire more knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

411
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:54,620
There are so many ways.

412
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,287
I have got all My tapes done already,

413
00:22:57,661 --> 00:23:01,412
we have got all these Sahaja Yoga books out now

414
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:03,870
and also your “Nirmala Yoga” is there

415
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:07,412
– so many ways by which you can understand Sahaja Yoga.

416
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:10,037
If you don’t understand, you can ask each other,

417
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:13,661
try to analyse it the way you want to understand,

418
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:17,120
that what Mother is saying, is this is what She’s saying.

419
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:20,495
Because My lectures are in very, very simple language.

420
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,370
I use extremely simple language,

421
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:27,661
avoiding all literary language as far as possible of course;

422
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:31,162
sometimes I do have to use difficult words, but normally.

423
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,828
So, but beyond that is a very subtle knowledge flowing.

424
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:38,995
So, to understand that sometimes may be difficult,

425
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:43,037
you may try to sort of construct something else out of it,

426
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:45,619
may try to sort of interpret something.

427
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,245
If there’s any such problem,

428
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,786
better consult somebody whom you think

429
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:52,078
is capable of advising you.

430
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:54,329
But you must accept that.

431
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,870
You should not put forward your viewpoint,

432
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:58,870
and it would be very wrong.

433
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:02,995
Then you will be sort of like a derailed train

434
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,370
which goes out of track.

435
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,579
We have a track in Sahaja Yoga,

436
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,661
you must know that, whether you like it or not.

437
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,495
It’s no question of freedom, but the track to ascend.

438
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,537
You cannot get out of that track.

439
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,745
If you think you can just move about a little bit,

440
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:22,245
have a nice time with all filth

441
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,495
and then come back to Sahaja Yoga, you won’t be acceptable.

442
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,495
If you do that then I’ll have to work hard

443
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,078
to cleanse you out, do this, do that.

444
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,454
But to keep yourself clean you’d better keep to your tracks

445
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:36,120
and don’t get out of it.

446
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:41,745
Don’t try to find out new things of doing something

447
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:44,203
which is not necessary; why do it?

448
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,162
I mean, simple thing is to understand it’s a waste of energy.

449
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,203
I’ve already found it for you,

450
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:53,329
why do you want to do it again?

451
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,120
Like this kind of a blouse

452
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,329
I’ve been wearing now for the last, I think,

453
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,995
fifty years or maybe more, this type of a blouse.

454
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:05,495
Now My tailor knows that I wear this blouse, this is this,

455
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:07,745
this is this. He has got My measurements.

456
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,870
So, I have to just tell him that

457
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,661
“You get Me a cloth of this kind,

458
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:15,120
and just make a blouse for Me.” He makes it.

459
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,120
For the last so many years I have had,

460
00:25:17,537 --> 00:25:20,537
about twenty-five years, I had one tailor who does My job.

461
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,870
He has no headache, I have no headache, no problem.

462
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,786
Every day if I have to change this pattern,

463
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,703
make a new sleeve and a new type of a blouse,

464
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:31,870
I’ll have a headache, I mean, I tell you.

465
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,287
So why, why do that? What’s the use?

466
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:37,786
Who sees, who is affected by that?

467
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:43,120
So unnecessarily we are wasting our energy on these things.

468
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:45,703
But I don’t say that you should be regimented,

469
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:49,703
by any means, but what I mean that wherever

470
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:52,203
you can save your energy of thinking, you should do it.

471
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:55,287
For small, small things there’s no need to have varieties,

472
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:58,120
and this country as I’ve told you before

473
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,203
hat every tap has to be different,

474
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,037
every handle is to be different,

475
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,703
every tile has to be different – what is the need?

476
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,786
What has to be different is artistic things.

477
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:12,245
Sari has to be different because it is artistic.

478
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:14,412
But what is in a stitching of a blouse,

479
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:15,870
there’s no art in it involved.

480
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,745
So, whatever is artistic can be different,

481
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,037
but whatever is mundane need not be.

482
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:23,495
In the machinery why should you have

483
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,078
different types of things, you’ll go mad.

484
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,786
You go to a shop, there’s twenty types of things,

485
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:30,953
you don’t which one to buy, all made by machine only.

486
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,661
This is good, that is good.

487
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:35,245
Then another fellow he comes, he says, “Not good.”

488
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,120
Then you feel hurt.

489
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:41,162
But if you have for mundane things, few things is better,

490
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,245
that you do not take too many headaches upon yourself.

491
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,162
So best thing to avoid all these problems

492
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,870
is to use your new awareness of vibrations.

493
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,828
So, you save your energies.

494
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,995
Your energies must be saved,

495
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:58,911
and they can be saved if you do not pay attention to things

496
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:03,203
which are not your style, where you don’t have to go.

497
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,162
Just see vibrations. If I go for shopping

498
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,828
– now I go shopping for various reasons, as you know.

499
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,579
One is to put My vibrations there;

500
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:15,745
another is to put also vibrations on the people

501
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,370
who are in the market.

502
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,537
Thirdly is to look at all the things,

503
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,619
so My vibrations go onto them.

504
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:24,828
Fourthly, to buy something to be given to others.

505
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:28,661
But if I like something it is only through vibrations

506
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:31,953
and I buy it somehow,

507
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,329
because it is to be given to someone

508
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,703
or something has to be done later.

509
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,745
I just buy it, keep it, it comes very handy.

510
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,619
That is how your attitude should be.

511
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:48,287
But on the contrary if you just go on,

512
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:51,287
“I like this, I don’t like it,” about your wife,

513
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,245
about your jobs, your everything, you’ll be uncertain.

514
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,620
These days in America

515
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:59,537
people are very funny about their jobs also.

516
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,120
I have to touch these points,

517
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:02,619
because you’ll face this problem.

518
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,828
Today they’re doing some job, “I don’t like it,

519
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:06,870
I don’t like my boss” – another job.

520
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,078
Then they’ll go to another job, they change it.

521
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:10,870
Then third job, change it.

522
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,245
They like to change, you know, all the time

523
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,454
– it’s maddening, I tell you.

524
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,620
Change their wives, change their house,

525
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,579
change everything. Why?

526
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:24,870
Have only one wife, is better.

527
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,454
At the most have two jobs in life, is better.

528
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:33,245
And at the most change three residences, is better.

529
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,454
But more than that is a headache.

530
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:37,745
I mean, to Me, I have changed forty houses

531
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:41,537
because of My husband’s temperament.

532
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:47,911
But I’m different, because I’m absolutely a person

533
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,870
who is not bothered whatever change comes.

534
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,620
But you are not the same, so don’t waste your energy.

535
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:56,037
So, this is very important to understand,

536
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:00,287
not to go on changing jobs, is very important.

537
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:03,078
Because that is also a craze, I tell you.

538
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,579
I’ll tell you about Douglas. He used to do that.

539
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,620
Every time he had financial problem

540
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:12,037
because he was changing jobs. So, one day I told him off.

541
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:14,703
I said, “Douglas, if you change this job”

542
00:29:15,037 --> 00:29:16,579
– because I saw the vibrations are all right

543
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,203
– “if you change this job,

544
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,162
that you are not going to see Me again.”

545
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,120
And now today he has got a house, he’s got a car,

546
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:28,329
he’s got money in the bank, he’s doing well.

547
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,245
So that also is a headache for Me,

548
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,828
“Mother, I have no job, I have no money. What am I to do?”

549
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,995
Every time there are people who come to India, they say,

550
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:45,703
“Mother, I have no money, I’m sorry I couldn’t pay You.”

551
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,828
All right, doesn’t matter.

552
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,203
There are at least, this last time also there were five people.

553
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,995
But before that I think there were about twenty people.

554
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,329
So, every time it happens like this.

555
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:59,703
So now we must understand, we must have proper jobs.

556
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,661
We have to be respectable people.

557
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,828
We must have proper qualifications,

558
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:06,495
if possible, better to get some qualifications.

559
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,745
You are all very intelligent people

560
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:11,245
and you can get your qualifications.

561
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:14,287
You should have a respectability in the society.

562
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:16,661
Otherwise they’ll think that this Mother

563
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:20,162
is the Mother of all the beggars.

564
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,745
So steady yourself in your jobs, in your houses.

565
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:30,620
To steady yourself you must learn not to change.

566
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:40,370
The change makes you unsteady – do you see the point?

567
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,245
So, there is no question of changing.

568
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:44,703
“I’m going to go through it.”

569
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:49,120
Then if it is necessary, if it is not workable,

570
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,537
then one can change.

571
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:54,120
It applies to everything.

572
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:58,828
Now, guru-shopping is nothing but change.

573
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:02,703
The more gurus you have, the greater headache I have.

574
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,537
If you have only one guru, say horrible one,

575
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:07,495
it’s all right, easy to clear you out.

576
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:10,454
But if you have been to twenty, whatever am I to do?

577
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,287
One fellow who has been to gurus so much

578
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,454
that I couldn’t understand his personality.

579
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:17,454
I said, “What’s the matter with this?”

580
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:20,454
Every problem, you name it and it’s there.

581
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,329
I said, “What sort of a fellow is this?”

582
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:23,745
So, I said, “All right, write it down

583
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:25,412
all the names of all the gurus you have been to.”

584
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:29,953
He wrote three foolscap papers on both the sides.

585
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:32,745
I said, “I’m sorry, sir, I can’t help you.”

586
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,495
He said, “Mother, You have to,

587
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,579
because there’s a very immediate problem.”

588
00:31:36,953 --> 00:31:38,745
I said, “What is the immediate problem?”

589
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:41,370
“That now I am becoming a woman.”

590
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:44,620
I said, “Hah?”

591
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:48,537
“The doctors have said that now I’m becoming a woman.”

592
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:51,579
I said, “That’s really an immediate problem.”

593
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:55,703
I said, “That much I can stop, but you need lot of cleansing.”

594
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,329
And he used to sometimes look like Hanumana,

595
00:31:58,703 --> 00:32:00,203
sometimes he looks like a madman,

596
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,745
he used to look like anything,

597
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,537
because so many gurus in him were working it out.

598
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:08,620
Ultimately that he got himself cleansed out

599
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,870
and his problem was solved,

600
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,412
but even now I would not say that he is a Sahaja yogi;

601
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:16,329
though he’s very learned, knows all about Sanskrit

602
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:17,703
because he has been to so many gurus,

603
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:21,287
every type of guru he has been.

604
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,620
This has come by change – “what’s wrong?”

605
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:30,495
So, once you come to Sahaja Yoga, then stop.

606
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:34,037
Stop everything else.

607
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,620
Second point that I stressed was this,

608
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:40,661
that in Sahaja Yoga once you come,

609
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:43,995
focus yourself to Me and Sahaja Yoga first,

610
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,412
and then other things.

611
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:47,287
Like Christians when they come to Sahaja Yoga,

612
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:49,745
they can’t accept Ganesh.

613
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:54,203
Indians who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot accept Christ.

614
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,454
Muslims who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot take to puja.

615
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:01,495
Everybody is coming with a load behind them.

616
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:05,037
So better come and put them at My feet, finished.

617
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:08,245
Now you see them through My prism,

618
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:12,786
through Me – is better to understand that way.

619
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:15,620
And those who have understood Me that way,

620
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:19,037
just understand Sahaja Yoga in a perfect manner.

621
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:22,078
There’s no fanaticism of the past,

622
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:24,245
neither of Sahaja Yoga either.

623
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:27,911
So, they understand that this is all the same as Mother is,

624
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:30,786
and there’s nothing to be sticking

625
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:32,828
onto one thing or to another.

626
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:36,329
But it doesn’t mean that if you call Me

627
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:39,287
the Goddess Kali you are insulting Me,

628
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:42,995
or if you call Me Mataji Nirmala Devi you’re elevating Me

629
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,495
– it’s all there.

630
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:48,995
So one has to understand that all this

631
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:52,786
is related to our own compartments.

632
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:56,412
God has no compartments like that.

633
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,828
It is not that America exists in His mind,

634
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,619
or it is not that anything exists in mind.

635
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:06,370
Do we exist like “now I am only my Vishuddhi”

636
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:07,953
– do we exist like that?

637
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,495
Or “I’m only my nose” – do we?

638
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,537
We exist as the whole body.

639
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:17,162
So, God exists – though He has a nose, He has His ears, say,

640
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,995
everything is there; but He exists as God.

641
00:34:20,454 --> 00:34:22,661
He doesn’t exist like a nose, separate,

642
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,037
doesn’t exist like only America separate,

643
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:27,995
but He’s existing as the whole,

644
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:33,703
everything related to the whole.

645
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,037
And when such a thing happens to us

646
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,661
that now we are related to the whole, the Primordial Being,

647
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,911
we should not relate ourselves

648
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:44,537
to something that will localize us

649
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:47,329
because of our conditionings.

650
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,412
No localization should be there,

651
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:51,537
we should be in circulation.

652
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:55,162
I find it difficult for people who have been Catholics

653
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,620
to worship Shri Ganesh with the same respect,

654
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,203
because they are conditioned.

655
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,370
So, try to leave it for a while, Christ,

656
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:05,037
completely leave Him alone.

657
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:08,953
Come to Sahaja Yoga, then you’ll see Him in proper light.

658
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:11,245
Because this is the problem is,

659
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:16,995
that unless and until you come inside and see for yourself

660
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,661
that all roads have come to this one thing,

661
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,495
so they are just the same, there’s no difference at all.

662
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,329
First come inside.

663
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,412
Give up everything, come inside.

664
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:29,078
Then you will know that it’s all the same.

665
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,287
And this is very important,

666
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,953
and once you see that,

667
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:37,661
it’s such a beautiful thing that you have no complications

668
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:41,870
of any kind, belonging to any particular cult

669
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,745
or particular guru or a particular thing.

670
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:49,037
Even so-called religions are like cults if you see to it,

671
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,245
they are like cults, they have conditionings.

672
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,703
They have not given you anything but conditioning

673
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:55,203
and illusions.

674
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,786
So, we are not to live with illusions,

675
00:35:57,162 --> 00:35:58,245
we have to live with reality.

676
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,412
And the reality is that, that all these essences are one,

677
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,953
and we have to be inside them

678
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:09,120
so that we can see them, all of them as one.

679
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,454
This is also very important thing in country like America,

680
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:16,911
I feel, because there are such diverse ideas,

681
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:20,703
such diverse ideas that I, I’m surprised at them.

682
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,162
Everything you name it is in America.

683
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,245
The other day I developed one thing called Mormon,

684
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:29,870
Mormon or something. Mormon.

685
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:32,120
Name it and it’s in America.

686
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:36,370
I don’t know how all the varieties have gathered here.

687
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:39,828
Every sort of a guru, I mean, you discover them here.

688
00:36:40,162 --> 00:36:41,454
I had never heard of so many names.

689
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,329
Whenever I come, I’d find a new guru coming up.

690
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:48,203
Why America is the place where all these prosper like this,

691
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:49,745
like mushrooms, you see?

692
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:52,953
A mushroom is growing, that is – is it a rottening thing?

693
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,287
Only mushroom grows as fungus.

694
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:01,412
Is it rottening, this country? What’s happening? Why?

695
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,245
It is the mind of human beings.

696
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:08,412
The mind of human beings here always wants a new thing,

697
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:11,203
and that’s why a supply comes.

698
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,745
As a result of that they become unsteady.

699
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:17,537
So, the main problem of American character

700
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:20,454
is that they are very unsteady people.

701
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:24,870
You ask them, “How are you?” They also say ….

702
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:26,703
Understand whatever you like.

703
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,162
They’ll never say “How are you?” ….

704
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:32,579
What do you understand with that?

705
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,037
I mean, an Indian person can’t understand.

706
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:37,537
If somebody says like that, an Indian, you see,

707
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,703
if you ask him, “How are you?”

708
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,412
and he says like this, they’ll say, “Are you mad?”

709
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:48,537
Then if you ask them, “Do you understand this?”

710
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,120
“I’m confused.”

711
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,078
An Indian will never say such a thing,

712
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,412
“I’m confused.” He’s cocksure.

713
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,995
“I’m confused” means, are you a lunatic or what?

714
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:02,454
Why are you confused? Something wrong with your brain?

715
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:06,078
So, all these ideas, you see,

716
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,203
are tending towards our unsteadiness,

717
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,911
frivolousness, superficiality.

718
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:15,287
You are really bombarded by superficiality,

719
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,412
bombarded, I can see that.

720
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,786
Absolutely from everywhere, you see, the media, this, that:

721
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,786
it’s nothing but superficial.

722
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:26,828
It really kills the inner germ in the human being.

723
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:28,454
And you want to live with it,

724
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,162
then you want to think on those lines,

725
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:35,454
and really you lose yourself, all contact with yourself is lost.

726
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:38,203
Under all these circumstances one has to know

727
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,162
one beautiful fact,

728
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,037
that so many seekers are born in this country.

729
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:48,454
It’s America which I visited the first.

730
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,745
And I’m sure San Diego is the place where it will start,

731
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:55,703
I have a feeling.

732
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,911
[Marathi]

733
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:04,412
So this is a place very important, and I’m nice,

734
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:07,703
I’m happy that you have arranged this wonderful puja,

735
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,619
and we should do this puja.

736
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:15,078
And I am sure by this we will have a time,

737
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:19,245
especially good time coming

738
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:25,370
where we’ll have on one side American evolution,

739
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:28,203
on the other side, Mexican.

740
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:31,579
This we can work out from San Diego.

741
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:35,495
It’s a beautiful day that you have asked for this puja.

742
00:39:35,953 --> 00:39:37,454
I’m very happy about it.

743
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,703
Today is the day of the Goddess,

744
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,828
[Marathi] – Thrayodashi.

745
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,745
Thrayodashi is the best, thirteenth day.

746
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:57,162
[Marathi]

747
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:13,120
See the vibrations, you don’t need any puja!

748
00:40:19,703 --> 00:40:22,370
There’s no need to have a puja, really, it is so much today.

749
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:23,995
So today is a great day,

750
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,579
and I’m happy he’s asked for this puja here.

751
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,703
So, now to begin with ….

752
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:35,370
Now if you have any problems, any questions,

753
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:37,911
you must let Me know.

754
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:40,370
One thing, a Sahaja yogi should not be

755
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:43,911
a serious person, that’s one thing.

756
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:48,203
That doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi to be serious.

757
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:51,120
You should be smiling, laughing, enjoying.

758
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,078
If he’s a serious person then he’s not a Sahaja yogi.

759
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,745
I can’t keep serious for more than five minutes,

760
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:58,412
at the most five minutes.

761
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,620
Even if I have to scold somebody, I prepare Myself,

762
00:41:02,078 --> 00:41:04,454
then I come down and I shout,

763
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:07,495
and then after five minutes if I don’t run away

764
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,786
then you’ll find Me again laughing.

765
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:12,579
Can’t – it’s all a joke!

766
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:21,037
So, nobody should be serious, that’s one thing.

767
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:22,619
Nobody should be serious.

768
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:24,911
You should be always smiling and happy people,

769
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,828
because there is joy within you. What is there?

770
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:33,078
Only by thinking “I’m miserable, I’m miserable,” you see

771
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,579
– that’s French style!

772
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,329
French, you know, when I went there first time, they told Me,

773
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:45,412
“Mother, You look too happy” – for French.

774
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:47,037
So, I said, “What should I do?”

775
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,037
Said, “Do You see, they are all very,

776
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:51,703
they think they are very Misérables people, this, that.”

777
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:53,953
So, I said, “All right.” So I went and said,

778
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:56,120
“Now see, you are all les Misérables”

779
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,370
– you know Victor Hugo has written this “Les Misérables”

780
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:01,745
– so I said, “All right, you les miserables.

781
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,454
Now I am a person who is not miserable at all.

782
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:07,619
And you will be miserable in any case if you have,

783
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:12,454
every third house you have a pub,

784
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,162
every tenth house you have a prostitute,

785
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:19,037
so what will happen? I mean, you are in for it.”

786
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,745
That’s what it is.

787
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:23,703
And even Yogi Mahajan told Me that

788
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:27,203
“Mother, we want Your photograph which is very serious,

789
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:28,870
it is hard to get one,

790
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,620
and we must put a face which is very serious.”

791
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,620
And ultimately, he ended up with a photograph

792
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,537
which was horrid.

793
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:40,661
When he told Me, “It’s a very nice photograph,

794
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:44,329
You look so serene,” this, that and all the descriptions.

795
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,495
When I saw the photograph I said, “It’s horrid!”

796
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:49,661
He said, “Really?”

797
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:52,620
I said, “All right, let Me tell you who has done this.”

798
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,370
He said, “Who?” I told him the name and he was shocked.

799
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:59,245
I said, “That’s the lady who has given you,

800
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,412
and you know where she is today.”

801
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:05,786
Was shocked how I told the name “Jane.”

802
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:12,037
I said, “This is the photograph you are sending to Americans.”

803
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:15,287
But I know Americans will be attracted by that photograph,

804
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,579
because they are miserable themselves, you see.

805
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:21,329
But such people who are attracted

806
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:24,412
to that kind of a photograph will drop out in no time,

807
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,329
they will not stick on – you don’t understand that point.

808
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:30,370
They are not the type who’ll stick on.

809
00:43:30,661 --> 00:43:32,162
Like in Scotland, I went there

810
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,620
and there was a photograph I saw, and I got a shock.

811
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:38,828
We had gone to a restaurant where we were to have our food,

812
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,537
and I saw My photograph and I said, “Who has done this one?”

813
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,287
They said, “This is the copy of one of the Australian ones.”

814
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:47,287
I said, “But who has done it?

815
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:50,579
Because this is not good – very bad.”

816
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,412
So, they said, “This is done by someone, suddenly.”

817
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:57,953
I said, “I’ll name the person,”

818
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,620
and I told them who has done it: Hilary.

819
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:04,661
They were all amazed at it.

820
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:07,495
I said, “This photograph is no good.”

821
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,162
But now they had put it everywhere. I said, “Let it be.”

822
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,370
So many people came to My program, all funny types, you know.

823
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,911
Some had one eye, some had one nose,

824
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:21,287
some had something else wrong, everything missing.

825
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:25,037
“Oh God,” I said, “this is the thing of the photograph.”

826
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,828
And not one person came back.

827
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:30,953
We had at least about five,

828
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:34,162
six hundred people for the program, all like this, you see.

829
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:37,370
[Marathi]

830
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,329
And none of them came back, not one person.

831
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:47,078
All bhoots, attracted by the bhoot; and I could see

832
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:50,995
on My photograph that it was just repelling it.

833
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,953
So those who take My photograph also

834
00:44:57,537 --> 00:45:02,120
reflect in the photograph.

835
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:06,287
You must have seen Ray’s photograph come out very well.

836
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,287
I don’t which one is Ray’s here,

837
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:10,870
but Ray’s photographs used to be very good.

838
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,953
And this time Ray, he has a funny wife, I think.

839
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:16,370
He went to India, and Indians told Me,

840
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:18,995
“Mother, I don’t know how this Ray is so ruined.”

841
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:20,162
In India it doesn’t happen.

842
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,619
Once a Sahaja yogi, then they improve.

843
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:26,370
But this fellow was just the opposite – now what to do?

844
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,828
They said, “Mother, he’s all gone down, what to do?”

845
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,412
I said, “Must have been something wrong. What to do?”

846
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,620
When I came back, you see,

847
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,703
Ray brought three or four photographs of Mine.

848
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,786
When he showed, everybody was shocked.

849
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,120
“These are not Mother’s photographs.”

850
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:46,661
And he had to withdraw them. This is what it is.

851
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,579
Same Ray who made such beautiful photographs

852
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:52,661
was having horrible photographs nowadays.

853
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,203
So, in everything what you do, everything that you achieve,

854
00:45:57,661 --> 00:45:59,120
you can make it out.

855
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:04,786
You suddenly become an extremely posh person, you can say,

856
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:07,828
with a finesse, once you are a good Sahaja yogi.

857
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:11,329
Everything comes in proper stream.

858
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:14,579
You can make it out, very simple ways

859
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:20,619
of such a person are so pleasing and so soothing.

860
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,579
So, on these points I have covered lots of things

861
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:30,995
which I wanted to say, and that end with it

862
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,537
I would say that as Vishuddhis you have to become the sakshi,

863
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,203
the witness. You have to become the witness.

864
00:46:38,703 --> 00:46:41,579
And to become the witness there has to be a detachment.

865
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:44,911
That doesn’t mean you live on a shoestring by any chance,

866
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,370
but try to have a detachment.

867
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:52,620
Thank God this time the experience of the Sahaja yogis

868
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,661
from America was not so bad.

869
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,329
They were very good people,

870
00:46:56,703 --> 00:46:59,619
they adjusted themselves well and they enjoyed themselves.

871
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:01,287
It was fine.

872
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,287
And I hope more and more will come and will enjoy themselves.

873
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,495
And as you know the new programming has taken place.

874
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,995
Is better you people tell us if you are coming or not.

875
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:16,412
But also, don’t change last minute,

876
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:21,495
it creates problems for us, for everyone.

877
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:25,162
So please don’t change; if you’re not coming, it’s all right.

878
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,245
You will have a certain date, by that time you decide,

879
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,245
don’t change. You see it’s only Americans who did this,

880
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:34,120
nobody else.

881
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:35,620
And we told people,

882
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:38,454
“Now no more, let’s give more chance to Americans are coming,

883
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:41,203
we should give them more chance; so no, you are not coming.”

884
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:44,619
So poor things, they came for ten days, five days,

885
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,619
because we could not arrange for them.

886
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,412
So, you should not change your ideas.

887
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:55,329
If you are coming you can decide up to a point,

888
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:57,620
if you are coming or not coming.

889
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:01,703
If you are not coming you just say, “Yes, we are not coming,”

890
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:04,995
or if you are coming you just say,

891
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,537
“Yes we are coming,” and you do it.

892
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:11,454
At least that much you should not change.

893
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:16,454
So again, I request you to keep to your schedules and things,

894
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,162
because it really upsets the whole thing.

895
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,911
Because now we are working on the rhythm of the Divine,

896
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,953
and we have no business to upset the rhythm.

897
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:31,661
You may be Americans, but as you know in Sahaja Yoga

898
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,619
Americans are not placed very high up.

899
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,661
You know that very well.

900
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:40,078
And we think Italians are much better off;

901
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:45,579
they take to Sahaja Yoga just like a fish takes to water.

902
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:50,162
So, Americans have to work a little harder,

903
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,703
they have to do a little more to get to that adjustments.

904
00:48:57,745 --> 00:49:01,870
What to do? Such a great a country, so many seekers,

905
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,870
but they are already ruined – what am I to do?

906
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,412
Trying My level best.

907
00:49:06,786 --> 00:49:09,162
You all should help and understand the difficulties,

908
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,828
and you have to be kind to the newcomers and see

909
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:15,329
that you put them right.

910
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:22,412
So, we have to think of our ascent from San Diego,

911
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,245
and from this corner we are going to enlighten

912
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:29,828
the whole of America.

913
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:33,329
For practical purposes I’ve decided

914
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:37,078
that Dr. Worlikar should be in charge

915
00:49:37,537 --> 00:49:43,245
in the eastern side

916
00:49:43,786 --> 00:49:46,495
[Marathi]

917
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,995
– western side.

918
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:53,078
For us, New York is already western, all right;

919
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,995
and the eastern side is, the New York side

920
00:49:57,454 --> 00:50:00,495
can be managed by him.

921
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,661
Because there’s a, like a two countries it is, two countries,

922
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:05,370
two different types of thing.

923
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,619
So that is how it is to be managed.

924
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:12,579
Money matters: you should do deal with money matters

925
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:14,037
with his consent.

926
00:50:14,495 --> 00:50:18,037
So, I told him how I do it is that the money

927
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:21,745
is kept in the bank under the name of the

928
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:24,412
registered name or whichever way it is,

929
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:30,619
and they have the check book, but I have to sign.

930
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:33,661
So, you keep the check book but he has to sign,

931
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:36,287
so he sees what you are spending.

932
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:38,037
So, check is there.

933
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,370
Or you do the same there, see,

934
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:43,203
so that she keeps the check book but you sign,

935
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,745
so you know how much is being spent.

936
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:47,245
So, there’s a check.

937
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:50,037
Of course, as far as you people are concerned,

938
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,495
I know it’s all right, but still ….

939
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:57,120
Why I do so many things, just to make you understand.

940
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:02,245
Like if you give Me puja money, I keep a packet of that.

941
00:51:02,745 --> 00:51:04,078
I keep an account of that.

942
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:06,120
There’s no need: who’s going to ask Me

943
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:07,953
what did I do with the puja money?

944
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,370
But I do, I do keep it.

945
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:15,120
And then what do I do with the puja money is that

946
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,745
I want to use it for your puja materials, puja things,

947
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,078
for presents and things.

948
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,495
So, I keep. I need not do it, that’s My money,

949
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,786
at least that much is Mine,

950
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,619
but My pleasure is such.

951
00:51:28,995 --> 00:51:31,412
So that is how one must know that

952
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:37,120
if Mother is so strict with it, why not we?

953
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:40,703
You have to give money in puja, no doubt,

954
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:42,329
because that has to be.

955
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:44,245
First, we used to take one “p”.

956
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:48,745
Then I went to two “p”, then to five “p’s”, ten “p’s”

957
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:51,786
– it has increased like that.

958
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:53,579
And for these pujas then,

959
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,703
for the main pujas that we are going to have,

960
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,495
one on New York, they have decided certain amount.

961
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,661
That is your decision, I never said anything,

962
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,661
because I was only up to one pound, I was there.

963
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,579
Then I don’t know, I got lost with these people.

964
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:10,620
So whatever they decide, that is there,

965
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,579
is the money that is collected under the name of puja,

966
00:52:15,037 --> 00:52:18,995
which I have to take for the Nabhi Chakra.

967
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:23,620
You have to do it with heart, just like the Shabari style,

968
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,911
and everything will fall in proper places.

969
00:52:30,078 --> 00:52:34,786
So one can say that

970
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:38,412
Sahaja Yoga is not an extreme thing.

971
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,620
We do give money;

972
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:43,620
only the Sahaja yogis can donate money.

973
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,703
Say, for food here you have to pay,

974
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:48,537
for the house you have to pay.

975
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:51,870
You do pay, you don’t live here like parasites.

976
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,454
We don’t want parasites around us.

977
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,995
But it doesn’t also mean that you rob

978
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,495
a Sahaja yogi completely and make him a pauper,

979
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,870
and build your own Rolls Royces!

980
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:13,037
So it is not also the other way, that you people rob Me.

981
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:21,287
So one has to understand that Sahaja Yoga is give and take,

982
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:24,037
in a proper certain manners,

983
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:28,703
and that has to be properly done with grace,

984
00:53:29,203 --> 00:53:33,495
with understanding, with a beautiful feeling

985
00:53:33,953 --> 00:53:37,619
that we are all part and parcel of the whole.

986
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:44,537
And for which America is responsible,

987
00:53:44,995 --> 00:53:48,786
because America has to become the Virat.

988
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:56,037
The Vishuddhi has to become the Virat.

989
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,537
What a responsibility!

990
00:54:01,078 --> 00:54:03,078
So don’t quarrel among yourselves,

991
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:06,786
don’t quarrel among husband and wife.

992
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:14,245
Try to be one in complete unison, enjoy each other.

993
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,786
That’s very important. All right.

994
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,203
So may God bless you.

995
00:54:19,537 --> 00:54:22,412
[Marathi: This is Virata’s place]

996
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:29,495
Even now the Right Vishuddhi is catching. All right.

997
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:34,329
[Marathi – directions for puja]

998
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:51,370
Now, I want those people who have not washed My feet so far,

999
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:54,537
should come forward.

1000
00:56:57,828 --> 00:57:00,037
One by one.

1001
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:08,412
Let them handle the situation.

1002
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,162
… can do it.

1003
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:12,245
Danny, you also come here.

1004
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:17,037
Now, two persons at a time will do it.

1005
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,370
It’s very cold water.

1006
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:48,078
Very good, very good. Very, very good.

1007
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:56,120
Rub it. Rub My feet.

1008
00:59:05,245 --> 00:59:08,329
Now just see your vibrations.

1009
00:59:12,037 --> 00:59:14,078
All right?

1010
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,911
Good?

1011
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:18,287
May God bless you. Now come along.

1012
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:20,620
Should be warm.

1013
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,995
Come along, both of you.

1014
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:46,454
May God bless you.

1015
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,370
Rub it.

1016
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:55,287
Put it on this one.

1017
00:59:56,454 --> 00:59:59,037
Rub it.

1018
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:15,703
Done! Now, come along – see your vibrations.

1019
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:26,454
Now, keep smiling like that, it’s all right,

1020
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:30,245
it’s all right – the sari can be dried.

1021
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,745
May God bless you.

1022
01:01:35,454 --> 01:01:37,745
On the eyes and the head, wipe it.

1023
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:40,786
Come along.

1024
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:46,495
Very good.

1025
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,703
May God bless you.

1026
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:14,037
Hold it with one hand, tight, and another hand, rub it hard.

1027
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:43,953
Ah, good. You can feel the vibrations well.

1028
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:49,995
Your right, left hand, rub it – the last finger, pull it out.

1029
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:54,037
Last finger, pull it out.

1030
01:03:55,953 --> 01:03:58,495
It’s got it.

1031
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:02,037
Now, see your vibrations.

1032
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:11,078
May God bless you.

1033
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:14,370
On the eyes and the head.

1034
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:17,870
Come along. Your face has changed with this!

1035
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:22,454
All right? Good. May God bless.

1036
01:04:27,953 --> 01:04:30,995
Perfect.

1037
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:01,786
That’s all. Come along. That’s better.

1038
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:05,828
Right, now hold it tight.

1039
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:09,828
Rub your full hand.

1040
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:14,412
You see, the hand, your hand is to be rubbed, not My feet.

1041
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,828
Pull that out. Pull it tight.

1042
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,245
Ah!

1043
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,162
Mm, good.

1044
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:00,870
I think we are all right.

1045
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:04,287
Now just sit, this side.

1046
01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:13,537
All right?

1047
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,245
You can’t keep it.

1048
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,412
Put it on your head.

1049
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:25,245
On your head, and then wipe your eyes also.

1050
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:34,037
May God bless you.

1051
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:46,828
I think you come with him, that’s all right.

1052
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:51,329
It’s all right. A little water.

1053
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,661
Now, they can use the same water to do My feet. Come along.

1054
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,245
May God bless you.

1055
01:08:07,078 --> 01:08:08,953
Now...

1056
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:19,786
Hold it. Rub it hard.

1057
01:08:26,162 --> 01:08:29,245
Rub it hard.

1058
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:17,203
Now see.

1059
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,619
Now.

1060
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,745
All right?

1061
01:09:36,454 --> 01:09:40,370
See the left is – a little bit.

1062
01:10:17,162 --> 01:10:18,329
All right.

1063
01:10:18,537 --> 01:10:20,245
While sitting, just put the left hand towards Me,

1064
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:22,786
right hand on the Mother Earth.

1065
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:28,370
Good? May God bless.

1066
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,370
Good. Now, just see yourselves.

1067
01:11:52,745 --> 01:11:54,995
How are you? All right?

1068
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:58,495
Not yet, feeling?

1069
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,329
Good. Very good.

1070
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,953
May God bless you.

1071
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:47,245
Put your left hand here. Rub it.

1072
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:28,329
All right. Now see for yourself.

1073
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,620
All right?

1074
01:13:45,579 --> 01:13:48,162
May God bless you.

1075
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:57,579
Just put it on your head first, and then on your eyes.

1076
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:00,579
Good, nice.

1077
01:14:00,953 --> 01:14:04,495
Feeling fine? Shiny, eh?

1078
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,078
Little bit you can lift from this side, this one;

1079
01:14:21,495 --> 01:14:24,703
this side, yes.

1080
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,745
That’s all right.

1081
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:19,620
Done!

1082
01:15:20,203 --> 01:15:22,995
See yourself now.

1083
01:15:29,162 --> 01:15:32,162
May God bless.

1084
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,703
Has he washed?

1085
01:15:42,495 --> 01:15:44,620
Her husband?

1086
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:47,745
He’s washed My feet?

1087
01:15:48,537 --> 01:15:52,619
You both? Both are washed?

1088
01:15:53,745 --> 01:15:56,203
All right.

1089
01:15:57,412 --> 01:15:59,287
So, do you want to wash it again?

1090
01:15:59,661 --> 01:16:03,120
All right. Now come.

1091
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:09,120
Are you all right, Jeshua?

1092
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:14,162
Better.

1093
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:17,620
All right.

1094
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,162
Let him play with the water.

1095
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:34,203
Close his hands.

1096
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:36,995
Ask him to play with the water, would be better.

1097
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:40,370
In the water. Ask him to immerse his feet in the water.

1098
01:16:45,786 --> 01:16:49,953
Put it on Mine. Wash My feet.

1099
01:16:50,495 --> 01:16:52,579
Good, good, good.

1100
01:16:52,828 --> 01:16:54,745
Then touch My feet.

1101
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,870
Now put his hands on Mine.

1102
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:20,579
Good. Hallo! All right.

1103
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:28,661
So may God bless you all.

1104
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:31,537
He’s all right now.

1105
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:35,370
You have washed, both of you have washed.

1106
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,287
Just put more water.

1107
01:19:23,037 --> 01:19:25,953
Pour all that, I think.

1108
01:19:29,037 --> 01:19:31,620
And more is needed.

1109
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,245
That is better.

1110
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:42,412
Hundred-and-eight names.

1111
01:21:48,828 --> 01:21:52,203
You said hundred-and-eight names you have got.

1112
01:22:02,703 --> 01:22:05,620
Hundred-and-eight names.

1113
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,162
You showed Me thousand names you had.

1114
01:22:32,745 --> 01:22:35,370
These are …

1115
01:22:35,786 --> 01:22:38,911
hundred-and-eight.

1116
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:20,454
These are the hundred-and-eight names?

1117
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:26,287
Of Mahakali.

1118
01:23:30,579 --> 01:23:33,203
Oh, take a hundred names.

1119
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:38,661
It starts with Shri Mata?

1120
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:41,661
Take out that one, all right?

1121
01:23:49,745 --> 01:23:50,953
Sahasranama.

1122
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:53,995
Yes, we have Shri Lalita.

1123
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,537
This is the praise,

1124
01:24:05,828 --> 01:24:07,995
after the Goddess killed the two rakshasas

1125
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:09,953
called Shumba, Nishumba.

1126
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,703
They’re all again back on the seat.

1127
01:24:13,078 --> 01:24:16,745
So now the praise of the gods,

1128
01:24:17,203 --> 01:24:19,037
you have to do the same praise.

1129
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:21,329
Now, we’ll start – you know that

1130
01:24:21,745 --> 01:24:24,078
up to a point he will read it,

1131
01:24:24,537 --> 01:24:27,370
and then he will tell you that

1132
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:30,162
you have to put it “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”

1133
01:24:30,619 --> 01:24:32,995
– he’ll tell you “Buddhi” so you should put it,

1134
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,786
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Buddhi rupena samsthita.”

1135
01:24:36,162 --> 01:24:37,995
You know that – “Namas Tasyai namas Tasyai

1136
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,412
namas Tasyai namoh namah.”

1137
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:42,703
First he will say the beginning of it.

1138
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:45,911
This is how the gods, you see, praised the Goddess,

1139
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:49,495
when She killed Shumba, Nishumba. So ….

1140
01:26:53,745 --> 01:26:56,953
The first of all you have to give the – what you call

1141
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,995
– the ghee.

1142
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:01,619
But there is no spoon.

1143
01:27:02,037 --> 01:27:05,495
For ghee at least you have some spoons.

1144
01:28:09,162 --> 01:28:11,911
Also the moon.

1145
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,953
She’s like moon.

1146
01:28:14,329 --> 01:28:16,579
Face is like moon ….

1147
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,537
Just water.

1148
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:41,370
“Sarva” is the essence.

1149
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:44,620
She’s the one who’s the ruler of everything.

1150
01:28:57,203 --> 01:29:03,870
Extremely gentle, and extremely harsh.

1151
01:29:10,911 --> 01:29:13,786
We are the intelligence.

1152
01:29:16,245 --> 01:29:18,619
She’s the intelligence in every human being.

1153
01:29:18,995 --> 01:29:20,329
She’s expressed as intelligence,

1154
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,620
pure intelligence in every human being.

1155
01:29:33,995 --> 01:29:35,619
So you just say “Shraddha.”

1156
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,579
And now you repeat together.

1157
01:29:37,911 --> 01:29:40,537
You say “Shraddha” – now say.

1158
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,287
Should be sugar and then water.

1159
01:34:42,537 --> 01:34:44,745
Unmarried girls now.

1160
01:34:49,287 --> 01:34:51,828
Unmarried.

1161
01:35:42,828 --> 01:35:45,619
She used to do it always in Bombay.

1162
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,620
You also do it the same way.

1163
01:36:09,828 --> 01:36:12,120
Now.

1164
01:36:35,454 --> 01:36:36,579
You should say,

1165
01:36:40,245 --> 01:36:43,162
“Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namah.

1166
01:36:43,454 --> 01:36:45,495
Shri Mata Sakshat Shri …”

1167
01:36:45,828 --> 01:36:48,579
– what do you say?

1168
01:36:51,412 --> 01:36:54,120
Just say, “Om twamewa sakshat Shri Mata,”

1169
01:36:54,454 --> 01:36:55,870
that’s all – “namoh namah.”

1170
01:36:56,162 --> 01:36:58,619
Yes, that’s all. That’s all.

1171
01:37:03,661 --> 01:37:05,953
[Yogi: These are hundred and eight out of the thousand names

1172
01:37:06,329 --> 01:37:10,037
of Mahadevi given in the “Shri Lalita Sahasranama.”]

1173
01:37:48,078 --> 01:37:51,537
First is “Shri Mata.” So now say

1174
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,454
“Pataka nashini”

1175
01:40:52,745 --> 01:40:54,786
– killer of all the sins.

1176
01:40:55,162 --> 01:40:56,828
So that’s why I said, don’t feel guilty.

1177
01:40:57,287 --> 01:40:59,995
She’s the killer of all the sins.

1178
01:41:01,370 --> 01:41:04,245
Maha-pat: the greatest of –

1179
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:08,037
Maha-pataka nashini.

1180
01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:35,911
“Nistula” – means “uncomparable.”

1181
01:46:22,078 --> 01:46:24,287
You should first of all touch here.

1182
01:46:32,454 --> 01:46:35,162
First.

1183
01:46:56,495 --> 01:46:59,037
Go and wash your hands.

1184
01:47:05,537 --> 01:47:09,495
Unmarried women. Unmarried.

1185
01:49:52,037 --> 01:49:53,037
With the Para-shakti,

1186
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:57,203
all the work which it looks at all happens.

1187
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,078
“Yogada.”

1188
01:50:04,786 --> 01:50:08,329
I have given you the yoga, you see, the union.

1189
01:50:42,454 --> 01:50:45,454
“Labdhaa. Punya-labhya” – by the punyas.

1190
01:50:45,745 --> 01:50:49,454
You see, if you have no punyas, you cannot find any.

1191
01:50:50,537 --> 01:50:52,745
So if many people are lost, you shouldn’t worry;

1192
01:50:53,037 --> 01:50:54,995
they have no punyas. What can you do?

1193
01:50:55,412 --> 01:50:57,703
“Punya-labdhaa.”

1194
01:52:11,245 --> 01:52:14,619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati” – “Shobhana” means “gracious”,

1195
01:52:14,995 --> 01:52:17,703
“sulabha” means “easy” and by that,

1196
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:20,703
“gati” … “movement.”

1197
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:25,037
You get to the, your realization through

1198
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:26,619
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati.”

1199
01:52:26,995 --> 01:52:29,745
There is no disgraceful behavior,

1200
01:52:30,245 --> 01:52:32,661
or it is very beautifully done,

1201
01:52:33,203 --> 01:52:36,162
and also “sulabha” is “easy.”

1202
01:53:40,661 --> 01:53:44,203
“Shubha-kari” – Giver of auspiciousness.

1203
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:24,287
Not the red. No, not the red. Now, two.

1204
01:56:24,953 --> 01:56:27,203
Unmarried.

1205
01:56:37,162 --> 01:56:39,245
One, one person.

1206
01:56:39,619 --> 01:56:42,162
All right, all of you!

1207
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,953
All of you have to hold it in the hand.

1208
01:56:52,661 --> 01:56:54,953
Now, hold it in your hand, all of you, here.

1209
01:56:55,078 --> 01:56:56,786
Now from top.

1210
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,870
Yes, just hold it, right hand.

1211
01:57:01,287 --> 01:57:04,620
Hold it with the right. Here, one can hold it.

1212
01:57:07,037 --> 01:57:10,703
Now, put it.

1213
01:57:14,203 --> 01:57:17,037
So thank you.

1214
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:44,412
“Pasha-hantri, Pasha-hantri” –

1215
01:57:47,495 --> 01:57:49,370
You see, they are under bondage.

1216
01:57:49,745 --> 01:57:54,370
She’s the one who kills all the bondages, pash.

1217
01:57:58,078 --> 01:58:01,454
May God bless you.

1218
02:00:32,619 --> 02:00:35,620
“Vandaru-jana-vatsala”

1219
02:00:36,495 --> 02:00:38,703
– those who bow to Her,

1220
02:00:39,078 --> 02:00:45,412
She is … She is kind to them like a Mother.

1221
02:00:46,412 --> 02:00:48,078
She mothers them.

1222
02:00:48,412 --> 02:00:51,412
Those who bow to Her, She mothers them.

1223
02:01:38,703 --> 02:01:41,786
May God bless you.
