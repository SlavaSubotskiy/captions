1
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,690
Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany.

2
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,790
We have never yet

3
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,570
paid much attention to this center of Hamsa,

4
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,250
which is, I think, very important for the Western world,

5
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,730
rather than for the Indian or the Eastern.

6
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,130
The reason is, at the Hamsa chakra,

7
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,710
part of the Ida and Pingala

8
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,690
come out and manifest.

9
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,010
Means, the expression

10
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,110
of Ida and Pingala is given through the Hamsa chakra.

11
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,270
So this Hamsa chakra is the one

12
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,910
that, as if has not gone

13
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,690
up to the Agya,

14
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,730
but is holding on certain threads

15
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,430
or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala.

16
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,310
And they start flowing through your nose,

17
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,150
expressing through your eyes, from your mouth

18
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,430
and from your forehead.

19
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,010
So you know that Vishuddhi chakra

20
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,790
has got sixteen petals,

21
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,390
which look after the eyes,

22
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,390
nose, throat, tongue, teeth.

23
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,850
But the expression part

24
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,470
comes through the Hamsa chakra, of all
these. So

25
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,870
it's a very, very important thing

26
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,590
in a Western mind

27
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,330
to understand Hamsa chakra.

28
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,530
There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:

29
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,090
"Hansa kshveta ha, baka ha kshveta
ha.

30
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,570
Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho.

31
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,730
Neera-ksheera vivek e tu.

32
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,190
Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka
ha."

33
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,790
Meaning: "The crane and the swan, both are white.

34
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,810
And what makes the difference between the two?

35
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,870
If you mix the water and the milk together,

36
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,390
the hansa [swan, ed.] will just suck in the milk.

37
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,690
So it can discriminate between the water and the milk.

38
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,690
While the bakha, means the crane, cannot."

39
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,150
The very significant thing for Sahaja yogis to understand.

40
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,510
Discretion is to be understood

41
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,530
very deeply within ourselves.

42
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,910
And how we develop discretion

43
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,750
is very important in Sahaja yoga.

44
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,570
But before we go to that, let us see,

45
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:59,350
how this discretion plays a part, very much,

46
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,430
in the manifestation of our expressions out.

47
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,330
We are the people, in the West, who always try

48
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,910
to express ourselves outside.

49
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,610
It's very important how you look.

50
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,490
It's very important where you look.

51
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,450
What you look, what you see.

52
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,090
It's very important that

53
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,610
your appearance should be good.

54
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,930
Very particular, they spend lots of time in improving

55
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,830
their appearances. This is the minimum.

56
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,030
Then they have a method by which we call "the medias".

57
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,910
The country speaks or manifests through the medias.

58
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,530
And the medias have to have a training.

59
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,730
Every country has it's specialty,

60
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,730
one better than the other. And when you see all of them,

61
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,890
you find that they lack discretion completely.

62
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,450
Also in our speech,

63
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,990
in our expression of literature,

64
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,170
expression of poetry,

65
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,370
expression of our relationships with others,

66
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,030
any kind of expression requires discretion,

67
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,570
which is a deep-seated knowledge or wisdom.

68
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,790
If in the West people were not so much outside,

69
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,110
they would have been much better off, I think.

70
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,690
If, supposing, in England,

71
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,810
people don't become punks,

72
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,230
then others will laugh at them. And they'll think

73
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,470
that, "This man has no money to become a punk."

74
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,550
So kind of a fashion that sets in,

75
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,130
in a society of that kind, which has no discretion

76
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,650
and which is very outward.

77
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,110
Fashions won't work out in countries, where they are

78
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,890
deeply rooted into traditions

79
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,310
and into proper understanding of life.

80
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,530
Of course, the countries which have been very ancient,

81
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,690
have been traditionally trying to improve themselves

82
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,810
with "error and trial" and "error and trial" methods,

83
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,930
have developed much better discretion.

84
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,630
Much better understanding. But the countries which are

85
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,630
not gone through all that ordeal, have not worked out,

86
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,470
have not gone through that discipline, lack in discretion.

87
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,650
And that's why many of the people,

88
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,230
though they are of very deep seeking,

89
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,410
have gone astray.

90
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,670
If they had discretion, they would not have gone astray,

91
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,830
they would not have gone to wrong places, but the discretion

92
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,930
was missing.

93
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,970
So it comes to the discretion, how to use

94
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,470
your Ida nadi and Pingala nadi.

95
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,970
And discretion to understand what is good and what is bad.

96
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,250
Now let us see the Ida nadi.

97
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,190
Ida nadi is very important,

98
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,210
because the discretion in this can only come

99
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,950
through traditional understanding.

100
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,130
Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara.

101
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,510
So first we miss the biggest support,

102
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,550
the biggest help, the biggest nourishment

103
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,650
of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara,

104
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,590
if we have no discretion.

105
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,570
We always take to thing, which is detrimental to our growth,

106
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,410
and also which may destroy us,

107
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,210
not only us but the whole country.

108
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,330
We like people who are destructive,

109
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,330
when there is no discretion. Discretion means

110
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,630
that you must choose the things which are good for you,

111
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,550
which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective,

112
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,470
which are good for your ascent.

113
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,250
On the contrary, the people who have no discretion

114
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,790
fall into the traps of wrong type of people, like Freud.

115
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,230
I mean to an Indian, Freud... nobody can believe that

116
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,030
you can go into such a nonsensical idea.

117
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,070
But people accepted Freud

118
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,670
more than they could accept Christ.

119
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,470
Because the discretion was completely missing.

120
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,410
If they had that traditional discretion in them,

121
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,970
they would have been saved. This [type?] traditional discretion

122
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,270
is the thing that comes through Ida nadi.

123
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,010
Now, that's what they people call it, as "conditioning".

124
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,470
And they say that, "Conditioning is very bad. And people

125
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,570
should not take to conditioning. And one should be free

126
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,470
from conditioning." Which is absolutely
a wrong idea.

127
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,810
In that also, there has to be discretion.

128
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,370
What conditioning is good and what is not good

129
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,610
has to be taken.

130
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,850
Now, because there is no discretion about conditioning also,

131
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,130
outright discarding all traditions, all that is

132
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,150
coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers,

133
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,950
everything is discarded. The history is discarded.

134
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,910
And we say, "Oh, no, we are beyond it. We feel free."

135
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,370
Like I was surprised, yesterday in the plane
somebody told me,

136
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,310
"I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself."

137
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,290
I mean, if the clothes can imprison you,

138
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,430
then what happens to the real prisons, what will they

139
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,550
be for you?

140
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,730
But that sort of a funny idea

141
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,090
comes into the head of people and they think that,

142
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,310
"We can justify all this stupidity that we follow,

143
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,050
because we lack discretion."

144
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,250
Intelligence cannot give you discretion.

145
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,250
It cannot give you discretion as far as

146
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,970
the conditioning is concerned.

147
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,170
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand,

148
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,390
how you develop your discretion.

149
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,590
Yesterday only, I gave a very beautiful talk

150
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,990
to the ladies of Paris or, I should say, ladies of France,

151
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,770
regarding the discretion of women.

152
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,490
The discretion of the Ida nadi is intuition.

153
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,610
If you develop that discretion within you

154
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,350
through your meditative powers,

155
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,350
you develop intuition.

156
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,730
And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas,

157
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,290
which are surrounding you.

158
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,690
If you learn to take help from the Ganas,

159
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,510
you can become very intuitive and

160
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,890
without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing.

161
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,670
The whole of Sahaja yoga, I would say,

162
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,070
fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition.

163
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,750
For that, you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh.

164
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,310
Shri Ganesh in it's right sense you have to understand.

165
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,890
From there it starts, because he is Ganapati. He is the one,

166
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,750
who is the master, is the chief of all the Ganas.

167
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,390
So the Ganas give you the intuition.

168
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,570
For example,

169
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,890
say, I have to go somewhere.

170
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,810
And then I..., what I say is

171
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,970
that, "No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow."

172
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,150
And I won't go, somehow. And people think,

173
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,290
"Mother, how do You know?" I know,

174
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,350
because the Ganas are there, and what they say is the truth.

175
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,930
They know all about it.

176
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,590
Or anything I say about someone comes true.

177
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,170
So they start asking me, "How is it Mother,

178
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,610
You have come to know about it?" I live
on intuition.

179
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,430
Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition what's going

180
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,830
to happen. This part has to develop by worshiping Shri Ganesh.

181
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,250
So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules

182
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,650
a part of the Hamsa chakra.

183
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,450
So when we say Ham and Sa, these two are

184
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,930
actually the bija mantras of the Agya.

185
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,770
But when the Agya touches the Hamsa, it starts here.

186
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,470
That's why at the base, at the root of it, is the Hamsa.

187
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,130
And here the Ham, Ham means
"I am".

188
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,930
If you are discrete, you will not take to fashions.

189
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,590
You'll not take to stupid ideas. You have your own personality.

190
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,890
You are a Sahaja yogi. You don't listen to people,

191
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,090
who are non-Sahaja yogis.

192
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,170
That is the Ham part:

193
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,930
"I am". Not the ego part.

194
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,630
But the Ham - to understand that, "I'm a Yogi

195
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,850
and I know so many things, which normally people don't know,

196
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,910
and so I have nothing to do with them.

197
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,590
I've not to take any lessons from them.

198
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,670
They are not to teach me anything.

199
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,750
There's nothing that they know, I know much more."

200
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,710
To be aware of your Self is Ham.

201
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,150
So that comes from the right side, I would say.

202
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,050
The discretion of right side is Ham

203
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,010
and the discretion of left side is Sa.

204
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,230
Sa means "You", means:

205
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,330
"You are The One."

206
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,770
In your case you know, who is the "You".

207
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,230
But for every human being "You" is the Divine.

208
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,010
"You are The One." This comes

209
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,490
from the left side - is Sa.

210
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,210
So the word "Hamsa" is made of two types of discretion,

211
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,690
where to see "I am" and where to see "You are".

212
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,570
On these two balances - as they have shown here beautifully -

213
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,550
the Moon and the Sun.

214
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,790
In the center is the cross,

215
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,870
which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma.

216
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,070
How all these things are connected, one after another,

217
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,190
layers after layers; you can see how

218
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,010
dharma is connected with discretion.

219
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,810
Now there are people who are

220
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,050
suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual.

221
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,330
For example I've seen some Sahaja yogis,

222
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,830
they come to the Puja and they are giving bandhan to them, like mad.

223
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,610
On the way, they'll go, they'll give bandhan. Anywhere they go,

224
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,010
they'll give bandhan, like mad.

225
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,550
That's just conditioning. That's not discretion,

226
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,550
that's not Sahaja yoga.

227
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,190
It is to be seen - "Is it to be given bandhan or not?"

228
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,550
In the presence of Mother there is bandhan,

229
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,950
what is there to give bandhan to yourself?

230
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,970
The people, when I'm talking, are giving
bandhan,

231
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,690
raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think.

232
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,070
In the same way, there are people;

233
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,210
Yesterday I heard there's one kind of a music record,

234
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,290
is played everywhere in the ashrams,

235
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,190
because they can all jump like on a camel.

236
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,370
It's a music for the camels, you see.

237
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,510
Now, this record everybody appreciates. Why?

238
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,810
Because they can jump like a camel.

239
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,310
Once you start jumping like a camel, human beings can't give up.

240
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,930
They form habits. So they like that particular music.

241
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,070
They'll go on jumping like a camel, because now they have become

242
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,130
camels, they have to behave like camels. Now if there's something,

243
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,390
some music, which is like a horse,

244
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,970
like the trot maybe, maybe gallop, anything.

245
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,130
Now, once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that

246
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,170
rhythm. Now they become the horse, which is galloping.

247
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,090
Now the horse is galloping, they become

248
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,410
horses and they only like that galloping music.

249
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:28,890
So on and so forth. Could be a donkey, could be anything.

250
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,070
We are not animals, we are human beings and we are.

251
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,330
Hum - "We are".

252
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,710
We are Sahaja yogis, we are not dominated by any

253
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,890
particular type of

254
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:52,650
rhythm or particular type of music.

255
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,050
Every variety we can appreciate and understand,

256
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,690
as long as it is dharmic.

257
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,840
As long as it is balancing.

258
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,310
As long as it is auspicious and holy.

259
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:12,610
So you can see on the Hamsa how many things are judged.

260
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,330
I think, the whole of Sahaja yoga stands

261
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,450
on the balance of Hamsa.

262
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,850
There are people who are very

263
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,130
astute, means very honest.

264
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,830
But this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit.

265
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,430
Or else , there are people,

266
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,030
who are very hard working.

267
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,410
This can also go to the ridiculous limit.

268
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,830
So these qualities, which are supposed to be good,

269
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,010
cannot be righteous.

270
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,810
The righteousness is discretion.

271
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,630
Glorified.

272
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,730
If you have discretion,

273
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,850
then you glorify

274
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,070
that discretion into righteousness.

275
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,990
Like, we can say now, Christ. We can take Christ.

276
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,590
Christ was such a discretion.

277
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:43,330
When Mary Magdalene was stoned,

278
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,650
He had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean,

279
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,970
it's nothing to do at all, no relationship.

280
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,330
But He could see in discretion that these people had no business

281
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,890
to stone her. He stood up there,

282
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,330
in His own courage, and he said that,

283
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,170
"Those who are not committed any sin can

284
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,110
throw the stone at [My/Me?]."

285
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,230
This is the power of His discretion,

286
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,470
that people just felt that discretion within themselves.

287
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,230
And they felt that, "In discretion

288
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,530
this man is a holy man

289
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,310
and we cannot throw stones at Him".

290
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,450
If you are discrete as Sahaja Yogis,

291
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,790
you will make others discrete also.

292
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,510
Others will have to be discrete and to understand.

293
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,970
And this "Neera-Ksheera Vivek" is the differentiation

294
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,630
between the water [neera, ed.] and the milk [ksheera, ed.].

295
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,090
The bad and the good can come to you if you develop

296
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,250
that discretion part.

297
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,390
In Sahaja yoga, at every stage, you'll find people falter,

298
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,810
also with the right side indiscretion.

299
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,890
And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego

300
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,510
manifestation of people.

301
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,930
This ego is, as I said, is Ham.

302
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,650
This ego doesn't work, when it has to work.

303
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,970
For example, I find some people

304
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,650
went for a marriage in the church.

305
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,710
Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja yogis. We don't believe in any

306
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,750
human religions, you know that. All right,

307
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,490
you went to the church, is all right.

308
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,750
But they sent a lady to London

309
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,290
to buy "Laura Ashley" dresses.

310
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,690
To buy. And I think, also, maybe, some men must be

311
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:58,070
wearing tailcoats to do the wedding.

312
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,950
Where is that ego lost?

313
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,110
That ego that "you are the Sahaja yogi" was completely lost.

314
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,190
I think, they all went for hairdressing,

315
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,190
all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there

316
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,730
as old Christians,

317
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,330
walking to the church next to the graves

318
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,550
of stupid bishops.

319
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,990
It's not only here, India is much worse.

320
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,170
As far as religion is concerned, the left side,

321
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,230
they are very, very conditioned people, and there they

322
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,490
fail to understand, what is discretion.

323
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,410
For example, we had Gyanadeva. He was such a great

324
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,910
incarnation and He didn't even have shoes on His Feet!

325
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,810
And these days, they are taking out a big procession of palanquin,

326
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,550
so-called shoes in it - of Shri Gyanadeva -

327
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,430
and thousands and thousands of people singing praise.

328
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,470
Just imagine.

329
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,110
Who can tell them that, "Gyanadeva had no shoes!

330
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,650
What shoes are you carrying in the palanquin?"

331
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,150
And whatever village they go, or whatever city they go,

332
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,110
they are fed with sumptuous food;

333
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,250
everybody falls at their feet, "The saints have come

334
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,930
with a palanquin - " ...and the shoes never belonged

335
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,230
to Gyanadeva in it! So this madness goes on.

336
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,410
Now, you see all these things happening around you,

337
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,570
in every country, in every religion, in every

338
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,070
stupid area you see all this happening.

339
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,410
But you just join hands!

340
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,870
You become one with it!

341
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,330
And then it becomes so difficult

342
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,150
to understand, what has happened to you.

343
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,930
Now, this Ego, when used properly,

344
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,390
then it's discretion.

345
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,990
Now also people have another very horrid, horrid conditioning,

346
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,770
apart on the religion - is of the countries:

347
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,310
"I belong to India", "I belong to Germany",

348
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,490
"I belong to England." Everything is wretched.

349
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,790
I mean, to say something like that means

350
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,790
you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara land.

351
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,370
Those who start becoming

352
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,590
some nationality

353
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,730
do not know that your nationality is transformed.

354
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,430
Actually don't need any passports.

355
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,150
In the area where the Divine reigns,

356
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,870
no passport is needed. It's written large on your faces.

357
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,530
But still inside this deep conditioning is there

358
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,730
that, "I belong to this country, my country is
very great,

359
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,790
your country is not good."

360
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,110
But when it comes to discretion is to think

361
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,110
that, "All right, I was born in Germany

362
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,150
and Germany has made lots of mistakes.

363
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:35,150
Let me work it out, so that I get back all my German people

364
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,450
into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness."

365
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:46,590
There is, this conditioning is used in discretion.

366
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,690
In everything you will find there are two sides.

367
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,250
Which way you move is your discretion.

368
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,530
For example, there are people who have a conditioning

369
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,390
of a particular, say, a religion.

370
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,650
Supposing they belong to the Jew religion,

371
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,950
and have come to Sahaja yoga. Or they belong to Christianity

372
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,450
and have come to Sahaja yoga.

373
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,030
So now, what is the discretion?

374
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,330
As soon as another Jew person comes, or a Christian person

375
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,390
comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there.

376
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,110
And they all become great friends. Because "She's Jew, I'm Jew,

377
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,510
my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing...

378
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,930
Same with Christians, same with other communities,

379
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,870
same with any other nationality.

380
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:54,090
Now, what is the discretion, when you see?

381
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,630
The best thing, discretion at that point, is to see,

382
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,130
what are the faults of these so-called "human religions",

383
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,410
which are formed after the death of

384
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,910
the promoters, or we can say the incarnations,

385
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,790
or the prophets who started them. This is first discretion.

386
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,630
The second discretion is to read

387
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,610
those scriptures and find out, what is so special

388
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,950
that these incarnations have said. For I would say,

389
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,610
if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see,

390
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,410
what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja yoga is concerned.

391
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,430
If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out

392
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,710
whatever is written there as far as

393
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,790
Sahaja yoga is concerned, because Sahaja yoga is the Truth.

394
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,490
And what Truth is written has to be found.

395
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,170
If such a thing is developed, then you can go

396
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,650
further, if you are brave enough,

397
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,890
and can be courageous, to go and tell the people

398
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,010
that, "See, what is this nonsense you are following?

399
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,970
It's not written, it's not done.

400
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,230
Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing."

401
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,490
That's the third stage, where you have to use your discretion

402
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:27,490
as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.

403
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,870
Now when I am, say, in the

404
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,090
West, I have to discuss the West.

405
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,130
When I am in India, you must hear Me!

406
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,090
You don't understand the language - this is good for you.

407
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,250
You would lose all respect for Indians.

408
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,750
I give them left and right!

409
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,470
And tell them what's wrong with them. But here

410
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,690
it is important that much is wrong

411
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,310
with us in the West.

412
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,070
So the discretion is to see, what's gone wrong with us.

413
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,130
Where are we wrong. Have you got any courage or not.

414
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:13,210
For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside.

415
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,130
Why? Sometimes - doesn't matter.

416
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,630
When Indians can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also.

417
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,010
Or a man won't wear Indian dresses outside.

418
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,230
Is a little Hum is needed.

419
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,570
They enjoy it, but they won't wear.

420
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,910
They'll wear the same funny holey pants.

421
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,510
They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear

422
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,850
something that is sensible, is good to wear.

423
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,690
It's something that must give you the

424
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,470
idea that we are different people.

425
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,510
Now, this red mark is very important, because

426
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,450
then you don't catch any bhoots. And has to be worn.

427
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,890
In the Bible is written that, "There will be a mark on their heads."

428
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,950
But because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama

429
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,290
Hare Krishna - I don't think they wear any marks -

430
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,970
we are frightened of the society how to wear a mark.

431
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:25,090
But supposing they say that, "You go about with a dishevelled hair",

432
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,570
we'll do it. Because that's allowed in the society.

433
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,110
We are the people, we are not to be afraid of any society.

434
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,370
We have to come out of it, and we have to teach them.

435
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,670
Whatever is good we are going to do, whether you like it or not.

436
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,390
That's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint,

437
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,990
anywhere, they've gone all out

438
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,350
to say whatever is right and whatever is to be done

439
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,630
and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint.

440
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,930
Otherwise, if a saint sometimes gets dissolved

441
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,810
in the society, sometimes in Sahaja yoga, sometimes here,

442
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,390
then what's the use of such saints? Tell me any saint,

443
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,530
whom you know, who has not fought the society.

444
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,710
Who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society,

445
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,130
in a very loud manner, without any fear.

446
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,090
Have you known any saint like that? For Sahaja yogis

447
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,810
it is very important to have that courage within themselves.

448
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:31,470
If you develop your discretion, then it works out.

449
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,330
On the ego side, what kind of

450
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,590
a discretion you develop and how.

451
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,990
On the right side are all the Devas, all the deities

452
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,970
sitting around you.

453
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,130
You have to understand these deities.

454
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,890
You have to know what They are going to do. Supposing, now

455
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,410
you are lost on the way.

456
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,290
So, you should not think like all other people,

457
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,390
"Oh, I'm lost in the way, how will I go there,

458
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,390
what will I do?" After all, you are going for some nonsensical work.

459
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,510
Doesn't matter. You must think,

460
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,770
"Why? Hanumana, He must have brought me here for some purpose,

461
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,370
let's be on the lookout." Accept it.

462
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:25,130
Accept the situation.

463
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,810
When you accept the situation, you are playing into the hands of the

464
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,290
deities and they are guiding you. Your deities are working it out.

465
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,470
Accept it.

466
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,290
And this acceptance will give you

467
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,050
a wonderful discretion over to your ego.

468
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:50,470
Whatever goes wrong - "It's all right, we accept it."

469
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,210
And above all - the vibrations part,

470
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,850
which you have to see. If you do something,

471
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,010
if vibrations are going down,

472
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,050
then of course, "I am a Sahaja yogi.

473
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,330
To me vibrations and my ascent

474
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,090
is the most important thing."

475
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,330
So to develop the discretion on the right hand side,

476
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,310
you have to know your goal, your destination.

477
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,050
You must know on what path you are standing and where

478
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,110
you are brought, where are you today.

479
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,630
You are not like other people.

480
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,990
If that kind of a discretion you develop

481
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,170
within yourself, through pure intelligence.

482
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,350
For that you need pure intelligence.

483
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,910
And pure intelligence in a hamsa [swan, ed.] is that

484
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:53,170
it glides on the water.

485
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,370
It shrugs [off] the water.

486
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,570
It doesn't allow anything to overpower it.

487
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,230
It's in the water, beautifully beautifying the lakes,

488
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,430
also not allowing the lake to

489
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,830
dissolve them, or to overpower them, or to cover them.

490
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,650
This is the part where they are Ham.

491
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,950
If they want, they can dive down. If they don't want,

492
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,350
they will not. They're gliding on the ocean.

493
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,190
Ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhavasagara.

494
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,290
And they are not going to be drowned into it. That is the

495
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,410
Ham part of it, which you should have, the discretion.

496
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,330
On the one side, you should accept

497
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,290
things, when they come to you.

498
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,290
The best among these was Shri Krishna,

499
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,350
I would say, who had real discretion.

500
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,170
But, after all, He was Shri Krishna.

501
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,950
But His methods were so interesting of discretion,

502
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,650
that it's enjoyable to know about

503
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,270
how He destroyed so many rakshasas.

504
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,890
Every time He did not use His Sudarshan chakra,

505
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,210
He used his discretion. Like there was a rakshasa,

506
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,350
who was trying to overpower the Pandavas,

507
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,750
who was trying to overpower the people, who were good.

508
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,610
Shri Krishna

509
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,210
said, "Now, what to do with this horrible fellow?"

510
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,710
And this fellow had

511
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,230
boons from Brahmadeva and from Mahadeva and everyone.

512
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,410
So Shri Krishna is the center, after all,

513
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,030
so He wanted to organize

514
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:00,270
a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

515
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,310
So what he did, that

516
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,550
there was a great right-sided saint

517
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:15,270
meditating, and he had taken a boon

518
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,390
that, "Nobody should disturb me.

519
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,870
At least the one who disturbs me for the first time,

520
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,830
I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person."

521
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:32,150
And this one was meditating in a cave.

522
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,990
Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away

523
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,170
from the battlefield. His name is Ranchordas.

524
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,570
It's little... little bit derogatory [PEOPLE?] to say to somebody

525
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,770
that, "The one, who ran out of the battlefield."

526
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,810
So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield.

527
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,110
But there was no other way out to kill this horrible fellow.

528
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,170
And he went, and he was covering Himself with a shawl.

529
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,210
He went into that cave and

530
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,850
covered that saint with His shawl.

531
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,190
After Shri Krishna was running [away from] this horrible

532
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,090
rakshasa to kill him,

533
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,770
Shri Krishna went and hid Himself.

534
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,250
When this rakshasa came near the cave,

535
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:29,330
he saw the shawl covering this saint.

536
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,530
He said, "Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here,

537
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,650
running away from the field! Get up now!"

538
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,310
As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him.

539
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,870
And he was completely burnt away.

540
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,050
So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata at His Feet;

541
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,990
or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head,

542
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,430
in between the two resides Hamsa chakra.

543
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:16,210
The discretion is very beautifully described

544
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,150
in the life of Shri Krishna.

545
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,010
We can call Him that he had a naughty way of

546
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,370
using his discretion.

547
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,370
He has done so many things like that.

548
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:38,010
But they create a drama. They create His Leela.

549
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,170
Because He was Leela. That's why he could

550
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,970
use His discretion to create a drama or a play.

551
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,470
So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna

552
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,170
to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ.

553
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,330
In between is placed this Hamsa.

554
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,290
So we have two great incarnations within us,

555
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,570
who are the embodiment of discretion.

556
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,650
So one side is Shri Krishna,

557
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,930
who is the one,

558
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,770
who looks after the conditioning side of it.

559
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,790
And on the other side is Christ, who starts

560
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,950
looking after the ego side of it.

561
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,750
The One who says on the cross, "Oh, God, forgive them,

562
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,270
because they do not know. Oh, Father, forgive them,

563
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,670
for they do not know, what they are doing." Is the same One,

564
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,830
who takes a hunter in his hand and hits people, starts beating them,

565
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,570
because they are making money in the name of God.

566
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,570
See the discretion. That's Jesus.

567
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:53,090
Same Shri Krishna, who with his Sudarshan chakra

568
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:59,350
can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas,

569
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,290
becomes the driver of Arjuna.

570
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,250
The contrast of Their behavior

571
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:14,970
is the beautiful saga of Their discretion.

572
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,310
Now, for a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

573
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,530
that they have to work out their discretion

574
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,670
in a manner that they develop their intuition.

575
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,090
I would say the first thought could be the intuition,

576
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,690
could be the intuition. "Could be that this is intuition."

577
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,050
Try, experiment.

578
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,810
But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja yoga,

579
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,590
you have to do everything in moderation.

580
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,730
Like, I told them to see everything through vibrations.

581
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:01,250
So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything.

582
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,370
"Should I buy this sari or not?"

583
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,770
Even go beyond that: "Should I buy this

584
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,950
face powder or not?"

585
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,590
It's so ridiculous.

586
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,690
Is so bad, that ultimately you find you have become a bhoot

587
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,850
and you are telling everybody that your vibrations are bad.

588
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,310
Because your vibrations are bad.

589
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,790
Your attention is bad. Putting your attention

590
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,190
to nonsensical thing

591
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,830
makes your vibrations absolutely disappear.

592
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,410
So, with discretion

593
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,130
you must have common sense.

594
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,830
Practical sense.

595
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,410
I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody

596
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,690
about Sahaja yoga. No, it's not practical.

597
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,210
Sahaja yoga is a precious diamond, you cannot give it

598
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,390
to every person. I've seen people at the airport

599
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,870
raising Kundalini of everyone. No, it's not meant.

600
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,830
They have to come to Sahaja yoga. They have to ask for it,

601
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,590
they have to beg for it, then only they can get their Realization.

602
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:34,090
We don't want quantity, we want quality.

603
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,590
All My lectures, if you see in that, I've been insisting

604
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:44,450
on the quality of Sahaja yogis

605
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:47,670
and the quality of the seekers.

606
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:51,530
But when we start thinking of getting a majority

607
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,850
for a vote for Shri Mataji -

608
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,530
I have to say I'm not standing for any election.

609
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,350
Whether you elect me or not, I'm elected.

610
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:16,470
You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that.

611
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,570
And when you fail in discretion, you find

612
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,190
some problems develop.

613
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,570
Now, it is for you to find out, what indiscrete things

614
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,070
you have done, where have you gone wrong,

615
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:37,070
in which way have you done a mistake.

616
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,030
It is for you to find out, then rectify it.

617
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,090
Otherwise in Sahaja yoga there should be no problems,

618
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,130
there should be no ordeals,

619
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:53,470
there should be all joy and joy and joy.

620
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,690
But the discretion should be to find out,

621
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,450
what are your weaknesses,

622
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,790
where have you done wrong, what's gone wrong,

623
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:10,570
where, in what part and how we have failed.

624
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,050
Sometimes people think, "Oh, we did a lot at that time,

625
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,270
now we can't do it." Then you have failed.

626
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,470
Like I heard that people are saying, "Now we have come here,

627
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,530
so we'll not go to Guru Puja." It's wrong.

628
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,030
Very wrong. You have to come to Guru Puja, no question.

629
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:34,830
Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss.

630
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,750
Even if you miss Sahasrara is alright, but Guru Puja is

631
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,990
very important.

632
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:49,070
At any cost you have to come for Guru Puja.

633
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,530
I know I chose a place which is Andorra,

634
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,790
but it's not Himalayas!

635
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,830
Now the Sahaja yoga is so comfortable that we want

636
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:08,290
that there should be no change of flights.

637
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,690
Directly we'll sit on a hansa (swan, ed.) and we can [DO RIGHT?].

638
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,970
You will, you'll see that. But if you

639
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,690
develop a habit of thinking, "Oh, it would be difficult..."

640
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,890
then it will be.

641
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,630
But as Mother has said it, "It is going to be the easiest,

642
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,730
everything is going to work out."

643
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,090
Once you think like that, it will work out.

644
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,570
Everything will work out, but first there shoul'd be

645
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,070
pure desire to do it.

646
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,450
Whenever such ideas come into your head, again,

647
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,670
use your discretion.

648
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:56,270
We go to Guru Puja for our own health.

649
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,530
Every Guru Puja, if you remember,

650
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,190
you have come up very much higher.

651
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,310
Every Guru Puja has helped you.

652
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,710
Of course you say that, "Maharastra tour, that's very good."

653
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,590
I agree, it is - Maharastra tour helps you a lot.

654
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,270
But that's for thirty days, so intensive.

655
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,350
Guru Puja is only one day.

656
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:27,130
How many pujas you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine,

657
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:31,630
sometimes even ten. That's why.

658
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,450
Naturally it has to be much more effective.

659
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,850
But Guru Puja itself is extremely effective.

660
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,090
Indians have been asking Me, "Mother, once, at least once more,

661
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,710
give us the Guru Puja.

662
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,190
We'll do anything to have Guru Puja,

663
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,630
please come." This time they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine!

664
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,110
You could not have attended Guru Puja in India.

665
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:03,270
But Andorra, I have a special purpose.

666
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,350
I have a special purpose. So please understand.

667
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,470
I am not a purposeless personality.

668
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,770
Gradually you'll learn how I fulfill the purpose.

669
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,470
Yours, Mine and that of Sahaja yoga.

670
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,370
Together. How I work it out beautifully

671
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,110
you will understand, and

672
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,090
I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful

673
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,070
ways and methods of discretion, by which

674
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:47,410
you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing!

675
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,830
Now, for the treatment of Hamsa chakra, which is

676
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,930
more on the physical side - it's outside, that's why it has to be

677
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,150
much more on the physical side also.

678
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,890
So either we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well,

679
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,310
to put the Hamsa chakra alright.

680
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:15,130
Also, for Hamsa chakra it's important

681
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,590
not to kiss people.

682
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,970
I think kissing must be given up.

683
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,110
Because with kissing you do allow

684
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,130
the germs of another person. In Sahaja yoga it's alright.

685
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,370
But once I say that, that doesn't mean you go all crazy

686
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,490
with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India you go and kiss

687
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:40,230
somebody, he'll just be stunned. He'll not know, what is happening.

688
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,850
The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures,

689
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,070
the less it is inside.

690
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,690
The more you give expression, now for example,

691
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:59,410
there's a method of expressing "thank you."

692
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,110
And you go on saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

693
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,050
It's just a lip-service.

694
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,970
But many people in many countries don't say "thank you" at all.

695
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,510
But they are very grateful, inside.

696
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,450
The gratefulness inside creates the depth that is necessary.

697
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,150
So to do it superficially, anything, too much,

698
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,690
has to be avoided in your discretion.

699
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:37,030
But avoiding extremes,

700
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,450
avoiding too much outward expression,

701
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,490
again, can create another indiscretion like the English,

702
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:52,110
they don't speak, they just don't speak.

703
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:56,710
You travel with them every day for twenty-five miles,

704
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,170
sitting together; they will not say who you are.

705
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,570
They'll know each and everything about you,

706
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,990
but they'll just keep quiet.

707
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,910
They are not supposed to speak

708
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:13,730
- it's artificial. So the second point

709
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,450
we have to come to - we are not to be artificial.

710
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,050
It's alright, if somebody feels like, just out of just spontaneity

711
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,970
wants to love me, and hug me, I don't mind.

712
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,110
Because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most

713
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:34,670
spontaneous, they not artificial.

714
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,650
They are not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be

715
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:42,130
very natural about everything. It's alright,

716
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,910
while talking to each other, if the men hit the men a little bit,

717
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,790
doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love,

718
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,790
expression of love, is alright. But should be spontaneous,

719
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,710
should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality

720
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,990
in Sahaja yoga. At all, by any chance.

721
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,790
But wearing clothes is not artificiality.

722
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,270
To be decent is not artificiality.

723
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,070
To be dignified is not artificiality.

724
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,870
Artificiality is that what you don't feel inside,

725
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,990
is to say out.

726
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,230
That is artificiality and for Sahaja yogi, he feels

727
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,470
he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness,

728
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,430
he has that protocol and he respects his body.

729
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,550
Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something

730
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,750
that will insult his body.

731
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,530
And that's how if you understand how far to go

732
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,850
and how far to stop.

733
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,750
Then there is another way

734
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,430
of indiscretion in Sahaja yoga, which I have seen. Is that

735
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:59,570
people start using Me in many purposes, like that.

736
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:04,630
Like supposing, now, somebody's writing a poem.

737
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,810
So he'll come to Me, he'll say, "Please correct my poem."

738
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,950
I'll correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems.

739
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:16,370
Then he will lose the capacity to produce poems.

740
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,310
You should not use Me

741
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,190
for your own purpose in that manner.

742
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,710
But in any case you are using Me.

743
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,810
But with the understanding that, "Mother is all the time with me

744
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,290
and is helping me," there's no need

745
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,990
to come forward and jump on My time and to take My time

746
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,390
and to bother Me so that I should feel, "O God,

747
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:46,470
when will I get rid of this?" Or others have a thing, "Mother,

748
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,650
You must come to my house, You must take my child,

749
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:54,410
You must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard."

750
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:58,670
So taking attention to what you call "yours"

751
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,870
is also indiscretion.

752
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,130
Instead of that, you put your attention to Me.

753
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,670
Instead of taking My attention to you.

754
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,970
It's a very delicate line,

755
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,590
as if we are walking on a sword.

756
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:20,910
It's a very, very delicate line of discretion.

757
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:24,950
But once you know

758
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,530
as a state within yourself, you are discrete.

759
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,270
You cannot be indiscrete even if you want to be.

760
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:37,330
And that is what is the ascent part. So once

761
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:40,490
you come out of this chakra

762
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:45,270
and pass through your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara,

763
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,910
where you have to be discrete.

764
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,850
Whatever then comes out from there - blessed,

765
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:57,450
whatever expression comes out, blessed, from the Sahasrara,

766
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:01,630
is all discrete and beautiful.

767
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:06,510
Some people have a habit of dominating Me also.

768
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,350
Like I'm talking, they'll talk in between.

769
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,310
I am saying something, they will come forward.

770
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:18,210
Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing tricks.

771
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,410
But I'm very discrete, it's alright. My discretion

772
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,070
plays the tricks. Because if I am direct, you won't like it.

773
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,910
So better be discrete and play tricks.

774
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:35,590
In everything that we do, discretion expresses itself.

775
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,610
And if you are a solid Sahaja yogi or a Sahaja yogini,

776
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:43,090
your discretion is evident and

777
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,250
everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there.

778
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:52,030
So for all of you it is important to develop your discretion today,

779
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:58,330
and to ask me to reside in your Hamsa chakra,

780
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,250
so that you are all the time stationed

781
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,210
in the power of discretion.

782
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:09,010
With discretion we have evolved to human state.

783
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:14,350
And to go further, we have to develop our innate discretion,

784
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,610
which I think is the essence of all the religions,

785
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,530
of all the adventures we have had,

786
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,870
of all the lives which we have known,

787
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,730
is the discretion around which everything moves.

788
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:33,330
May God bless you.
