1
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:21,917
Today is very bigger day for us,
also 'vasant panchami' is there

2
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:26,567
Again it's national day today

3
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:31,432
The people are grateful to see this day

4
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:34,567
How many people had abandoned their life?.

5
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:41,936
How many things have happened,
but we have not yet come to that stage.

6
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:49,739
Where you know this,Yes,
the country is of great

7
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:56,247
importance,People have
won the sacrifice.

8
00:16:56,272 --> 00:17:00,836
Even when we called up
the rebellion in this

9
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:06,041
country, Gandhiji thought
that this country's

10
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:11,763
That which is real wealth,
it is spiritual.

11
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:15,485
Self-power is not violent
but non-violence, and

12
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,256
therefore they will make
all over non-violence.

13
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:23,503
We have won the country for
without any violence

14
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,708
When this happened,
we do not realize that

15
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:31,534
Now this is what we have
earned so much wealth,

16
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, that's what we keep,
Yes, you has got diamonds

17
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,642
In Which sacrifice to fit?

18
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:44,737
So that's what it's sacrificing
They must be of this soil

19
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:51,556
Whatever the sacrifice of this soil,
They have sacrificed themselves.

20
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:53,244
You have nothing else to do.

21
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:56,070
What is the main thing in
this country,that is, all the

22
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:58,745
space that is the element,the
power of self, it is..

23
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:03,246
That should be discarded on self-power.

24
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:08,157
As long as the sacrifice of independence
will not be put on self-centeredness,

25
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,056
The welfare of this country will not be there

26
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:16,053
But for that, we should create such a people,
which has received this self-discipline.

27
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:22,677
But I still see that the people that got self-conscious
Who has gained self-confidence

28
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:31,946
They are still playing very tightly and
are living with a very frantic situation.

29
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:37,669
The kind of thing that has happened to
me is so troubled me yesterday

30
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:41,652
I have decided that I do not want to
talk about that anymore.

31
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,627
Relations,How did it come?

32
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,875
We say relation come in Maharashtra.

33
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,127
Brothers kill you after one another

34
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:55,381
Something bothered, what happened to it?

35
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,249
That's because we took addiction.

36
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:01,318
You might be surprised if
you add some additives to

37
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:03,994
Vishuddhi chakra,
you do not have any kind of wisdom.

38
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:05,903
He does not live nicely.

39
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:11,904
He lied and did not think he had
missed anything even though he did

40
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:17,657
This addiction has grown so much in
our country and it's on such a large scale,

41
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,156
People do not notice that they are suffering,

42
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,659
People say so many lies about.

43
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,906
They are behaving so badly.

44
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,907
And so much lies are in the world

45
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,407
Yes, for the first time
to get rid of falsehood,

46
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,652
first of all should be
left with addiction.

47
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:39,972
The man who does not completely forget to addiction,
His nature will not be good.

48
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:48,472
He will do falsehood, he will do a false thing
and everything that is true will be false

49
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:53,973
So one day on this big day many
people spend their lives

50
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,559
Many gave life

51
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:58,124
Many have shed their blood

52
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:05,698
From this time immemorial, we struggled for independence,
now for self-rule, to self-help

53
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:10,284
People today pledge that we will
not do any addiction anymore

54
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:11,285
Any kind

55
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,283
This is not a difficult task

56
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:17,035
I see people from foreign countries
that they are so sharp

57
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:21,036
Once that is achieved, on the next day
it becomes free, by leaving everything,

58
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:23,790
That was not what they were

59
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:28,293
As soon as a lotus comes up in a moment,
it gets so much sweeter

60
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,287
But not in our country.

61
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,034
There are some types of activities in our country

62
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,664
But this is the only way,
It's gonna be there.

63
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:39,665
For ten ten years, peoples in sahajayoga
Why not make some progress?

64
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:44,164
The reason is that they have not been
able to relieve themselves of addiction.

65
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:46,663
This slavery should gone

66
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,630
The slaughter of addiction is that it should go.

67
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:52,124
The second guru's slavery is very terrible to you

68
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:54,627
I met a gentleman yesterday

69
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,374
They were so many years in sahajayoga.

70
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:58,629
But his master's slavery is not gone

71
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:00,627
So they are still in trouble.

72
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,377
There is no one listening to these things

73
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,884
Nobody would believe it.

74
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:10,373
But if your guru is wrong, then you have
seen that you are suffering from it

75
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:12,881
This slavery,
Should have gone

76
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:18,135
You should keep in mind that for slavery,
People who come from Guru.

77
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,224
They are physically afflicted

78
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:26,473
If your master can not keep your body properly,
then why should such a guru be enslaved?

79
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,478
This is superstition and it is a vengeful sign.

80
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:34,589
In the vengeful symptom, Shrikrishna said,
that when a person becomes vengeful

81
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:38,088
Then some unfixed things are
pulled up completely

82
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,085
That condition only believes the truth

83
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:49,087
Suppose,one bull tie to the oil extractor poll
and put scarp on eyes,He is wandering in there

84
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:53,186
And no matter how much you told him
that he is wrong, he does not think so

85
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,685
It do not go into his head

86
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,938
This vengeful tendency is
especially in our Maharashtra.

87
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:02,436
The reason we tell him the reason
is that we are very addicted

88
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:06,936
And the fundamentalists, in those days
we have grown up in the customs,

89
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,576
You never stop that fundamental.

90
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:14,949
Now first of all, see that you should fast now

91
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:17,312
Who said that? Which scripture?

92
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,316
If no one says so, no one can show.

93
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:22,784
If you have a passion to fast anytime.

94
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:26,907
So whoever you wish about will be the same.

95
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:30,656
People in our country are also starving

96
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,653
Why should I fast even more,
I do not understand,

97
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:40,049
If you would like to fast,then die

98
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,413
It seems like the future will be hungry,
want fasting, take it.

99
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,413
You should only get
what you are interested in.

100
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:52,752
When you fast,
Then let it be hungry

101
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:54,755
Then why cry?

102
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:59,021
Everything is for eat and they
do not want to eat it in the name of God

103
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:02,025
You should not eat it,
but eat it in the name of God

104
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:05,524
Next is the path of devotion,
the path of devotion has drawn one

105
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:08,016
But that's not the way it's going to be

106
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,266
It should be noted

107
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:14,136
devotion, exclusive devotion is told by Krishna

108
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:20,637
The path of devotion is to sit on the ground,
to walk away from it

109
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:23,385
Dress clothes, like beggar

110
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:27,841
Going there playing the Manjeera,
And to break the head

111
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:28,967
That is called the devotional path

112
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,463
Who said this?

113
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:41,837
Dnyaneshwar did not say that you used to go to
perform 'Hare Rama' Hare, doing there.

114
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,585
Or do we say Vitthal Vitthal
by doing Krishna Krishna

115
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:47,838
So do not go anywhere

116
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:53,194
Those who wrote it did not read

117
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:55,692
They did not understand
what they explained

118
00:23:55,692 --> 00:24:01,567
Now it is said that, 'Aata Vishwatmake...Toshawe'.

119
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:05,322
He should show the spirit of the universe

120
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:07,810
He should be happy

121
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:13,215
Whatever sacrifice has been offered to me,
Let's be satisfied

122
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:17,576
And then what to give?
Give it to Pasaydan

123
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:20,198
This pasaydaan is given to you.

124
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:24,694
This is what the vibrations have been
given to youvthis is pasaydaan.

125
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,695
The dark darkness of sinful man
disappeared,did gone?

126
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:33,653
Those who played majeera,
Does ignorance go?

127
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:39,906
Too dry, dried, beggar
they do not have proper clothes on body.

128
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:43,653
Seeing the person coming to cry
Where did the sinful man come from?

129
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:47,293
And say we are devotees of Shri hari !

130
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:56,143
Hey, who gave Sudama to Dwarka,
this devotee, this beggar people

131
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:00,875
Why are you people defaming Krishna?

132
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:04,873
Be a devotee of another person,Fraud Babaji's

133
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:09,124
Whose rinkle should be counted,
This type of Babaji are many

134
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:11,624
Devote them.

135
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,262
But why do you defame Shrikrishna?

136
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,762
Where did you not read the
description of their face?

137
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,011
Did not read the description of his brilliance?

138
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:24,512
Where he was a beggar, nobody told.

139
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:30,263
Even though cows maintained,
the crown was on the head.

140
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,752
We have already heard of it ,
about dress up

141
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:36,993
Where did you hear that he was
carrying a bush in his hands beggar ?

142
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,462
Tobacco filled in drink

143
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,483
This is our condition

144
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:50,383
But do not think about it,
And black ash on the head

145
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,134
does he apply black ash on head

146
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:59,382
How pretty even,Turns the sandal on the head

147
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:07,432
That was his sign,even if you look around,
why do you walk around with black ash?

148
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,818
With those black ashes,
 it will ruin your ajnya chakra.

149
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:13,681
The more you will be in a vengeful perspective.

150
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:19,094
But you said that Mataji,
why do you say so?

151
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:23,672
That is what they want me to tell
and it should tell you

152
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,962
Then you got the disease
tomorrow, there were cancerous

153
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:28,171
diseases, there were diseases
of the vishudhhi chakra

154
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,672
Diseases like this,The disease happened
That is to say,Mataji what's this?

155
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:37,313
We are Warkaris(devotee),
that is to blame in God

156
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:40,312
This vengeful tendency should have gone

157
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:44,303
Walk through the scarf on the eye.
We are in the path of devotion

158
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,773
Hey, what's the way?

159
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,775
God has said, Make exclusive devotion

160
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,322
Krishna has explained it
clearly,That you will give

161
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:54,772
me something,pamphlet,
fruit, and he will take it

162
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:58,025
But giving it clear that you should
give exclusive devotion

163
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,522
What else could he do?

164
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,522
When will exclusive devotion be?

165
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:06,002
When you walk aloud with God

166
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,047
When you feel confident

167
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:11,257
Whenever you worship him,
it has something meaning

168
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:15,244
We have such an evil
reputation of Krishna everywhere

169
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:18,242
Are doing abroad,
doing so here too.

170
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:22,744
Where is Lord Krishna and
where are the people of Warakari(devotee).

171
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:25,969
I do not see the compilation of the two

172
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:38,046
So, whatever we are old, we want
to get the best, best of them

173
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:41,293
And that which has been imposed on us,
it should be left

174
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:45,301
In the Sahajayoga,
we are doing great devotion

175
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:49,216
Everything happens,
but only after self-realization

176
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:51,016
Before that we did not do it.

177
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,767
Secondly, fasting is not what we do

178
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:57,019
If you want to fast,then do it,
Now I am fasting already

179
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:01,762
I Forever Fasting is done by your grace

180
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,763
No lunch, no meal in the evening

181
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,516
Something is going on

182
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:09,514
If you do not want me to
fast then I can do it

183
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:14,019
But even if you want to do it,
you can do it for yourself or for your body

184
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:17,264
But do not tell it as a stomach disorder

185
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:23,018
So we need to understand that
we are going to be vigilant,

186
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:26,265
Now we do not want to
go to the royal state

187
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:29,767
This peopole is other
it is of a political nature.

188
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:34,477
What they did not know,
what was wrong and what was good

189
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:36,479
The mistake and the good one at all

190
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:39,227
That is, we feel that these
people are human or animals !

191
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:45,477
They do not understand this, that
they eat cabbage, that they eat shit

192
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:49,477
He also does not understand the difference,
People are royaltyers

193
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:54,725
And if this state of the state came,
But a big question arises in him

194
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:59,229
Because such people are
confused and completely confused

195
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,299
So do not understand what
they want to explain

196
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,295
So everyone thinks,
what's wrong with this?

197
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:09,171
Now here London is a new one,
Exiting daily.

198
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,667
Now there's a new one

199
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:16,666
The new one happened for four years,
That needle socks into your mouth

200
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:24,374
If not, then insert the pin
And paint the hair and go out.

201
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:29,375
I said, why do this? they said,
So what's wrong with this?

202
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:34,123
What's wrong with this?
Does we have any answer?

203
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:40,767
So they do such foolishness

204
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:44,856
It does not matter if you say
anything to that stupidity

205
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:46,853
Because they think, we all know

206
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:47,608
What's wrong or bad?

207
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:49,095
What do you say?

208
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:52,180
That is, the monsters are
good, the evil is also good,

209
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:55,121
the thief one is good and
the Mahatma is also good.

210
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:58,592
And God is good. Everything is good,
all are same.

211
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:02,093
Hitler is good and krushna is also good.

212
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,735
There is no difference between them

213
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,734
No one should say bad .all good

214
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,731
There is nothing bad to say

215
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:09,486
This was the stage of royalness

216
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:11,486
You now have the royal nature

217
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,235
Because you are making progress now

218
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:15,987
Due to the progressive country you are

219
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:19,736
Now there is a humble request that
you should not progress there

220
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,739
Now we have to make such progress right now

221
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,690
She wants to progress
through the Crown Chakra and

222
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:30,511
That is to make progress
in the higher direction

223
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:33,737
For This,What's wrong with this?
What's wrong with him?

224
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,452
Why do this?
why do that?

225
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:38,459
If that desire were to happen, we would have
thought that we became a royal

226
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,956
It's worse than vengeful.

227
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,483
Because once you can remove
bond,But by the way, From the

228
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:50,479
point of view, the restriction on the
eye, how to remove it?

229
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,205
So,do not go to that situation.

230
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,203
What's wrong with this
What's wrong in him

231
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:58,953
You are your master in Sahajayoga.

232
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:03,460
Vibrations come in your hands and
you know what's wrong with you

233
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,143
Then,Fix Your Vibrations.

234
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:08,405
But there is a situation
where people do not understand

235
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,166
anything, whether we
have lost anything or not

236
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,649
This situation should not occur

237
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:18,648
That is my request by adding my hands

238
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:25,901
Today, in this good news, we all have to tell
you that you are born in this holy soil.

239
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:29,899
I now go to Coimbatore day before yesterday,
they said that you will live in Pune now ?

240
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:31,648
It is said to be punyapattanum.

241
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:33,645
All said by adding their hands

242
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:44,648
Said, 'Why?'
... now you see it all

243
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,395
This is what they were .it was
what they were described

244
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:58,476
This story tells us that once Pundarikaksh
took his father and mother

245
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:00,895
Came to Mumbai city.
Maybe even Pune has come

246
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:02,646
There is a story about Pune.
Do not know if there will be any.

247
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:06,645
He said to them,
'I'm not taking you anywhere now.

248
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,588
I have served you very much

249
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:11,334
Now,I'm not going to take you forward
Go where you want

250
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:17,709
I am not doing your pilgrimage anymore.
He thought, saw the vaibrations and said

251
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,455
That's it, do it

252
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:23,205
You take us out of here anyhow

253
00:32:23,454 --> 00:32:29,207
Then do what you want to do,
As he picked it out of that village, he came to notice

254
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:32,206
That's how much is my fault,
He said, forgive me

255
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,457
Something happened to me

256
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:38,956
No, no, I take you away,
Well, I think this often in Pune

257
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,452
Mumbai has so much

258
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:46,953
But now people should decide that,
to pune

259
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:52,457
Which Graduation is given from Anadikal
The great saints, great masters

260
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:55,705
will celebrate and will do it well

261
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,936
Today,All of this should be decided in
the mind of the people of Pune

262
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:06,185
That's the name of Pune, that's such a great name,
we get such a great principle

263
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,437
what others do?

264
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:12,178
Others do this,Others do thieves, they do this,
do not want to see others. Others Others

265
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,761
You are ours.

266
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:22,297
What attitude do we leave,Except for small attitude,
we can absorb big ideas

267
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:26,754
Secondly, we have the biggest problem
in religion

268
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,528
Today,have to say about that also

269
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:35,905
It is written by Markandey Swaamy about
the idea of ​​caste from Anadikal

270
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,732
Which is called as consciousness
in all the beings of the

271
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,625
Goddess The Goddesses who are
situated in power in all castes,

272
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,447
That's what we say every day,
But why we dont understand?

273
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,297
Means,Whats goddess cast,
that is our cast

274
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:49,868
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati are
only three caste in this world

275
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:53,382
And the fourth caste is Aadishakti's,
that's your caste.

276
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,187
It's Beyond that

277
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:59,754
Those who are passionate,
their cast of Mahakali's

278
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:04,226
Mahasaraswati's caste for
those who are of Royal

279
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:07,401
Those who are righteous,
their castes are Mahalakshmi

280
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,807
There are three castes in this
way and the fourth which is

281
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:16,012
going on is beyond the castes,
that is to say,Trigunatit

282
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,283
In this situation you are sitting today

283
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:22,438
So do not fight on castes

284
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:26,918
We are this,we are that,this,that,
Those who really do not really do anything

285
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:32,407
With such a brawl,then we say that
why we have given the kingdom to them?

286
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,001
Means Shivaji was
kunabi(lower cast)

287
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:35,560
Why did give the kingdom?

288
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:36,736
There are many people who say so

289
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:42,252
Now who is sitting on your kingdom?
Parsi is a man coming and sitting,Tell him

290
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:50,085
Came all Brahmins and say.tell,
They become friendly with all

291
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,590
That man is good
But its meaning

292
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,794
Who has said that?Even if Shivaji Maharaj is in situation,
you give him trouble

293
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:04,224
also told Gandhi ji that you
make atonement at Nashik

294
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:09,010
You make atonement,
from such a great man

295
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:13,029
I once said to Mahatmaji,
'Why do you go to make atonement?

296
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,474
He said,If I did not go,
they would've shot mi

297
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,299
Whom did you give up?

298
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:25,416
You must remove people from that class,
and this is the idea that you have

299
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,258
That is, showing others down in religion

300
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:35,404
Every time that big people were there
Everyone in this country tried this

301
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:39,373
That people should remove
this idea from their minds

302
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:41,809
eknath feeds water to donkey.

303
00:35:42,214 --> 00:35:44,054
Naamdev was a tailor.

304
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,253
We had a gentleman butcher

305
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:49,160
He is considered to be a saint.

306
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:51,687
Tukaram also always used
to say that If I had

307
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:55,575
become a Mahar(lower Caste),
it will good for mi

308
00:35:55,982 --> 00:36:01,509
Why this?That is, they are often told that
this madness of caste should be gone

309
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,987
And so many miracles happened

310
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:07,023
Their Volume came out in the Indrayani(river)
which was immersed, all happened

311
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:09,198
But people have not understand that

312
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,875
The thing which is holy is different,
the fight between castes is different

313
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:15,962
They will not learn because
the eyes are close

314
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:20,152
So this kind of caste does not work for us,
We do not want that kind of caste

315
00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:22,756
We will not do this,
we will not do that

316
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,493
Such people who speak,
And in this way the people who spread the atmosphere

317
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:32,919
There was a defect only in our country

318
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:36,372
Well, it still needs to be done in practical terms

319
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:39,535
that,some caste boy married with another caste girl

320
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,249
There is no difference between them
and this kind of marriage, but they have advantages

321
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,817
Suppose,If you married in your caste
and did Maratha in Marathas

322
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:53,666
So, he has not sent anything to Diwali.

323
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:58,952
How much did dowry?To talk properly,
How much did dowry?

324
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:03,444
I want to get married,
then the girl should be the same

325
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:08,101
If someone tricks her,
then who will come from the community?

326
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:10,715
f you send the girl home,
if didnt give dowry,, But at

327
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,752
that time can someone is
standing in the community?

328
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:18,411
Dies For such castes,
oppressed people torture their girls

329
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:22,602
Not only that, I feel that one of
those media is atrocity.

330
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,520
The girls used to abuse and
torture to them

331
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:29,005
It must be married in this caste,
This is a medium

332
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,822
It is a medium to
persecute those girls

333
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:37,284
We are harassing ourselves,
our own, our girls every day.

334
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:44,057
If another son got good,If you got good in
the others caste, then what is the problem?

335
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:46,872
What should be the problem,
there is no objection

336
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,386
But it does not look like that

337
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,416
It is not so practical

338
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:55,473
But tomorrow in that caste left our
daughter, So that being helps you

339
00:37:55,492 --> 00:38:00,155
Even when it appeared front of us,
we got married in our own caste only.

340
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,662
Stubbornness like this

341
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:08,154
That is,You really have
something radish on girls head

342
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,628
We're putting a lot of weight

343
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,093
If you want to, you can do it in
your caste If you want,return it.

344
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:17,823
But why do you bother that girl

345
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,657
Troubled her
tomorrow,mother-in-law troubled her

346
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:24,233
You do not go and say
that we married in a caste

347
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:27,521
n it you will have a reputation for
being 'we married in our caste'

348
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,640
What are you going to get?

349
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:31,580
Why do you get?

350
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:35,186
It is special in womens

351
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,102
That should be in our caste

352
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:41,674
So you have to showoff something after
that What you get? i do not understand.

353
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:44,190
Gandhiji tried.

354
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,008
Tilak made efforts before Gandhiji

355
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:49,329
Tilak married widow himself

356
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,958
Agarkar did

357
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:57,108
How many people have tried,
but we have not fulfilled that effort

358
00:38:57,656 --> 00:39:02,846
Now, when it comes back to sahajayoga,
do not have to do things like casteism

359
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:05,215
We do not believe in caste.

360
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:08,573
We consider only cast.
that is sahajayoga.

361
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:12,056
Sahajaogya is the story of World religions

362
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:18,079
This is a world religion and there
is nothing like casteism, hatred etc.

363
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:22,440
A single God and all the
people of mankind he created

364
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,155
Those who have achieved God now,
when they enter the kingdom of God

365
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:28,028
Do not take it there,
mad people from here.

366
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:31,025
bawannakuli(caste) and this and that

367
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:42,772
A gentleman said to me,caste(kul) .talk about
caste mataji, i said ..caste..you have a big.

368
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,784
caste come from where ?

369
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:47,869
Who is your goddess, from there

370
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,199
That is, the goddess came back or not.

371
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:52,236
Which is your kul(caste)?

372
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,846
If we are of any caste,
our Goddess may be one.

373
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:58,869
Suppose someone's goddess is Jagadamba.

374
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:05,112
hen it can be of a goldsmith or a Brahmin.
it can be Maratha's, anyone can be.

375
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,659
That is, whether their caste
is for Jagdamba or not.

376
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,977
That is, the kul(caste) became Jagdamba's

377
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:14,120
We have Kul(caste) from the Goddess

378
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:16,191
Not from the God

379
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:20,584
That is, the identity of the kul(caste)
is known on mother, and it is also true

380
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:26,228
Thats why we say 'ya devi
sarvabhuteshu,jatiru pen sansthita'

381
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:28,586
It's your caste,
This is your caste of greatness

382
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,154
Now I ask what is
the kul(caste) of Shivaji?

383
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:32,805
No one can tell.

384
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:35,592
One might say, Jagadamba,
someone would say, Bhavani

385
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:37,140
Bhavani was his mother.

386
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,601
They have a kantyayani.

387
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,291
kantyayani was his kul(caste).

388
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,394
kantyayani was his
goddess kul(caste).

389
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,300
Now, whether it is the Casteism of
their caste or not, do not know

390
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:46,841
this is Casteism.

391
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:47,856
This is kul(caste).

392
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:49,158
This is the greatness of kul(caste).

393
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:53,656
To get something done,that we are this
much kul(cast) and that much kul(caste)

394
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,997
Type something that does not look like

395
00:40:55,045 --> 00:40:56,846
All will come together in drinking alcohol.

396
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,644
If everyone wants to drink alcohol,
then they all sit together and drink.

397
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:01,596
Same place

398
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:05,588
When drinking,So what
do we drink alcohol?

399
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:09,898
But at the time of drinking water,
we wear holy clothes.

400
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,380
Even if you want to have cigarettes

401
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:18,225
If you have half your
remaining thas is also fine

402
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:24,233
But at the time of meal, however,
we are very considerate of others.

403
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:27,637
That is, if you want to
work in a bad way, you want

404
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:30,308
to make a thief,can anyone
ask what's your caste?

405
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:34,111
When stolen, they form a team

406
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:37,119
When all kind of people steal together

407
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:38,557
ame is politics

408
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:42,626
Nobody in politics thinks
that, what is your caste?

409
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,634
When all bad people come
together that means politics.

410
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:49,719
But you have to find out
how much you are really bad

411
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:52,124
Very bad people

412
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:55,410
So this is ours,
just got it right with us.

413
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:05,319
This is the situation today that
you have nothing about yourself

414
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,817
There is no self respect,Because
if there is no demonstration

415
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,314
of self, then self respect
can come from where?

416
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:15,371
It is worthless to say
that things are worthless

417
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,783
Those things have become so important

418
00:42:18,181 --> 00:42:20,252
There is no attention
to the real things.

419
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,585
It's a vengeful symptom

420
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:26,637
And this vengeful sign should go through
you, so you have tried your best.

421
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,661
The vengeful person does not
have any respect for himselfo.

422
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:34,702
He does not think about himself.

423
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:39,277
I have some self-respect or
should I have some self-respect

424
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,178
And his whispering all time

425
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,805
whispering about him,
whispering about them

426
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:47,448
Something slayess,
which is called in English,like he did

427
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,027
From here and
there,his whispering

428
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:51,218
slayess

429
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,377
Likewise,
the royal man is a terror but open

430
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:58,647
Openly,
the two ,four will slap you

431
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,546
If someone gave him two or four, he would
give two-four back, but he would openly

432
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,189
his all apparent

433
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:06,332
That is so much that .....

434
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:08,578
It is open to sin,
what is bad in it?

435
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:10,808
What is worse than doing it?

436
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,878
What's wrong with that?.
say this

437
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:15,725
If you want to do anything,
then there is no such thing in it

438
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,416
In all things,
what is wrong with it.

439
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,509
The other is ashamed to see them.
It is a condition

440
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:25,218
So what is your
situation, That you know

441
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,195
Know what is your cast

442
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:31,284
And any caste has been
exhausted, means you Drowned.

443
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:36,617
Then it should be multiplied
beyond this species

444
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:44,343
It should be done in a multiply. And you
must be self-confident in that situation

445
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:47,089
His richnees should be seen in him

446
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:52,596
The second symptom of Sahajayoga is that he
should always look happy, he should look cool

447
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:56,147
Kabirdas said, what do you say,
when you are happy?

448
00:43:57,275 --> 00:43:59,275
If you do not have fun

449
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,933
Then you are not sahajayogi.

450
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:06,934
If you find this,
We will do anything that Mataji said

451
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:09,897
I have seen many people like this.

452
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:12,001
I said, what are you doing?

453
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,580
One thousand people will come.

454
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,103
How can we do it?
Mother, we will take one thousand or three

455
00:44:17,128 --> 00:44:21,158
thousand men.What about it,that's
enough when we are 10 people

456
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:26,321
It is fun, it is called impudence

457
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:30,472
If it does not come,
then you still have not been sahajayogi

458
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:32,567
What is in it, mother said.

459
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:34,742
Then what is going to
happen and happening

460
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:38,504
There are many people who
have benefitted from this

461
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:41,094
They have seen how
much benefit it has made

462
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:42,118
How much did it get

463
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,634
But it should be anxious.

464
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:45,204
Must have fun

465
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:50,238
If the fun does not appear in the person,
then something has happened

466
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:52,696
He did not have seriousness.

467
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:56,791
whisperring in all thing,
paying Attention to small things

468
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:03,299
Do not want to do that, do not want to
do it, or do something that is all fun

469
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,251
Will be deposed,such things
not suitable to sahajayogi

470
00:45:07,402 --> 00:45:08,402
Just fine.

471
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:13,259
If you do all the fun, then you will be surprised,
what kind of work is done? how things happen?

472
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:18,163
You have come into the kingdom of God,
If will not having fun now,then when?

473
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,819
So all this is a happy
day, It's a day of light,

474
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,159
We got a flag of freedom.

475
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:35,135
So I myself in Delhi, saw second flag.
to rising and descending,

476
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:39,404
And I said that, this is the beauty
of the flag, it should remain

477
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:47,281
And by that grace we all should be
fully integrated with our identity

478
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:52,099
Our personality should be
completely integrated only

479
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:55,057
That should be fun,
should be joyful

480
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,024
Everyone should be
involved in the same

481
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:01,555
Now these people came
from outside so much.

482
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,420
I do not have time to talk
to them for two minutes

483
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,801
It does not take time to sit
near them for two minutes

484
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:10,413
They have come from so far, some of them
are such that I have never seen them

485
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:11,691
They are in the mood

486
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:14,029
I did not spend a minute with them

487
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,617
But they do not feel anything.
In our Maharashtra not llike this

488
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:18,569
Mothers did not come to my house.

489
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:20,141
Not come to my premises.

490
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:24,726
have not been to my center,
My, me, mine is very much.

491
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:27,995
And mother did not give time to me,
Give me time.

492
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,266
I have spent all my time in Maharashtra

493
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,674
There is no time to talk to these people

494
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:35,531
I do not even ask
him, how you are?

495
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:36,492
To this date.

496
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:38,781
How are you ?
It is not even said

497
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,099
What do they come here,
and what are they?

498
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,154
means,Thay does not meet.

499
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:46,390
Went to their country,
which means that are a little too much

500
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,382
But they never said that

501
00:46:49,486 --> 00:46:55,087
Mother, come to me or
come to my home. Talk to me.

502
00:46:55,206 --> 00:46:56,206
Never

503
00:46:57,468 --> 00:47:00,984
Well, secondly, if I would go to
someone, then I would go

504
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,111
That's mine

505
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:04,524
I would go wherever I want

506
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:07,047
I do my convenience

507
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:10,134
People will say,
why did you go to their house?

508
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,683
Hey there, I get convenience there,
so I go, who will you say?

509
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,968
So that's me,
that's why you're going there

510
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:19,175
To force me to do so

511
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:25,071
But all this is a sign of eloquence and
stupidity, that they should not be so.

512
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:29,847
So everyone, for two minutes,
come for a minute to me.why?

513
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:31,885
Why come?

514
00:47:31,997 --> 00:47:33,893
What are you going to get?

515
00:47:34,195 --> 00:47:37,869
troubled me and made me unhappy

516
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,846
Then,How do i feel happy?

517
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:45,132
And how will you get blessings from that
happiness? If you followed my troubles

518
00:47:45,553 --> 00:47:48,509
So do not insist that to
come my house.

519
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:51,303
Come to me.this my should gone.

520
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,398
Which is your house All
of my houses are there.

521
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,061
My child,

522
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,688
My house, my husband,
This is all vengeful symptom.

523
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:08,126
It should be kept in mind that whatever
children do my, me, those children should never

524
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,721
Can not match.

525
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,816
you have so much heartache
in it that It's a mistake to

526
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:19,243
say that, even if he is a
murderer, then he is the baby.

527
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:23,131
So we are a sahajayogi
to get away from him

528
00:48:23,182 --> 00:48:27,282
How should your child be described? You will
not know unless you stay away and see it

529
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:28,936
So do not invlove in it .

530
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:32,880
And the society that will be created
by chance, That's the true quality

531
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:38,981
He is a true sahajayogi and he will
be blessed with this great work

532
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,925
May god bless you .

533
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,875
Gulal etc ...

534
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:16,711
Should get some communication back

535
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,163
One i think that people

536
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:21,187
From pune going to mumbai

537
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:25,507
Mumbains,Punein,from
there,from nagar

538
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:29,253
This,This and the lane in
it, do not remove

539
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:35,968
Everyone should meet,Should be in
You must increase love with yourself

540
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:40,201
Everyone has given
such a suggestion that

541
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:42,225
It would be good for man

542
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:45,828
And everyone should travel

543
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:48,378
You must meet here and there

544
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:50,608
Which today

545
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,949
Sahajayoga

546
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:55,404
It has spread to foreign countries.
Sahajayogi there due to it,Not mi

547
00:49:57,118 --> 00:50:00,065
Because I do not have so much
time, my home is there

548
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:07,105
My husband ia there,So much so Month out of
my tour, Soon there are 14 countries to go

549
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,792
So I live in a country
for 2 to 3 days

550
00:50:10,514 --> 00:50:14,177
But these people came here to
themselves, go there from there

551
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:17,922
Go and talk to them Make
arrangements everywhere

552
00:50:17,962 --> 00:50:20,216
It does not matter that there are
four psyche sitting at one place

553
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:27,867
People of Pune go to four places It is
necessary to go out and talk to people only

554
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:30,859
But you sit in one place
There is a big problem

555
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,083
So it should be taken into mind
That should come among themselves

556
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:40,904
And when you get in touch,
It should be done as well for sahajayogi

557
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:42,448
Only then will it work

558
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:48,123
But that does not mean many people,
Let's know some of that and try to mess it

559
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:51,930
Mother said,Then they
go with their bed

560
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:56,224
And whose house a month has
stopped He came to and crying

561
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:02,589
Hey Mataji stayed for a month,Now
what to do? then you said it only.

562
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,297
Self-respect i said

563
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:10,368
There is no need to stay with anyone
Do it yourself and arrange somewhere

564
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,684
You have two days to go and
meet and ask how you are?

565
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:16,857
What's not?, what to do with the
program, and what to do

566
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:19,769
Now move on
