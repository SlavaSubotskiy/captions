1
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:28,012
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:37,012
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

3
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:42,351
His power comes from his innocence.

4
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:47,153
When we see small children we are automatically

5
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,772
compelled towards them

6
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:58,292
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

7
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:03,212
And very innocent they are,

8
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,812
extremely innocent,

9
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:13,332
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

10
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:20,292
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

11
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:27,172
These days people have become extremely cunning,

12
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:30,972
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

13
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,532
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

14
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:38,572
who are innocent and simple.

15
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:41,972
They can justify themselves always

16
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:47,052
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

17
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,332
when everybody is so cunning.

18
00:05:50,492 --> 00:06:00,572
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

19
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,892
which is very much punishable,

20
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:09,732
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

21
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:13,732
which are physical, you can say.

22
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:22,052
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

23
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:26,252
Also, they can have other troubles

24
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,932
with their liver treatments and all that.

25
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:35,972
All this comes up. Then to punish them

26
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:41,652
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

27
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,052
At this time, when you have these problems,

28
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:48,452
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

29
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,492
should worship Shri Ganesha.

30
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:59,052
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

31
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:04,532
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

32
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:08,732
extra work, I should say, than normal.

33
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:13,452
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

34
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:17,892
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

35
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:25,372
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

36
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,172
One of the two things come up

37
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:32,492
and he does not know where he is going.

38
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:38,692
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

39
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:43,332
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

40
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:50,692
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

41
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:54,049
All these diseases of the right side

42
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,612
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

43
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:04,572
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

44
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:12,012
but there is a simple way to remember him

45
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:17,572
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

46
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:21,492
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

47
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:26,412
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

48
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,252
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

49
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:35,132
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

50
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:39,972
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

51
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:44,932
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

52
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,612
and all the worries from you.

53
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:51,692
So this is the most important deity we have.

54
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:55,052
Though its a very simple deity.

55
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:58,732
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

56
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:02,092
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

57
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:10,772
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

58
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:17,772
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

59
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,652
So to steady down these

60
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:27,852
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

61
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:35,052
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

62
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:40,012
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

63
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:44,172
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

64
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:48,492
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

65
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:53,892
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

66
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,012
he never said who it was.

67
00:09:56,172 --> 00:10:00,972
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

68
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:07,572
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

69
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,452
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

70
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:13,292
he used to go all out to fight it.

71
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,412
Same is Shri Ganesha.

72
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:20,492
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

73
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:25,532
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

74
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,852
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

75
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:33,692
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

76
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:38,132
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

77
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:42,892
in different troubles and hurdles and also

78
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:46,532
different type of very very difficult times.

79
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:51,132
It is his style that he manages things so well

80
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,972
because he is a Ganapati.

81
00:10:54,132 --> 00:11:00,092
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

82
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:04,852
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

83
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:13,012
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

84
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,092
who report if there is any problem.

85
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:21,372
They report to the brain that there is a problem

86
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:28,172
and on the sternum bone is the residence

87
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:33,972
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

88
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:42,972
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

89
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:46,692
sternum bone starts vibrating

90
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:53,332
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

91
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:57,492
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

92
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:02,612
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

93
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,732
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

94
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,852
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

95
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,652
are helped by Ganas is not true.

96
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:17,132
Also the people who are mentally upset,

97
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:22,012
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

98
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:27,292
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

99
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:32,372
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

100
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:39,012
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

101
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:43,812
Now his parents start crying for Mother

102
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,932
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

103
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:51,692
that they immediately rush to that place

104
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:56,332
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

105
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,092
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

106
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:06,892
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

107
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,652
They are also small like him

108
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:14,412
and they are very active and very alert.

109
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,532
They never sleep.

110
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:20,732
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

111
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:25,732
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

112
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:32,052
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

113
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,452
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

114
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:40,772
For example there was a boy who got drowned

115
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:47,172
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

116
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,252
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

117
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,972
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

118
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,292
because there were children.

119
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:57,012
So one boy fell down into that

120
00:13:57,172 --> 00:14:00,372
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

121
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,492
Nobody knew he was there.

122
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:08,172
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

123
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:11,892
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

124
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:16,852
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

125
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:20,532
After that they got so frightened

126
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,292
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

127
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,972
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

128
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,402
I didn’t know even the address.

129
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:33,972
But I asked to telephone to this number,

130
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:37,052
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

131
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:42,812
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

132
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:46,052
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

133
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,772
and he will be saved.

134
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,932
Nobody had told me anything.

135
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,692
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

136
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:57,532
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

137
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:01,572
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

138
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:04,252
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

139
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,292
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

140
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,892
If there is one chance of his surviving,

141
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:14,972
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

142
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:18,092
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

143
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,172
So, like this, so many things happen

144
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:26,292
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

145
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:29,892
your blessings that this has happened.

146
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,892
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

147
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,492
but because of Shri Ganesha.

148
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:38,132
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

149
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,652
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

150
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:47,652
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

151
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:51,252
To him his Mother is everything.

152
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:54,412
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

153
00:15:54,572 --> 00:16:00,092
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

154
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:07,612
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

155
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:12,372
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

156
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:17,932
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

157
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:21,252
but His work is tremendous.

158
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:26,132
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

159
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:32,052
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

160
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:35,892
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

161
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:42,172
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

162
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:46,852
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

163
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:49,452
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

164
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:52,612
Its not only in women but also in men,

165
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,932
he expects chastity to be present.

166
00:16:56,092 --> 00:17:01,292
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

167
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,692
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

168
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:10,772
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

169
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:15,092
of communicating with young women and young men

170
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:18,012
and spoiling your chastity.

171
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,012
Even your eyes should be clean,

172
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,692
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

173
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:27,772
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

174
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:30,372
what mistakes you have committed

175
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:37,372
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

176
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:42,812
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

177
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:46,332
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

178
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:50,732
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

179
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,532
but that is a very important thing.

180
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:58,852
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

181
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,572
We should be very chaste.

182
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:04,772
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

183
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:08,572
But religions have become so useless now,

184
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:12,012
have become without any basis,

185
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:22,692
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

186
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,252
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

187
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:30,612
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

188
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,812
Actually the religions have failed completely

189
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:38,812
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

190
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,092
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

191
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:44,452
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

192
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:48,132
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

193
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:54,972
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

194
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:59,932
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

195
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:06,692
and where people are also having very bad morals.

196
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:11,492
He creates problems for them. What happens that

197
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:18,532
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

198
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,076
Earthquake takes place in places where

199
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,892
there is no respect of chastity,

200
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,892
also where there are fundamentalist

201
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:35,892
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

202
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:40,812
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

203
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,252
So the Mother earth also understands.

204
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,852
Now we have so many earthquakes,

205
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,292
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

206
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,452
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

207
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,372
So he protects them.

208
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:59,252
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

209
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,452
he tries to destroy them,

210
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:05,572
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

211
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:16,492
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

212
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,372
he attracts people towards himself,

213
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:24,372
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

214
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:29,172
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

215
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:34,852
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

216
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:38,052
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

217
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:41,772
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

218
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:46,532
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

219
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:50,252
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

220
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:56,932
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

221
00:20:57,092 --> 00:21:01,852
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

222
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:06,412
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

223
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,732
they go back to their own place.

224
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,092
So going back to the same place is only possible

225
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:15,092
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

226
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:19,532
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

227
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,652
also they are bound by their own qualities.

228
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:28,692
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

229
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,092
and a lion will be a lion.

230
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:34,852
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

231
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:37,132
So they could be anything, you can’t say

232
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:41,172
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

233
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,932
And once they become anything like that

234
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:48,692
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

235
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:51,252
when they are human beings.

236
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:56,012
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

237
00:21:56,172 --> 00:22:01,092
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

238
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:05,572
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

239
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:10,572
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

240
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:13,652
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

241
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:18,252
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

242
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:26,092
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

243
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,292
Before the statue they dance

244
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:34,852
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

245
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:40,532
music from some very funny films or something.

246
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,652
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

247
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,932
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

248
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:52,292
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

249
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,732
and they were dancing before it.

250
00:22:54,892 --> 00:23:00,492
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

251
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:04,932
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

252
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,452
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

253
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:13,092
At that time the earth moved

254
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:22,852
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

255
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:25,332
They all disappeared into earth.

256
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:28,652
Apart from that there were many others also

257
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:33,052
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

258
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,892
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

259
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:44,652
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

260
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:50,732
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

261
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:56,012
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

262
00:23:56,172 --> 00:24:05,292
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

263
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:10,412
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

264
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:12,892
They were all right.

265
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:18,012
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

266
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:20,688
and this is how they saved the Ashram

267
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:23,652
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

268
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:28,052
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

269
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:31,972
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

270
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:34,612
So we must respect his Ganas,

271
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:39,372
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

272
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:41,572
they are acting within us.

273
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:44,892
They see us what sort of person you are,

274
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:49,812
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

275
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,975
by your misbehavior

276
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:56,412
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

277
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,572
They give you a chance many a times.

278
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:06,212
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

279
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:12,932
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

280
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:17,012
I should say, calamity for you people.

281
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:19,772
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

282
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:23,172
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

283
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:28,732
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

284
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:31,932
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

285
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:34,612
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

286
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:41,172
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

287
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:46,132
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

288
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,012
so we are not at all helped by this.

289
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,892
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

290
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:55,812
don’t do any worship of any idol

291
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,692
because these idols have been created by human beings

292
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:04,492
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

293
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:06,972
They are not created by the mother earth

294
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,891
but are copied by people

295
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:13,532
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

296
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:17,332
So that’s, how any idol you get,

297
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:23,612
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

298
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:26,972
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

299
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,812
So whatever is not there,

300
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:34,012
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

301
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,612
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

302
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:41,732
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

303
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,132
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

304
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:48,172
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

305
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:52,972
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

306
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:57,012
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

307
00:26:57,172 --> 00:27:03,492
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

308
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:08,892
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

309
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:13,172
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

310
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:17,852
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

311
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:22,772
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

312
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,972
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

313
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:29,172
and how he is doing this to us.”

314
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:35,692
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

315
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:41,932
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

316
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,452
And then he realized it.

317
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:46,292
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

318
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:51,732
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

319
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:56,172
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

320
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:58,852
and being very cunning and clever.

321
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:03,572
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

322
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:11,012
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

323
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:16,532
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

324
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:21,772
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

325
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:25,052
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

326
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,972
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

327
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:34,372
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

328
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:37,612
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

329
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:43,292
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

330
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:50,332
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

331
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:58,732
that he can move mountains after mountains.

332
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:05,292
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

333
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:12,612
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

334
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,892
can be changed.

335
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:21,612
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

336
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:23,852
of the right direction.

337
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:29,892
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

338
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:34,452
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

339
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:37,972
it was the right type and he was successful.

340
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:41,132
But then what happened, they had stencils

341
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,892
and they started using it from the other side.

342
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:47,172
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

343
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,452
and then they were all destroyed.

344
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:54,572
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

345
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:56,820
Also we have proved now

346
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,932
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

347
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,652
is actually from the Carbon atom.

348
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:07,372
The carbon atom has got Swastika

349
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:14,332
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

350
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:16,372
all put in series.

351
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:21,692
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

352
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,412
look at it from the left side to right side,

353
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:28,412
what you see is Omkar.

354
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:31,212
If you see it from right side to left side,

355
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,972
you see the Swastika,

356
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:39,852
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

357
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:45,212
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

358
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:50,052
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

359
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:53,652
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

360
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:57,732
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

361
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:01,052
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

362
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:05,812
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

363
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:10,012
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

364
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,772
because we are confused.

365
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,052
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

366
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,092
that this is already written there.

367
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:21,692
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

368
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:29,092
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

369
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:35,372
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

370
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:38,372
All the things I have told you about Christ,

371
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:44,852
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

372
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:48,012
Like Christ had these two fingers,

373
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,492
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

374
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:57,132
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

375
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:01,012
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

376
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:04,692
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

377
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:07,452
only these two fingers why did he use.

378
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:10,277
Pointing out towards his father

379
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:14,352
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

380
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,932
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

381
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:21,412
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

382
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:28,252
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

383
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:33,812
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

384
00:32:33,972 --> 00:32:37,972
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

385
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:39,908
So it all opens out

386
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:45,484
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

387
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:49,612
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

388
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:54,892
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

389
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:59,052
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

390
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:01,012
You are no more cunning.

391
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:07,732
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

392
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:12,972
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

393
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:18,132
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

394
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:25,092
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

395
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:29,972
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

396
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:34,332
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

397
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:37,532
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

398
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:43,743
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

399
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:47,663
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

400
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:51,252
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

401
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:53,412
We don’t look after the mother earth.

402
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:56,892
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

403
00:33:57,052 --> 00:34:01,012
Actually in Indian culture it is that

404
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,172
when you are getting up in the morning,

405
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:09,252
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

406
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:13,692
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

407
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:16,932
because I am touching you with my feet.

408
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,412
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

409
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,292
then you won’t exploit it,

410
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:25,052
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

411
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:28,052
It all comes out of our ignorance

412
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:32,612
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

413
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:36,452
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

414
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:41,092
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

415
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:44,172
what is to be done.

416
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,252
The mother earth itself we should look after,

417
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:51,012
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

418
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,412
we can do all kinds of things

419
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:59,092
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

420
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:03,932
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

421
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:07,172
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

422
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:11,892
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

423
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:13,932
is a very wrong thing.

424
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:17,692
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

425
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,852
you should put another one there.

426
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:23,372
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

427
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:27,972
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

428
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:35,572
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

429
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:38,932
I don’t know how they live but they do

430
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:45,092
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

431
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:49,132
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

432
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:55,172
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

433
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:58,332
that it should get the sunrays.

434
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,052
There is no quarrel about it.

435
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:03,852
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

436
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:09,132
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

437
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,492
The animals also don’t destroy,

438
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:14,692
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

439
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:18,532
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

440
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:21,172
do not destroy anything

441
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:27,212
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

442
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:30,492
Whatever may be the cry for this,

443
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:34,412
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

444
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,412
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

445
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:41,532
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

446
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:46,532
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

447
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:49,092
He is the greatest yogi we have

448
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:52,692
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

449
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:58,972
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

450
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:07,492
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

451
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:10,372
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

452
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,492
and we should really worship him.

453
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:15,302
Through him all deities are worshiped

454
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:22,692
and are made happy and blissful.

455
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:28,332
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

456
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:33,612
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

457
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:44,892
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

458
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:49,532
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

459
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:52,692
but you are dishonoring yourself

460
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:56,292
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

461
00:37:56,452 --> 00:38:02,132
by becoming so sinful.

462
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:05,772
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

463
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:12,172
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

464
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,812
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

465
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:19,492
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

466
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:23,572
Decency is very important in understanding,

467
00:38:23,732 --> 00:38:29,732
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

468
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:36,252
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

469
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:40,492
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

470
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,412
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

471
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,810
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

472
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,645
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

473
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:58,581
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

474
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:03,132
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

475
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:08,035
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

476
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,423
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

477
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,045
because men can develop so many diseases

478
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:16,853
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

479
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:24,749
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

480
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,108
because he is all the time repairing our body.

481
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:31,953
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

482
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:37,964
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

483
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:40,877
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

484
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:43,412
he is protecting our Kundalini.

485
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:50,151
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

486
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:55,909
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

487
00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:00,353
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

488
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,532
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

489
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:11,553
which is also a basis of your self realization.

490
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:15,151
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

491
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,088
and you should find out about yourself,

492
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:22,867
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

493
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:25,412
If we are; what are we doing about it?

494
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:31,753
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

495
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:34,675
You will not like them, will not like such people.

496
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,957
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

497
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:41,031
The children are the best as we know.

498
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:48,618
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

499
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:52,993
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

500
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:56,488
He is the one who is really innocent

501
00:40:56,648 --> 00:41:00,896
but extremely, protective of you,

502
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:04,530
very much protective, with his innocence.

503
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,266
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

504
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:11,172
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

505
00:41:11,332 --> 00:41:14,016
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

506
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:17,466
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

507
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:22,687
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

508
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,012
people are talking about it that

509
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:29,236
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

510
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:32,591
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

511
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:39,532
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

512
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:44,250
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

513
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,060
In America, I was surprised to see that

514
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,972
there were so many Red Indians,

515
00:41:51,132 --> 00:41:54,972
who are called as Indian Americans.

516
00:41:55,132 --> 00:42:00,259
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

517
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:04,570
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

518
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,372
I found the vibrations were so good.

519
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:10,172
That means they were very innocent, simple people

520
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:13,351
and Americans that time, who went there,

521
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:16,372
tried to completely finish them.

522
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:19,861
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

523
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:23,612
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

524
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,622
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

525
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:30,492
still the people who live there or worked about

526
00:42:30,652 --> 00:42:35,793
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

527
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:40,526
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

528
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,861
But they are so simple and innocent

529
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,972
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

530
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:48,772
because they used to worship the Mother.

531
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:51,572
All the time they worship the Mother.

532
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:55,332
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

533
00:42:55,492 --> 00:43:00,592
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

534
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,552
They have many Maoris and all those people

535
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:05,432
and they encourage all of them

536
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:09,432
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

537
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:16,675
and they are bringing them to this state to show

538
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:21,548
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

539
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,912
Its a very good venture.

540
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:30,792
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

541
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:35,611
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

542
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:40,690
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

543
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,952
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

544
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:46,352
from the mother earth.

545
00:43:46,512 --> 00:43:50,272
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

546
00:43:50,432 --> 00:43:57,592
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

547
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,388
That’s what it is.

548
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:04,228
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

549
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:07,952
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

550
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,453
and Government also has never troubled us

551
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:13,068
or there has been no problem with them.

552
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:15,773
I don’t know what’s this helping them

553
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:20,293
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

554
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:24,742
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

555
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:28,793
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

556
00:44:28,953 --> 00:44:31,043
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

557
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:35,447
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

558
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:37,731
You will be helped, miraculously

559
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:43,102
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

560
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,125
May God Bless You.
