1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,520
Please be seated.

2
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,200
Madras is known for perfect rituals about puja

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,960
and that is how

4
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,960
in the growth of our awareness

5
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,080
even towards God and towards the rituals

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,400
we have moved from reality.

7
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,960
As they say the tree of awareness grows downwards

8
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:49,960
so in the West

9
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,960
it grew towards materialism,

10
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,200
grew towards

11
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,311
something that was filthy

12
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,819
went down and down.

13
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,440
But as Shri Krishna has said the roots are in your head

14
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:10,455
But in the Hindu religion

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,639
it didn't go that bad.

16
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,537
In other religions it did

17
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,960
but not in Hindu religion that bad.

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
What happened in the Hindu religion that it went

19
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:26,807
to the left or to the right.

20
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,960
So when it went to the right

21
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,465
it went towards

22
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:37,960
the elements of worshipping of elements.

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,565
That's how they started Vedas.

24
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:48,377
Vedas are like Stuties and Smrities are made

25
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,960
to master the elements,

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
to master the elements.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
How do you master the elements?

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
You can ask the breeze to blow in

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
now you need some breeze, all right have it.

30
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
you can do the

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,520
Sun miracles of every kind.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
You can get the rain if you want

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
all these things could have been done

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,080
through the Vedas.

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,840
But the first and forth thing fore

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,320
foremost thing in the Vedas, is that

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
it should be Vida, Vida is the word,

38
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,480
Vida is the main word.

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,040
Now vida means bodha

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,040
Bodh means the experience

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,880
of the central nervous system.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
It doesn't mean that I give you a big lecture

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,280
or you read some books,

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
you read Vedas by heart, no.

45
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
It was meaning that you first become the vidas.

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,480
vidvanaas, vid, vid means, the bodhas

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,480
That means the awareness must achieve it's fourth dimension

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,800
and should, you should become

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,760
a  person with that fourth dimension,

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,480
achieving the sensation

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
of the All-Pervading  power

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,200
on your central nervous system.

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,240
This was what Vedas were.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
But when you have achieved it and then you read the Vedas

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,960
then you can have power on all the elements.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,800
So then now, if you read stuties and smrities, it has a meaning.

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,240
But to achieve that state first of all, is important.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
That's why in sahaja yoga we don't deal with Vedas just now.

59
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,280
We have to achieve that state,

60
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,680
when by reading those Vedas or by saying those mantras

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,960
we can achieve that state in which automatically,

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:19,160
spontaneously you can have power on all the elements.

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,160
But not with desires, it just works out spontaneously,

64
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,800
is a state, is a state of a personality.

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,960
So, this is how it started.

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, even in the Vedas

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,720
they wanted to go to the essence of everything.

68
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,560
It was not nirakara they talked of

69
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,160
but the essence of every chakras.

70
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,760
To say that they just talked of nirakara

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,440
is the way, you don't understand at all Veda.

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,520
They didn't talk of the formless

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,840
they talked of the all pervading Power, which is formless.

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,760
They talked about that part which is the essence of chakras

75
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,040
but they didn't want to talk about the Deities.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Because when you talk about the Deities

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
then people get stuck with it.

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,320
Like as I always say that when you talk about the flowers

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,960
people get stuck to it and they don't seek the

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,880
nectar, they don't seek the honey.

81
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
Now, the second part is, if you talk about the honey

82
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,640
also you just talk about the honey.

83
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
It's talk and talk.

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,680
So you have to become a madhukar, you have to become the bee,

85
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,760
to get to that honey.

86
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,480
That's the main point.

87
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,560
Unless and until you become the bee you cannot get to the honey

88
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,360
whether you talk about honey or about flowers.

89
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,280
So Vedas also became another talk

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,840
and after that the horrible thing happened was the Arya Samaj.

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,280
That's the worst of all.

92
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,040
I mean if you meet any Arya Samaji you feel like jumping in the sea,

93
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,120
I mean to get rid of him, it's horrible.

94
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,240
He talks, talks, talks,talks through his hat,

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,200
he doesn't know what he's talking and what he is meaning.

96
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,960
So this Arya Samaj business came out of the same Veda

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,760
which is a one side, the right side.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,760
So we got stuck on to the right side;

99
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,040
the awareness, the tree of awareness got stuck,

100
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,920
the leaves caught on to the right side.

101
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,754
Like in the West they have got it in the grounds ,

102
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,960
absolutely into the filth.

103
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,840
the dirt of Mooladhara, beyond Mooladhara.

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,326
But we too have lost ourselves

105
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,323
on to the right side

106
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,960
and doing all supra conscious nonsense at the time of

107
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,960
Changdev

108
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:13,690
that was when Shri Gyaneshwara was there.

109
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,960
he was a supra conscious mind person

110
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
and he tried to show some supra conscious miracles.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,752
to Shri Gyaneshwara.

112
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:33,306
Gyaneshwara and his brothers and sisters were sitting on a wall

113
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,413
and suddenly the whole wall lifted up

114
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,768
and took them from one place to another

115
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:42,415
and this fellow was surprised

116
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,415
how on material things how they are working out.

117
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,549
because they became first of all

118
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,280
realized souls of a very high level.

119
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,804
Gyaneshwara was an incarnation

120
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,960
and then they had also their mastery

121
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,360
over all the five elements.

122
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,657
But that is first you go urdhwagami

123
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:08,000
first you achieve your realization,

124
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,960
you achieve your state of your realization

125
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,400
and then you come down

126
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,457
in a way that you go to the right

127
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:19,960
and you can go to the left.

128
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,604
But first your doings must be built.

129
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
This was the state.

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
That's how in our Hindu religion

131
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,960
we got stuck upon the right side

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,960
say mantras, stuties and you are not realized soul,

133
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,120
you are not even vidas.

134
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Without realization it's like a charpat panjari,

135
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:41,960
as they call it, it's just talking,talking, talking, talking.

136
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,920
so that is no use.

137
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,960
The second thing was, we got stuck on the left

138
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,920
in the sense, where they talked of the Deities

139
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,400
we started worshipping Deities,

140
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,960
who would worship the Deities.

141
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,741
you have no right to worship,

142
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,397
you have no passage to them,

143
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,123
you have no connection with them.

144
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:06,920
How are you worshipping them?

145
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,236
In the air somewhere, they're worshipping,

146
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,175
like going to Vitthal mandir

147
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,400
in Maharashtra.

148
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,392
You see it was alright

149
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,374
for Tukarama to worship

150
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,243
because they were all realized souls.

151
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,960
But these stupid people nowadays,

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,960
from the villages, they take some Tabacco in the mouth

153
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:34,345
and go on worshipping God

154
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,960
in the sense that they go on saying alright

155
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,480
Vitthal, Vitthal, Vitthal,  all like mad going

156
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,960
till they break their necks and

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,960
when they go there also these,the priests there

158
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,360
break their heads actually, just like coconuts.

159
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,892
And I have met many who have lost their heads completely.

160
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
they said we got it through Vitthal.Imagine.

161
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,224
Vitthala gave this, Imagine!

162
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,841
This is the situation.

163
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:06,280
So we have to realize that we also in our seeking,

164
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,434
we got stuck on to the left hand side.

165
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,960
But much worse in Madras I've seen a horrid scenes

166
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
like I saw

167
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,960
ladies going round the temple

168
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,960
somebody pouring water

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,286
was so shocked

170
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,880
at the cruelty of this kind of a thing. I sat down

171
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,718
was wondering, who told them this nonsense?

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,456
God knows?

173
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:34,960
Then the ritualism was taken over,

174
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,769
which was not real rituals because

175
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
you have not connected by the Brahmins

176
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,429
all over India.

177
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,920
Now the Brahmins are the ones, who have known the Brahma.

178
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,261
You are Brahmins because you know the Brahma.

179
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
But Brahmins were not

180
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,347
to be considered as Brahmins

181
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:58,175
because they are born in a Brahmin family.

182
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,960
It was not according to your birth

183
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:03,960
but according to your karmas,  is a fact

184
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll give you an example.

185
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,456
Like, once there was a problem,

186
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,563
Shankaracharya, so called,

187
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,266
raised a Parliament question, you see,

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,960
that

189
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
it is written in the Gita that

190
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:29,460
you get your birth

191
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,397
prenatal natal or post-natal stuff.

192
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,406
In the post-natal condition

193
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,880
whatever you are born that is your caste.

194
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:39,960
and so, the Brahmins

195
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,830
are the only ones allowed in the temples

196
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,597
and so as we are born Brahmins we are the ones

197
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:46,960
allowed in the temples.

198
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,839
So that time a person came to ask Me,

199
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
how to answer this.

200
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,538
I said,"very simple".

201
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,240
You ask them who wrote Gita?

202
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,542
Vyasa. Who was Vyasa?

203
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,960
Illegitimate child of a  fisher woman.

204
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:13,648
Now, how can he say such a thing?

205
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,922
Because he was a Brahmin.

206
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,960
It's true, only the Brahmins must be allowed in the temple.

207
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,464
But who are the Brahmins is the basic problem.

208
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,843
If you are born as a Brahmin, you are not a Brahmin according to

209
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,960
Hindu religion. Should not be.

210
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,857
You have to know the Brahma.

211
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,528
What about Valmiki?

212
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,325
He was another fisherman,

213
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:37,960
who became a daaku.

214
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,126
He was a dacoit

215
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,630
and this dacoit was really a horrible man.

216
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:48,892
But was corrected by Narada, as you know the whole story.

217
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,127
So, he is the Valmiki.

218
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,480
Now, how does Valmiki becomes a Brahmin?

219
00:13:58,315 --> 00:13:59,643
So, how is he

220
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,960
the one who wrote Ramayana, who was a dacoit

221
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,698
and born of such a low caste.

222
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,960
But they will not allow Vaidas

223
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,173
and Kabir Das to enter the temples,

224
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,515
but these horrible, so called brahmins

225
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:25,120
are sitting there eating the money,that is given to God.

226
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,880
So it is necessary for Indian sahaja yogies

227
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,960
to understand how we have failed

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,080
we must know our defects,

229
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:37,747
why we have failed in our pursuit of God?

230
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,218
Why there are so many temples?

231
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,588
See, many people ask Me

232
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:45,104
Mother, You say, it's a yoga bhumi,

233
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,920
it is this that then, why are you so poor?

234
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,960
Why such a problem in your country?

235
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,081
The reason is  we're not yogis

236
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,300
Yogakshema vahamamyam

237
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,960
if you get the yoga, then He gives you kshema.

238
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,960
First you get the yoga then the kshema,

239
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,760
without the yoga, there is no kshema.

240
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:10,880
And without the yoga, you are not the Brahmin.

241
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,960
That's as  simple as that.

242
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,681
Even to interpret Shri Krishna

243
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,960
you have to be a realized soul.

244
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,453
See what He says, three things He has said,

245
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,579
Bhakti yoga He says,

246
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,783
"Patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam"

247
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,293
all these things, I

248
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,519
give to you.

249
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:36,960
I take from you, I receive.

250
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,175
When it comes to giving,

251
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,960
He says, the word ananya bhakti,

252
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,486
ananya; means when there not the other.

253
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,255
When this happens, He is the diplomat.

254
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,898
I want to tell you frankly on your face.

255
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,960
Ananya means when you are a yogi,

256
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,628
when there is not the other.

257
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,960
Then He comes to second point.

258
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,561
Gyana He said the first thing.Gyana means bodh

259
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:07,678
bodh marg that is sahaja yoga.

260
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,960
Then about karma, right side

261
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,920
what does He say?

262
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,857
You do all your work and put it at My lotus feet.

263
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,880
"Karmanye va dhi karastey phaleshu ma kadachin."

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,070
Impossible situation.

265
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,640
See this is diplomacy

266
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,960
Put absurd conditions, which look sensible,

267
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:27,960
but are absurd,

268
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,836
so you go on rubbing with that.

269
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,930
There are many who tell Me,Mother,

270
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,474
we do, all our jobs and put at the Lotus Feet of God.

271
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,960
I said, "Really, how do you know that?"

272
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:41,357
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

273
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,055
you feel you are doing it

274
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,960
but once you're realized soul

275
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,720
you said, 'It's going, it's coming,

276
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,240
it's happening, not happening,

277
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
see the point.

278
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,942
Now, because of this

279
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,960
what happens that

280
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,635
people get into a bhrama,

281
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,111
into an illusion

282
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,080
that we are doing all God's work

283
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:11,960
and putting at His feet, you are not.

284
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:13,960
You are not a realized soul

285
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,415
you have to become a third person

286
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,960
you have to say, I am giving it.

287
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,385
No, it's going, it's coming

288
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,240
I goes away.

289
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:26,559
Doesn't work out, it works out.

290
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,502
You never say, 'Mother,

291
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:29,960
I can't work out sahaja yoga.

292
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:31,299
I've not heard anybody saying that.

293
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,689
They say, Mother,  doesn't work out,

294
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,584
it works out,  it's working.'

295
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:37,475
We start just talking about it all the time,

296
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,230
as soon as we become a realized soul.

297
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:45,371
There was a lady, who came with Me to America

298
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,333
and she said, Mother, please give realization to my son.

299
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,685
He's come all the way from Honolulu, this that.

300
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,537
I said, "You give him."

301
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,122
I can't.

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,740
I said then, "How can I?"

303
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,412
Then you give him a certificate, he is a realized soul.

304
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:02,119
How can I, it's false? I said that's what it is.

305
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,077
It has to happen.

306
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:06,960
You cannot give a false certificate

307
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,032
that you are a realized soul, it has to happen.

308
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,540
And that is what sahaja yoga is

309
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,080
absolutely a shuddh vidya (pure knowledge)

310
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
and a shuddh thing

311
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:21,840
that in that you have to get realization

312
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,960
and establish yourself.

313
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,960
So by going to the left-side

314
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,849
we got stuck up into the

315
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:32,185
collective subconscious.This side the collective supra conscious

316
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:35,240
that side the collective subconscious.

317
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,960
The people who are now in the West have

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,530
discovered all about the matter and all that

319
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,531
has come out of this kind of a venture on the right hand side

320
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,742
because God wanted them to know that know the matter

321
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,674
that's all, for their convenience, for their comfort,

322
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,960
for giving them more time,

323
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
so that they come to God.

324
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,741
But Science moved in a one linear way

325
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:04,194
and has produced atom bombs and everything like rakshasas

326
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:06,922
and now they are waiting for the rakshasas

327
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,750
to drop down upon themselves.

328
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,283
On the left-hand side

329
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,056
now we, now, this is India

330
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:14,713
left hand side is India.

331
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:18,491
We got stuck, we are stucky people.

332
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,920
You see, they lost their roots,

333
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,800
you can be fool them like anything in

334
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,482
as far as religion is concerned.

335
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:28,080
They have no roots at all also

336
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:32,880
because they have gone down so much

337
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,960
or there, their roots are lost, they have no roots.

338
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,364
They're dangling, you can put them into left or right

339
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,960
You know, witchcraft is so much common in America.

340
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,175
You can put them into witchcraft,

341
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,395
you can put it into any craft you want to

342
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:47,870
you can manage them.

343
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,468
or they can go to the right side, they can go to the left side

344
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,960
you can create Hitlers out of them,

345
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:53,771
you can created anything what you want

346
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,960
because they have become just like bananas,

347
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,051
they have no roots.

348
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,960
So one side, we got stuck with this

349
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,792
too much argumentation, too much of discussion,

350
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:09,443
too much of what you call Philosophy

351
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:13,396
this that, the intellectuals, so called, vidvanas

352
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:17,080
in the Hindu Philosophy, are stupid people.

353
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,558
Because they have not got their realization

354
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:25,353
and even to such an extent, now they are saying that

355
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
Adishankaracharya did not write,

356
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,090
Adishankaracharya did not write the

357
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,629
Saundarya Lahiri.

358
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:38,751
Intellectuals, you know,

359
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:41,960
they are the great grandfathers of Adi Shankaracharya

360
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,960
so they're saying he did not write.

361
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:48,320
Because, how can a Vivek Chudanami, the one he wrote, you see,

362
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:51,492
after that whole thing such a treatise of

363
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:54,063
all Philosophy, how could he write

364
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,960
that you must serve the Mother,

365
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,822
how can that be?

366
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,960
In puja you should sit in right manner.

367
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:06,200
Don't do this, you attention should be towards Me.

368
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,960
Alright, so as a result of that what happened that we

369
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,216
got lost into intellectual understanding of our

370
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:24,960
Philosophy and for that

371
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,960
As Kabir Das has put it

372
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:31,960
"'Padhi, padhi pundit moorakh bhaiye."

373
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:33,960
So they have become stupid fools right side.

374
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:38,404
Left side people got stuck into these rituals

375
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:41,069
so these Brahmins became very powerful

376
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:44,628
so called Brahmins. So much so that in Nasik

377
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,960
the Brahmins sent Me word saying that the

378
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,186
because You have come from abroad

379
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,428
you have to come for your prayaschit to us.

380
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,557
Even Gandhiji had to do the prayashchit.

381
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,854
I said, "One day you will have to do prayashchit."

382
00:21:59,523 --> 00:22:00,960
Such arrogance

383
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,175
and such horrid things they're doing.

384
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:07,082
And Kashi Vishweshwara

385
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,831
they have got Romans, you see, Roman soldiers.

386
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,570
Actually they came to Maharashtra

387
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:16,585
on the Konkan side

388
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:20,006
maybe in Goa or some place, Panaji maybe,

389
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:23,960
and from there they went.

390
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,960
Adi Shankaracharya must have thought

391
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:29,693
that in the beginning they were nice people

392
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,960
He must have given realization one or two person

393
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,314
So he appointed all of them,

394
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,785
these Konkanasthas, They are Konkanash
 (One Cast of Brahmins in India)

395
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:40,151
into all these places

396
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,960
and within two, three generations, two generations,

397
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,744
I think, they came in their true colors as Romans.

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,960
And they're just like cobras, you see, like cobras.

399
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:56,461
And in Kashi Vishweshwara they started using women.

400
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,723
They had a one big slippery board

401
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,179
and the when women went there,

402
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:06,280
they used to fall down with ornaments, on them

403
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,322
Then they would take out all the ornaments,

404
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,960
sell these women as prostitutes.

405
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,160
That's why in Banaras

406
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,160
you have the maximum number of prostitutes.

407
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,370
These Brahmins the way they behaved

408
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:24,430
in certain places like, Ranchordas's temple,

409
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:30,077
all the Nath Dwara

410
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:35,388
that was called as haveli, it was a very big case

411
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,653
and the main man there, the haveli man,

412
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:39,960
the one who, chief priest,

413
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,508
was supposed to used

414
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,631
the brides on the first night.

415
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,080
I know of so many great women, who have been used by him.

416
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,715
All this nonsense started growing in this country like that.

417
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,512
So many things, I mean there is no end to it

418
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,960
even in Vindhya, Vindhiya Vasini, they did it.

419
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,754
Then out of these at the extreme end,

420
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,320
started coming the tantrism

421
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:09,230
and the tantrikas discovered a thing

422
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:12,960
that if you can displease the Goddess in any place

423
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:15,484
then that place becomes a vacuum

424
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:16,883
because She's so much there.

425
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,580
Once She goes away, the vacuum is created,

426
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,816
then use that vacuum for getting all the bhoots there

427
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,472
like Kamakhya Devi.

428
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,272
There are twenty-eight places where the goddess's

429
00:24:27,304 --> 00:24:29,983
body fell down, when you know the Sati,

430
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,960
Sati's body fell,

431
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:34,811
She was carried from Daksha, the father

432
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:38,215
by Shiva it fell down on twenty-eight places

433
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,978
and when it fell down on twenty-eight places

434
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,403
There form a temple, came out of the mother Earth.

435
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,920
One of them is Kamakhya Devi

436
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,070
that is, I think, in Assam or Bihar some border there.

437
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,149
All these temples were used for doing negative things

438
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,529
because they did vyabhichara all that

439
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:00,052
in the presence of the goddess,

440
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:01,960
as a result of the goddess, you see,

441
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,724
the goddess got angry, She went away from there.

442
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:06,895
Because, you know, supposing you put the filth here,

443
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,416
I won't sit here, will I?

444
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:12,047
That's how and then they used that part

445
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:14,192
for mesmerizing and this and that

446
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,286
and that's how the tantrism started.

447
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,060
As a result of this tantrism just after

448
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:22,960
Adi Shankaracharya's death

449
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,562
the tantrikas just came out

450
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,960
just like snakes coming out of the grass.

451
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:31,237
And they spread the tantrism right from Konark

452
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,714
all through on that whole

453
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:36,605
I should say the whole patta of it, the whole

454
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,960
line from there up to Surat, up to down like that

455
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:43,960
the whole of it, they covered.

456
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:46,193
They could not cross into Maharashtra, thank God

457
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:49,267
because Maharashtra is, you have to come up and then go

458
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:51,564
into the plateau so they didn't come.

459
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,167
But the whole thing they covered, above the river Narmada,

460
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:57,261
above the river Tapi

461
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,239
they covered all that area,  Madhya Pradesh,

462
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,512
you see, all the Raja, Maharajas all of them

463
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:03,521
were involved.

464
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,960
And what they did was to play a trick with the Raja, Maharaja

465
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:10,380
Just  because they had Jain, Jain people.

466
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:17,614
as what you call ministers or mantris.

467
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,419
And the mantris said

468
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:21,364
that we want to build temples.

469
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,554
So these Rajas, Maharajas were all under these tantrikas.

470
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:28,247
So the Raja, Maharajas said, all right.

471
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:30,982
if you can put these erotics outside, I am willing to do.

472
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:35,055
So they said but why do you want to put the erotics.

473
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,298
They were very clever people these mantricas.

474
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:38,657
so they said, No.

475
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,960
You can put these things outside

476
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,902
because that is life.

477
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:44,822
we must show the life

478
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:49,007
and they put in very big, sort what you call the very big

479
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:52,249
competition.

480
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,429
They put a very big competition

481
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,081
and then that competition they tried to defeat

482
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,960
say sort of one, one organization working here in

483
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,516
in competition with the another

484
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,960
then there should be a defeat

485
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,368
and one is defeated,

486
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:11,391
that was not given a chance to produce.

487
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,960
So the artist also got involved into it.

488
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:15,957
But still in the,

489
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,543
I should say in the, Madhya Pradesh

490
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,109
now these places, the artists were still dharmic

491
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:24,931
because they made the all these erotic figures

492
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:27,724
with lanky- panky bodies, you see,

493
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:30,344
and very funny looking bodies

494
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:31,697
like sick people.

495
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,385
and the Gods and Goddesses are very thick

496
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,120
so you don't see them, I mean, normally

497
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:37,960
you don't see them where are they hanging.

498
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:41,319
And the same architecture

499
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:44,812
because it was in the thing was brought

500
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,460
in your country, in your side also, in Madras.

501
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,132
And in Madras temples

502
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,730
what they did was to put all these erotic outside

503
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,960
and they called this is fertility cult, fertility cult.

504
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,920
And on your temples if you see these small, small figures

505
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,274
they are all those.

506
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:06,268
So how far this negativity has gone

507
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,774
to spoil say like if you go.

508
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:11,089
to the temple of, say,

509
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,547
Tirupati, Tirupati where sakshat

510
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,133
it is, it is there outside,

511
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,831
of the temples these Brahmins have put all these things

512
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
on the door if you see.

513
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,162
Imagine to be put erotics!

514
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,725
Even in Jaggannath Puri

515
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,735
all over they have put these

516
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,609
and we don't understand.

517
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,960
The Konark temple the whole thing was so horrible

518
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:39,013
because the architect himself was a tantrik.

519
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,768
There's no temple, nothing.

520
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:44,691
What he has done he's made all these horrible things

521
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:47,455
and put them in the shape of a temple, there's no temple.

522
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,158
And he said that on top of this

523
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:51,659
I want to put one very big magnet

524
00:28:51,684 --> 00:28:53,761
so that all the ships will be attracted.

525
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:55,300
So the king agreed to that

526
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,640
and he gave lot of money

527
00:28:57,665 --> 00:28:59,960
and that is how the Konark temple was built.

528
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,695
Now the Nepal temple was built

529
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,648
when the artist would not accept this.

530
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,732
They have seen, see this is made out of

531
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,060
kashtha means out of wood

532
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:13,186
and if the Vishnumaya

533
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:16,452
falls upon it means the lightning

534
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:17,960
then it will be all burnt

535
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,039
so best thing is to keep Her attention out.

536
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:22,935
Why not we make some erotics

537
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,678
so that She doesn't come because She is a virgin.

538
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,694
So, poor artist agreed to it

539
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,126
and they made those.

540
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,960
But when we Indians go to a temple,

541
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,446
we never see this, you see

542
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,015
you must have escaped in your temples

543
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,438
you must not have seen this.

544
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:39,224
But if you see the foreigners then you will know,

545
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,666
where they are, because they have zoom lenses you see.

546
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:45,207
They'll climb over. I've seen in, in Nepal

547
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:48,206
you see they, once I when I went there

548
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:51,172
so Gregoire, I said, "Gregoire where are the erotics sites.

549
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,980
I don't see anything  where are the erotics?"

550
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:56,697
So, they said, "Oh! You can't see the erotics?"

551
00:29:56,722 --> 00:29:59,274
I said, "No." He said, "See those Japanese."

552
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:02,336
The Japanese has had put up, you see, big, big

553
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:03,960
what you call

554
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:09,550
Staircase, which is automatic, Yogi: Ladder

555
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:11,566
Ladders but ladders

556
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:14,245
of a very see the ...

557
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,507
alertness

558
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:18,609
the ladders but not this like escalator

559
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:21,392
see, they were like escalators, huge big things.

560
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:23,657
They brought all these from Japan

561
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,011
and put it up

562
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,449
and took the photograph.

563
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:28,055
You see, they were taking photographs.

564
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,562
Then I saw all the machinery going on What's that?

565
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,438
They said and zoom lenses, you see, big, big lenses.

566
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:34,930
Nonsense.

567
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,755
Big. I mean they brought all the machinery all the way.

568
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,097
This is what happens.

569
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,960
Then we had other religions

570
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,960
which tried to, sort of, neutralize it like Jainism

571
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,407
that went into another nonsense.

572
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,376
Jainism is another nonsense

573
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,905
because, you see, at the time of Shri Krishna, Neminath

574
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:57,792
is the one, who opposed,

575
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:58,971
Neminath opposed,

576
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,192
Shri Krishna for one thing because He said

577
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,960
He believes in hinsa.

578
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:08,135
Because in Gita when they say the

579
00:31:08,255 --> 00:31:10,321
Krishna has taught ahinsa I'm surprised.

580
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,388
He taught hinsa.

581
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,805
You know Karna, when his foot was caught up

582
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,952
in the wheel so  Karna

583
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,960
Arjuna, you see, raised his gandiva on him

584
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:30,408
so,Karna said, "See, you are a veera, I'm a veera."

585
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,960
and how can you kill,

586
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:34,151
a nishastra (without any arms) veera

587
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,390
See! So then Krishna pointed His finger like this,

588
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:38,194
and He said,

589
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:41,960
"When, where was your veerta, where was your bravery

590
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,511
when Draupadi's laaj (chastity) was taken?"

591
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:46,511
He said, "You kill him, now."

592
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,307
Where did He teach ahinsa I don't know?

593
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:52,063
Stupidity to think that He teached ahinsa.

594
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:55,866
He preached that who is so ever is dushta,

595
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:58,335
who is wrong should be killed by God.

596
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:02,407
and by the people who are following God.

597
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,750
Like Arjuna, the very beginning of it is

598
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:05,960
he went into Kaivalya.

599
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,855
He said,"Oh! I don't want to kill anybody,

600
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,920
be there's my guru, there's my brother

601
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
there's my sisters this, that."

602
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:17,392
So Shri Krishna said, "What they are already killed,

603
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:20,344
In the name of dharma you have to kill them."

604
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:24,555
And here these stupid these Jains

605
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:26,960
are looking after the mosquitoes

606
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:29,701
and looking after the bugs.

607
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:32,195
They put some bugs in a hut

608
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,960
that's good for the brahmins of course

609
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,931
and give some money to the brahmins

610
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,360
and the bugs have to take all the blood,

611
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:40,613
eat the blood of the brahmins,

612
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:43,558
and then they give the money to the brahmin.

613
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:45,703
But the worst is you know, now,

614
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,632
in Bombay there's a problem because

615
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:51,821
they take all their filth

616
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:55,212
not in the bathroom or anything but they put it on some hill

617
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,251
because the kitanoos (germs) must come out,

618
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,706
the germs must come out.

619
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:04,265
This is Shwetambaras only

620
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:07,851
but the silliest are the Digambaras

621
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:10,399
You see, they are the worst of it.

622
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:13,625
I mean once what happened that

623
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,323
Shri Mahavira was meditating.

624
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,603
While coming out his cloth got cut,

625
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,200
caught up in one kunja.

626
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,989
When his cloth caught up in the kunja

627
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:31,366
what he did was to

628
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:36,323
cut it out, because he thought how to get out

629
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:37,855
so he cut half of his cloth

630
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:39,960
near a half cloth on his body.

631
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:43,707
But then Shri Krishna went just to take his pareeksha (test)

632
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:46,151
and He said, "Now, see, you are a avdhoota,

633
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
why do you need a cloth upon yourself,

634
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:50,087
I'm a nude person you give Me something?”

635
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,632
So he gave Him that.

636
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,858
Just for a minute because he was a king's son,

637
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,048
he didn't have to do anything and he went back

638
00:33:57,305 --> 00:34:00,099
he hid himself and he went back and he wore his dress.

639
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,960
Now, these people are horrible like this Mahabali and all that

640
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,566
making all the details about it it's horrid,

641
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:10,562
people they're insulting him all the time.

642
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,960
But if you see like William Blake,

643
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:18,237
he  has made pictures of human beings,

644
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,960
not showing any parts other that

645
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:21,858
but in a nude way,

646
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:25,914
when he makes the God or makes anybody Mary or Christ,

647
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
covers them.

648
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,060
Same with Michaelangelo.

649
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:35,070
But I don't understand

650
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,578
these horrible Jains.

651
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:38,960
They want to show Gods, as nude

652
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,334
and fight for that.

653
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,960
The worse is they're fighting, that's the good part

654
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:46,850
so much fighting that.

655
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:50,095
I want to tell you My own experience

656
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,156
but it was horrid one day I'll tell you that

657
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,390
First time when I saw them

658
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:56,297
they were terrible mess.

659
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:57,930
Alright, so now

660
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,766
it has reached such a stage

661
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,831
that there is one Parshavnath's

662
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:05,163
thing was found out somewhere, some old statue,

663
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:07,960
so there was a fight going on in the,

664
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,684
is the place where Indra was given realization.

665
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,561
This place, his chhidra (pierced) was made here

666
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:19,323
that's why we call it chidendra

667
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,960
see this chhidra was being here

668
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,965
but actually he's Shuchendra, he was made Shuchi.

669
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,248
This is at the time

670
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:27,809
of Prahlada

671
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,372
that this Indra,

672
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,428
when the mother was pregnant,

673
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:35,490
she.. he wanted to help her.

674
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,397
So he brought her

675
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,265
to Shandilya muni's place.

676
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,161
Now this Shandilya muni, Shandilya is My family, My gotra

677
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,960
My father's, Shalivahanas,

678
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:46,295
gotra is shandily

679
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,263
and he brought that one in Shandilya's ashram.

680
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:53,091
Now the land we have got in Neera is that ashram

681
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,567
just imagine sahaja

682
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:56,960
that is the land we have got.

683
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:59,842
And then now it has come out in the newspapers

684
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,960
for somebody went and did the research after I purchased the land

685
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:06,696
that this, there was, a

686
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:12,204
meeting between the Neera river and the river

687
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,526
some King came all the way here and built that.

688
00:36:31,678 --> 00:36:33,375
So imagine, the Shalivahanaas knew

689
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,999
the Neera is going to come in them,

690
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,972
I'm called as Neera in My family,

691
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:39,702
and on that Neera river, we have got this land.

692
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,694
And this also with a very mysterious thing

693
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,960
because you see, one man

694
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,695
had given this land to the government

695
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:50,064
see and this land I wanted, I liked it.

696
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:52,228
He said, 'The government won't release it,

697
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,731
how can You have this land?'

698
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:54,960
I said I want to have this land only

699
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:58,134
people didn't understand why I wanted that land, I insisted

700
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,273
Then they said, the government won't release.

701
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:02,070
But suddenly he got a letter one day

702
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,469
saying that government think they've taken a surplus land

703
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:05,254
this land is yours.

704
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,656
So he sold it to us and that's how we got it.

705
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,935
Now Prahlada was born there.

706
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,851
He lived there till five years of age

707
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:14,898
and used to go and play there.

708
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:18,640
Then Shandilya muni told Indra

709
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,545
that you leave this lady here

710
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,175
because out of her will come out Prahlada.

711
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,960
He brings forth the promised Narsimha avtara.

712
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,667
So you just don't worry and you go South.

713
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:31,719
and there he came and he got the Shuchindra here

714
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,974
That's how he got realization.

715
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,920
Now this Prahlada

716
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:39,105
went there you know what happened then

717
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:41,289
but here about

718
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:43,764
Peshwai time they tried to build

719
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,197
a temple of Narsimha

720
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:48,935
and they spent lot of money to fill up the place

721
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,055
and they did it but they could not do much

722
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,684
about the temple it was half done.

723
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:55,280
Then one fellow about three hundred years back

724
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:57,935
decided to collect some money to build the temple

725
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,920
and  he built the temple.

726
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,920
In his dream came Prahlada and he told him

727
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,687
that I have already made

728
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:04,280
the statue of Narsimha

729
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,182
on the river Neera,

730
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:08,239
you go and find it on the bank you'll find.

731
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:10,000
He went there and he saw the statue

732
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,448
made out of ordinary sand

733
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:15,724
for so many years it's there.

734
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,349
He picked it up brought it and it's back there

735
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:21,790
and it is still there full of vibrations, see the vibrations.

736
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,298
We have seen it.

737
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:28,040
And in that temple there is on top of the gopuram

738
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:30,231
you see a little dhara (stream)

739
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,000
of water coming all the time.

740
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:36,910
We have so many still, so many miracles in this country

741
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:40,762
but we should go deep into it to find out.

742
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,623
instead of that like stupid fools we are just

743
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:46,747
running after these so called brahmins.

744
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,583
So the depth and the greatness of

745
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:57,289
what should you say, the Indian seers

746
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:00,960
and the rishis and munis was lost like this by these

747
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:03,657
so called mushroom people.

748
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,313
Now it is for Sahaja Yogies

749
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,880
who have to find out all these things, put them on record

750
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:11,711
and have to boldly tell them

751
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:14,195
that we have had enough of you now

752
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,866
let us take over all the temples.

753
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,840
Only the brahmins can enter

754
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,923
you are the only brahmins I see

755
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,477
Where are the brahmins?

756
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,731
Like once in Puna

757
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,960
they had a program arranged for in a

758
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:33,738
place called Rajwade karyalaya.

759
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:35,863
This Rajwade is a brahmin

760
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,935
and Rajwade was told later on that no no no

761
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
this Mataji is not a brahmin how can you have it here?

762
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:46,549
So these, the boys never told Me anything they said alright if

763
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:49,415
you say so we won't have the program

764
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,415
but we'll have to announce in the newspaper that

765
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,335
because She's not a brahmin that's why you're not allowing Her.

766
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,935
He said, "No, no that you can't do.

767
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,643
He said, "Then what are you to say,what is the reason?"

768
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:01,015
So they got a fright. They said,

769
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,578
"Alright, let us have it."

770
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:05,201
So when I was having it, I don't know why,I said,

771
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:08,255
Those who think you are brahmins come here in front of Me."

772
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,960
Four five of them came, started shaking like this way.

773
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:12,375
I said, "What's the matter?"

774
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,429
They said, "No, we accept You're Shakti, stop it, stop it."

775
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:17,778
I said, "But I'm Shakti nobody is shaking."

776
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:20,402
"No, there are people sitting here, they are also shaking."

777
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,949
I said, "Call them."

778
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:24,227
I said , "Go and ask, who are they?"

779
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,840
They are certified mad from Thane

780
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,187
were sent by the district man.

781
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:33,608
These brahmins got a fright of their life.

782
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,335
I said, "That's what you are,

783
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,722
you have to go to Thane now, that's the only place for you."

784
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:41,962
And our Rajwade was sitting on top there,

785
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:46,491
all sort of caught up

786
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,440
by some sort of an arthritis.

787
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,310
I said, "Rajwade, come down now."

788
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,185
He 'I'm also a brahmin, he says from

789
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,753
I said, "Alright, you come down."

790
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:57,469
Say, "I can't, I can't even walk." I said, "Get up and walk."

791
00:40:57,616 --> 00:41:00,315
He's the one who just got up and walked.

792
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,681
came down, then he was so good.

793
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:04,955
He started going on a cycle.

794
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:06,935
That time he was sixty five.

795
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,811
Everyday he used to go and do work in all the villages, this that

796
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,432
I told him, "Stop it now, you shouldn't over do it also,

797
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,026
it's too much, he won't stop."

798
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:17,935
And then he started catching from people this, that,

799
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,895
he got sick, again I cured him again,

800
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,681
I cured him, so many times it happened.

801
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:23,960
But I think ultimately he lost one foot,

802
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:26,336
one foot he's lost,  little bit.

803
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:29,674
But that's what it is, so he never listened to Me.

804
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,962
What I'm trying to tell you is this

805
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:35,220
this is how our great Hindu

806
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:38,898
or we can say, Hindu word I don't want to use because

807
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,798
it has nothing to do with us.

808
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,149
This word was given to us by Alexander

809
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:45,852
because he crossed the river Sindhu

810
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:47,593
he didn't, couldn't say Sindhu, you see,

811
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:50,087
'sa' he could not say, so he called it Hindu.

812
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,933
Sindhu Hindu, see

813
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:55,942
And then he came down from there

814
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,317
and that's how we become Indians, you see.

815
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,099
So, they don't know how to pronounce many words, you see,

816
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:04,911
so that's how they couldn't call Bombay, Mumbai.

817
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,802
so they use to called it Bombay.

818
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:10,142
See, but Mumbai is a very big word it means primordial Mother.

819
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,869
She's the mother of Mumba

820
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:16,413
and Mumba is the mother Amba, is Mumba.

821
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:18,920
And She's the mother of, who is that?

822
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:22,457
That's the Mahakali that's the Primordial Mother.

823
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,274
They couldn't pronounce that word so they called it Bombay.

824
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:29,149
That's how we've got Bombay and all those

825
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,457
all words were ruined by them. All right!

826
00:42:31,764 --> 00:42:33,324
So this is the situation is.

827
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,656
Now today's first thing we have to know

828
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:38,173
that we are facing a very

829
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:40,600
great crowds of mudhas,

830
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,721
who're stuck up, stuck up there

831
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:45,912
roots are dead

832
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:49,662
and they 're stuck up like dead deep root somewhere.

833
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:52,170
So to shake them is not easy,

834
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,560
talk to them is not easy,

835
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,935
to convince them is not at all easy because they think

836
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,935
see they are all wise, Madrasies think they are the wisest.

837
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,901
people as far as religion is concerned

838
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:05,346
and I don't know where to look when they say that.

839
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,957
See this is the trouble is.

840
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:10,425
So with that understanding if you face

841
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:15,170
because also, I think, Venugopalan told Me,

842
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,219
"Mother, I'm sure it won't happen

843
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,960
to the real Tamilians."

844
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:22,355
I said, "Why?" He said, "They're no good,

845
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,712
they can never get it,

846
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:25,845
because I'm a Tamilian I know what it is."

847
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,866
So I said, "Cannot happen to Tamilians?"

848
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:30,055
He said, "No, because Murthy is not a Tamilian,

849
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,055
Jayakar is not a Tamilian.

850
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,356
They cannot be Tamilians.

851
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:35,360
" I said, "Let's see the Tamilians also."

852
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:40,606
He just could not think that Tamilians can take to it

853
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:43,761
He said they are so dead into it, they cannot.

854
00:43:44,044 --> 00:43:47,097
We have so many now Tamilians also in

855
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:52,037
Delhi but how many come to us, very few.

856
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
So,

857
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,200
Can you open the fan now?

858
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,333
You start, who else will start.

859
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:23,090
Can put that also. It's al   right, it won't go.

860
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,879
Not so much you can put it little less

861
00:44:31,994 --> 00:44:33,414
you see, little movement.

862
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:37,927
You didn't feel the hot, till the electricity had not come.

863
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:39,554
Do you notice that?

864
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:42,375
Didn't feel the hot at all.

865
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,551
As soon as the electricity has come you have started feeling hot.

866
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,024
I told him, "You don't worry I'll throw cold at them,

867
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:53,211
they won't feel."

868
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:55,935
None of you felt.

869
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,749
As soon as the electricity has come you're feeling hot.

870
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,126
What have you got?

871
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:07,251
What is this?

872
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,782
Kammer patta (Waist Belt ornament, worn around the waist).

873
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
No that green coloured

874
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,440
Yogi: That is. S M: Yes? Yogi: It's Tulsi.

875
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb basil)

876
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,840
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb)

877
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Yogi: Pachu (Precious Stones)  S M Anh?

878
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,360
Yogi: Madras people come into the front.

879
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,400
Yogi: Madras people to come.

880
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
Yogi:Dawana( Fragrant Herb)

881
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
Yogi: Its a Dawana,   S M :Its a Dawana

882
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
S M: That is not Dawana

883
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,040
Dawana and Tulasi ( Herbs)

884
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,320
It is Dawana

885
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,960
It is Dawana

886
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,400
Where is Tulsi ? Tulsi is less

887
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,320
Yogi: Some is not Tulsi. SM: Huh

888
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,440
Smelling nice

889
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,960
Yogi: Which flowers are these? S M: Its Ok

890
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,960
All right!

891
00:46:43,824 --> 00:46:46,156
There's one thing we are missed on this,

892
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,242
which I want to tell you about the Vedas now, as I told you

893
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:54,440
In one lecture you can't cover the whole thing but in short

894
00:46:55,537 --> 00:46:57,573
that how they went into the

895
00:46:58,308 --> 00:47:01,295
abstraction of the chakras. Some might, might say

896
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:03,514
that they didn't talk about the chakras,

897
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:05,400
you see, because this is what they are

898
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:08,368
it, it's not in the Vedas, it should not be anywhere else.

899
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:11,493
I mean supposing in the beginning that was the situation

900
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:13,739
then today this is the situation.

901
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,375
Like, when a electricity started

902
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,148
nobody knew much about, it they could hardly put

903
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:23,628
a little flickering light, now today

904
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,027
we have this, we have that, we don't refuse this

905
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,960
because it was not there so it should not be there

906
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,666
You see evolving and it is

907
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:31,966
in aware, our awareness, it is coming.

908
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,855
But they will always say, it's not written in that book.

909
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,159
Book and that not into that.

910
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:38,960
First time somebody wrote about Kundalini was actually

911
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:42,306
I should say in a real sense of the word wrote properly

912
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,178
was Adi Shankaracharya himself

913
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:47,616
and then our, what you call, Gyaneshwara

914
00:47:47,725 --> 00:47:48,960
because that was the time

915
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:50,960
and before that of course

916
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:54,486
Markandeya wrote it, thousands of years back but

917
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,689
who considered Markandeya as something, no one listened to him.

918
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,375
So if the Vedas become everything they will say

919
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,935
then what about your chakras, there's nothing in the Vedas.

920
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,215
So it could be in some other books.

921
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,223
Now Bhrigusamhita has written,

922
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,660
Bhrigu has written a book called Nadi Granth, in that

923
00:48:11,685 --> 00:48:13,677
he has described complete sahaja yoga.

924
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:15,960
He said that Kundalini will rise and this will happen.

925
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,550
So the knowledge of the Kundalini we had since long

926
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,831
but it was kept as a secret

927
00:48:22,052 --> 00:48:24,791
and was not discussed by the Sushumna people

928
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:27,610
and they are the ones

929
00:48:27,635 --> 00:48:30,317
who formed this Machindernath, Gorakhnath all these people.

930
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,552
Most of this work was done in Maharashtra.

931
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,705
Most of it was done in Maharashtra

932
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:38,783
and that's how we have the Sushumna path in the central path

933
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:43,095
of ascent or realization was kept as a secret

934
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,354
and we can say that there were two,

935
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:48,180
two or one or two flowers

936
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:49,960
one or two flowers

937
00:48:51,294 --> 00:48:53,073
on the tree of life

938
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,960
but now we have many flowers.

939
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,711
That's how we can tell.

940
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:00,109
Then the essence how they discussed is that

941
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,840
see, what they say "bhu"

942
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:05,905
Bhu is the essence

943
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:09,863
of Mooladhara- made from the Prithvi tattwa.

944
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:13,323
Bhurva is the antriksh.

945
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:17,672
Bhurva is the essence by which it was made the Bhurva.

946
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,656
was made the antriksha, means all the elements and all that,

947
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,366
is Brahmdeva's job.

948
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:25,960
You call it Brahmdeva or Bhurva is the same,

949
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,087
is the shakti of Brahmdeva is Bhurva.

950
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,960
So Bhu Bhurva Swaha.

951
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:35,116
the stomach is Swaha

952
00:49:35,444 --> 00:49:40,386
The shakti of the stomach is Swaha.

953
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:42,960
Swaha is what

954
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:49,000
to take everything in, burn it, digest it, swaha

955
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:54,702
Then 'Manaha' is the essence of the

956
00:49:54,835 --> 00:49:56,560
heart chakra is manaha

957
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,323
is mana, is the emotions

958
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:03,758
is the mana, is the Parmesh God's emotions.

959
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,905
is in the heart is Jagdamba there.

960
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,960
Mana Jana

961
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:13,053
is Shri Krishna, is for the jana.

962
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:17,654
Jana is when Shri Krishna came on this Earth,

963
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:20,347
when He thought of the people.

964
00:50:20,488 --> 00:50:23,781
He mixed with the people, He talked to them, He tried to spread

965
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:27,633
and He's the Virata, so He is a collective,

966
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:28,960
He's the collective being -

967
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:33,152
so Jana Tapa, Tapa is Shri Christ

968
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:35,960
because He went into tapaswita.

969
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:37,920
His life was a tapasya,

970
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:39,336
He went into tapa

971
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:41,359
and the last is Satya,

972
00:50:41,396 --> 00:50:43,610
at the Sahasrara you know the truth.

973
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,211
So all these seven things

974
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,960
essence of all the chakras they are describing over here,

975
00:50:53,577 --> 00:50:55,413
in the Vedas

976
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,959
but these, they will argue,

977
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,840
they'll say the mantra of Gayatri, this, that, what is that ?

978
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:04,421
Gayatri is the essence

979
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,485
and that's the trouble with them is.

980
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,618
By saying these mantras they go to the right side

981
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:12,960
they are not there on the essence.

982
00:51:13,212 --> 00:51:14,589
the whole thing get's spoilt.

983
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,448
Specially in Kashmir, I must say,

984
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,704
they suffer from this Gayatri mantra.

985
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,108
And the worst thing, that has happened to us

986
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:27,960
now I don't know about other places but specially in Maharashtra

987
00:51:28,312 --> 00:51:31,689
we are two types of horrible Brahmins

988
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:35,087
and there are other very good types of Brahmins also.

989
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,840
But the bad ones I'm telling

990
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:40,763
the ones who, who look after the temples

991
00:51:41,029 --> 00:51:42,776
and manage the temples

992
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:45,624
and they think, Oh! we know what is God is,

993
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,313
there's nothing like or we have made this God,

994
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,960
God is all this is just a stone, we know how to manage.

995
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,427
it's all Swayambhu and all this nonsense.

996
00:51:54,631 --> 00:51:57,220
So they, they are least afraid of God.

997
00:51:57,388 --> 00:51:59,935
They do all kinds of things, without being afraid of God

998
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,754
because they think there is no God really, it's just a joke

999
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,414
so one thing cancel.

1000
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:07,663
Second thing is that

1001
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:11,203
the people who are sort of educated out of them,

1002
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,960
they think it's dishonest to say, there is God

1003
00:52:13,985 --> 00:52:15,973
because there is no God, better to say there is no God.

1004
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:18,935
Out of them have come out these Samajwadi's, you see,

1005
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,400
socialist like Kirloskar,

1006
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:22,375
Gorey all these people.

1007
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,763
They openly say there's no God

1008
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,960
openly.

1009
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,360
So that is how it is.

1010
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,410
Now,we have to understand that

1011
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,960
we are real Brahmins

1012
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,960
no doubt, assume your powers.

1013
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:50,512
know that you are real brahmins, you are the Brahmins.

1014
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:52,504
None of these are brahmin

1015
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,684
because you know the Brahm, this is the Brahm tattwa,

1016
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,610
you know how to handle it, you know the vibration.

1017
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:57,960
Chaitanya is the Brahm.

1018
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,960
Of course you are different than them

1019
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,671
so they are not allowed to enter into any temple, as you are.

1020
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:13,485
One day will come when that will happen you'll see that.

1021
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:16,519
we have to change the whole system upside down,

1022
00:53:16,636 --> 00:53:17,960
otherwise things won't work out.

1023
00:53:19,126 --> 00:53:20,916
The whole system has to be changed

1024
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:26,531
but still, because this a yoga bhumi

1025
00:53:26,966 --> 00:53:29,945
still, you can find the truth in this Motherearth.

1026
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,550
Saints and saints have born.

1027
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,935
they have talked about all these things,

1028
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,602
so there is no chance of abusing anything much,

1029
00:53:38,923 --> 00:53:41,162
cannot go to Mooladhara of that action

1030
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,519
that we understand.

1031
00:53:44,173 --> 00:53:46,972
At least that wisdom we have we, we won't go that side

1032
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:48,704
that's the worst of all.

1033
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Mother: For washing My feet, you do this,
 remove it  from underneath

1034
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Now call Madras yogies to wash the feet,

1035
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,360
Keep water here and recite Ganesha Stotra.

1036
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Now do this, the one who in going to recite Mantras,

1037
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,960
will not do that thing,

1038
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
You come here, you understand everything.

1039
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,960
You recite the Mantra, you recite the Mantra
and you can recite there

1040
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,960
You bring the water.

1041
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,320
You are catching badly,

1042
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,200
You can get somebody else.

1043
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,960
Dani you come here.

1044
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,040
All are from Madras or else where?

1045
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,200
Yes, you come here.

1046
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,120
You just move there.

1047
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,080
feeling of a very strong catch,feeling hot vibrations? You see!

1048
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,160
It's very hot,

1049
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,960
Pick up

1050
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,960
God bless you! No

1051
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,160
Pour the water.

1052
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,400
Now recite.

1053
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,200
Now this is what it is washing My feet

1054
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,080
with the Ganesha stotram

1055
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,960
start this.

1056
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,080
Those who have not washed My feet raise their hands

1057
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,960
Yogis: Those who have not washed Mother's feet, those

1058
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,960
who have not washed previously

1059
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
Two persons

1060
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,960
You are still moving with  the ladle [Marathi]

1061
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
What you have

1062
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,960
Alright!

1063
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,280
Like that

1064
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,360
on the right

1065
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,960
