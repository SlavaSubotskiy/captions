00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:04,779
Public Program, Royal Albert Hall, London,
11 June 1992

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,529
I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the
very outset we have to know that truth is

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,630
what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot
conceptualize it. We have to know it. For

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,020
example, today science has become our God.
But you can’t know truth through science.

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,620
It may solve some problems, one by one, but
it is not conclusive. It doesn’t reach you

6
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:11,129
anywhere. It has created this problem, as
you know, the conference in New York from

7
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,350
where the Goddess [sounds like a person’s
name] has come just now. [?] was telling Me

8
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,350
the story that they don’t know what to do,
how to solve the problem. Then the violence.

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,820
It cannot stop violence because it is amoral.
It has no morality in it. It doesn’t tell

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,200
you how to transcend. It doesn’t tell you
that you are a spirit. He doesn’t know we

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,520
can say it does not know what the soul is.
It does work out in a way, but I must say

12
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:05,039
Sahaja Yoga works out much faster, in a much
simpler way. And if you take to Sahaja Yoga

13
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,579
you’ll be convinced, despite all your conditionings
and cynicism, that Sahaja Yoga is the Meta

14
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,599
Science, is above science, above. With Sahaja
Yoga, once you get your realization automatically

15
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,849
you get cured, automatically.

16
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:41,849
This Kundalini which is your Mother, individual
Mother, She rises, passes through these centers

17
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,650
and these centers are the basics within us
because when they are in your body you get

18
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,760
all these troubles, sicknesses, cancer, all
kinds of incurable diseases, all kinds of

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,760
mental troubles and spiritual problems due
to wrong seeking. I have seen people in England

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,200
itself, so many of them got rid of their drug
addiction overnight with Kundalini awakening.

21
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,200
It is their own power which has worked it
out. It does work.

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,200
There are three doctors in Delhi University
who have got their MD in curing incurable

23
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,280
diseases. We have people definitely suffering
from all kinds of problems of muscular disabilities

24
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,280
or cancers of various types, even AIDS, I
would say. It has worked wonders with that.

25
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,189
No doubt it works. How?

26
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:06,189
There is another science beyond this science.
There is another world beyond this world which

27
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:14,209
we do not know, about which all the saints
have told us. The vision of that great life

28
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,140
is described by a great seer. We call it a
[Brachta?], a great visionary, William Blake

29
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,220
of this country. He said the sleeping Albion,
the sleeping country, has to awake and arise.

30
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,360
That was not imagination. That was his real
penetration into the reality which he described.

31
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,120
But science cannot go into that dimension.
That exists for all of us but we are so conditioned

32
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:00,610
that we cannot accept it that such a thing
can exist. I don’t know when it started

33
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:07,610
the deviation, maybe Galileo’s invention
of a telescope, maybe. I don’t know what

34
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,830
happened that people started giving up philosophy
and taking to science, to economics, and now

35
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:27,889
everything has become nothing but economics
and money, everything. You can’t find truth

36
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,400
by paying. But one has to think there must
be something else; otherwise are we all going

37
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:50,509
to be destroyed by these unlimited endeavors
we have in all kinds of destructive areas.

38
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:00,490
Science was all right to begin with but it
has no limitation. It doesn’t keep to that

39
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,490
point where now we have started derailing
into our destruction. Where have we gone wrong?

40
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,080
We have no control. We have no discretion.
So people turn, say, to religion. Now religion

41
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,940
is also, as you know, is a farce because it
is also money-oriented or it is power-oriented.

42
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,220
It is not at all spirit-oriented. No religion
is now today. Take any religion, whether they

43
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:43,220
like it or not. Of course the prophets, the
incarnations, the seers, the saints, sages,

44
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:56,240
all of them knew the truth. They were absolutely
there where we have to go. But later on people

45
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:13,129
thought it is not reality; what we discovered
through science is reality. If it is so, why

46
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:22,330
such problems are coming to us? Why all our
enterprises are boomeranging on us? We don’t

47
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,340
even realize that we are becoming now slaves
of this so-called modern scientific world.

48
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,520
We can’t calculate two plus two.

49
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Also it’s very surprising that we do not
realize how we are playing into the hands

50
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,470
of entrepreneurs. My granddaughters were with
Me in Italy and they wanted to buy some nice

51
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,509
long skirts because they are still, you see,
not so much sophisticated. And you’ll be

52
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:21,180
surprised; no shop had any skirts of that
kind. They had now only of six inches and

53
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,180
eight inches because somebody, some mad person,
must have taken out this idea in Paris and

54
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,260
we have to wear those dresses. Otherwise we
are not in. People will laugh at us. If you

55
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,860
wear long [Shri Mataji said “long” but
She meant to say “short”] dresses in this

56
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,100
cold, imagine! Especially in England. What’s
the sense in wearing these short dresses?

57
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,100
I can’t understand. I can understand in
a place on the Equator where it is so hot.

58
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,770
Nonsensical inventions come out and we think,
“Oh, it’s great because it is new.”

59
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,150
What are we going to do with these telescopes?
What is the need to go to the moon? What did

60
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,330
you achieve? Did you solve the problem of
poverty in our country? [She said first “in

61
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,990
this” then corrected “in our country”.]
Wasted so much money. So there is an inborn

62
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,990
force in all our adventures which tries to
bring us down, put us down.

63
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Now the psychological problem is another.
That’s a force, inner force which is working

64
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:47,330
out and teaching us. Sickness is another.
When you do things which are not natural,

65
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,500
go to the extremes, sickness comes in. There
is no discretion. There is no direction. We

66
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,120
do not know what is our future is.

67
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,010
Now science has discovered DNA. Of course,
scientist are quite shocked by that. It’s

68
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,660
a big question mark for them. But they’ll
go to DNA. They’ll try to find out what

69
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,690
was the origin of man. What is the need to
know the origin of man? We should know the

70
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,270
future of man now. If you know what is the
origin, what are you going to gain out of

71
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:32,270
that? Have you to become now animals? Or have
you to become something higher?

72
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,820
In this great country of England there have
been great seers who have talked about, who

73
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:56,350
have wrote about the great visions they had
about the English, the Wales, the Scots. But

74
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,070
they were considered as mad people because
our conditionings are such that we don’t

75
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,650
think it is mad to become punk or to become
a hippy. We don’t think that way.

76
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:21,650
The other day I saw a gentleman with big holes
in his pant. I asked him, “What’s this

77
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,930
going on?”
He said, “It’s a holey pant.” [Indian

78
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,930
words sounds like jailwai]”. And I said,
“But mister, this holey pant will give you

79
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,800
some sort of trouble because it’s a very
cold country.” “No, we are having a holey

80
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:41,760
pant.”

81
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,720
To dress up funny, to make your hair in a
funny way, is that’s the way you are going

82
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,770
to change yourself inside? What is the reason?
Why we cannot solve our ecological problem?

83
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Is the human being, he has to transform himself.
And when he is transformed, the first thing

84
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:14,400
which happens to him that he becomes collectively
conscious. You start feeling others on your

85
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:23,770
fingertips, you can feel others their centers,
you can feel others, and an upsurge of compassion,

86
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,650
upsurge.

87
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:33,650
I went to Russia and I was surprised in Russia
that so many Germans, Germans Sahaja yogis

88
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,280
flew to help Me out. So surprised at them.
I said, “You’re given up your jobs or

89
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,580
something?”
They said, “No, we are taking a leave and

90
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,910
come.” I said, “Why?” “Mother, don’t
you think it is our responsibility? What our

91
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:03,500
forefathers have done we have to rectify.
We have to help them.”

92
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,500
We talk of democracy, this liberal democracy.
Churchill himself has said that is the worst

93
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,440
type of government is democratic, but I don’t
know anything of better; so better have it.

94
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,450
All these things make you abnormal when you
have so many choices. Choices of what? Choices

95
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,480
of clothes, choices of food, choices of these
stones and ashes. What about the choice of

96
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,640
our future life? What about the progeny that
is going to come? What are we going to give

97
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,260
them? Plastics?

98
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Then some people intelligent, you have to
have superior type of intelligence. Think

99
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,800
about it. There must be some solution; so
they become seekers. William Blake has said,

100
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,280
he called them men of God, and they will seek
and they will become Divine and they’ll

101
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:38,390
make others Divine. He has prophesized it.
All his prophecies can be absolutely executed,

102
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,710
can be manifested in this great country of
Great Britain. But first we should get out

103
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,970
of our conditionings.

104
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,970
The first conditioning is that anything which
comes from East is stupid, while anything

105
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,640
that comes from West is the best. Of course,
one has to learn about science. One has to

106
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,820
learn about so many things. There are so many
good things about West. But if in the East

107
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,820
there is something good, after all we human
beings only separate East, West, North, South,

108
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Black, White, this, that. God does not. So
if there is something that is going to nourish

109
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,360
our roots, whether it comes from East, North,
South, anywhere, why not take it? Whatever

110
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,600
is good for our benevolence, why not accept
it? All right. Then people came out with these

111
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,600
ideas, and I am sorry to say from our India
lots of horrible people were exported. And

112
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,070
thousands and thousands joined these hypocritical
people.

113
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:08,070
But for Sahaja Yoga, no. Because what is the
basic difference in Sahaja Yoga and any other

114
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:16,130
nonsensical thing like that is that here you
cannot pay. You have to become. What is important

115
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,520
is what you become. You cannot become a member
of Sahaja Yoga. You cannot. We do not have

116
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,520
any organization like that. You have to become
yourself ,and there is divinity all within

117
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,870
yourself. I verily say to you that, “Don’t
condemn yourself.” By no means. You are

118
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,280
at the epitome of evolution, and what you
have to get is just humble down and see for

119
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,910
yourself that in your heart resides the spirit.
And you have all the divinity, all the powers

120
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,760
which are above this science. For a diagnosis
of a person, they will kill that person with

121
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:20,790
that diagnosis in the medical profession.
But in Sahaja Yoga anybody can tell you what’s

122
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,510
wrong with you on the fingertips. It’s a
fact. It’s the truth. But how many years

123
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,080
it’s going to take for people to accept
the truth? As it is I’ve been here for eighteen

124
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,080
years; no, this is the nineteen year I am
here. Whatever one may say what Marx has done,

125
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,640
Marxism, one has to ask question. He could
have been right in some ways, and when I went

126
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,640
to Russia I did feel that one thing he did
was take out the attention of people from

127
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,500
materialism. It’s a fact. We always had
sixteen thousand, twenty thousand people and

128
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,920
in one place called [Togliati] there are twenty
thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

129
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,920
One day this Russia will be the greatest country,
if not India.

130
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,800
If we have lost our soul, if we have lost
our connection with that Divine Power which

131
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,540
is the Power of God Almighty, then what are
we going to be left with? What are we going

132
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:45,540
to win? Drug addicts? AIDS? Homosexual? This
nonsense? That nonsense? We should have our

133
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:56,540
self-esteem. We must know that God has not
created us to be wasted like this.

134
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:05,050
It’s the first time I allowed them to show
some of these pictures because I know the

135
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:12,050
mind here is so clever that they can cheat
themselves. They start saying, “Oh, this

136
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,650
must be arranged. This must be organized.”
For what should we arrange and organize logically?

137
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:26,650
We are well-off people. We have nothing to
gain from you. We don’t need any money.

138
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,120
The people now who have come to Sahaja Yoga
are angelic people; you’ll be surprised.

139
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,840
We have no difference of races, no difference
of religion, no difference of nationality

140
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,840
and all these things that create problems.
We believe in all the prophets and all the

141
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:59,630
religions but we do not hate any religion.
We are not fundamentalist. That’s why all

142
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,440
the fundamentalists are angry with us, because
how dare you love all the religions, because

143
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,780
they are all one. Fundamentally they are one,
which you can understand once you get your

144
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,280
realization.

145
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,280
After realization you can feel the truth on
your fingertips and you can find out all these

146
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,850
people who they were. Christ Himself has said,
“Those who are not against Me, are with

147
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,770
Me.” Who are those? All this fundamentalism
has created a problem today and that is the

148
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:39,770
greatest problem, as good as ecological problem,
I think. We have people from all the religions,

149
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:51,860
as I told you, and the compassion and love
that they have. I’ve never seen them fighting,

150
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:01,540
quarrelling, hitting, violent, abusing. Such
decent, beautiful citizen they have become.

151
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,270
Honest. We all have to be like that.

152
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,810
Only thing you must know your own powers.
You must know what you are. And the truth

153
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:27,810
is that you are the spirit. You are not this
body, not this mind. You are the spirit which

154
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,780
you have to become. And the another truth
is that there is an All-pervading Power which

155
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,780
you may call by any name, like “Ruh”,
like the All-pervading Power of Divine Love,

156
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:49,870
or Brahmachaitanya. Call by any name, it’s
there. You have to just get connected with

157
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:57,130
it. All the powers start flowing through you.
Do you mean to say that all these great saints

158
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:06,290
and incarnations and prophets were telling
us lies? But not just reading their books,

159
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:19,330
not by reciting their names, not by being
fundamentalist; but by becoming a realized

160
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:30,250
soul that you understand every one of them.
You integrate within yourself and without.

161
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:44,230
Tomorrow I am going to tell you what the spirit
works out in you when you get your Self-realization,

162
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,670
and also we’ll have a session of Self-realization.
Today not, tomorrow. First, you just don’t

163
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:07,060
be thinking about it, arguing about it. You
cannot argue. It is beyond your mind. And

164
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:15,590
it is not Aristotle did say that there is
a world beyond the moon and one below the

165
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,010
moon. We live in the below the moon. But there
is another world beyond which we have to know.

166
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:29,010
All of you have the right to know. And Sahaja
means born with you. Is the right to get union

167
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:37,460
with that All-pervading Power. Is your birthright
and you all can have it. So why not have it?

168
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,510
Of course, there are many fundamentalists
who may write against us, because they think

169
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:52,510
we go against them. It’s not a fact. They
do not want you to change. They want you to

170
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,900
belong to their clubs by which they could
fight, denounce others. The whole world is

171
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:10,750
created by One God. How can we fight in the
name of God? Not only fighting. They are doing

172
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,400
all kind of things. You know that. All kinds
of horrible things they are doing in the name

173
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,400
of God. But after realization, we don’t
have to tell you anything. You just do what

174
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:32,580
is righteous. You become that kind of a personality,
so powerful as that, I assure you. Tomorrow,

175
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,630
please, all of you come along again.

176
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,930
Today there was a bomb scare. Imagine! What
a stupid thing people are doing wasting their

177
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:52,930
life. For what did you come on this earth?
To create bombs, scare, kill people, murder

178
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,960
someone? I mean, they are worse than animals
sometimes.

179
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,580
Tomorrow call also your friends, everyone.
First time in England we have spoken so openly

180
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,760
about Sahaja Yoga, because they always said,
“Mother ,if You say something very openly,

181
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,559
they will never understand. You should not
tell them. You should try to pamper their

182
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:26,559
ego all the time and should not say much about
Sahaja Yoga. Let them get their realization.”

183
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,760
And you will be surprised; the reaction was
that we may have people about, say, three

184
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,570
hundred, four hundred, out of which two would
come to the program. Even Indians here are,

185
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:45,570
I must say. Not in India. In India thousands,
thousands have taken to Sahaja Yoga, thousands.

186
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,250
It is their heritage, but they have also lost
their heritage and they are doing such a tremendous

187
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:02,350
work. With Sahaja Yoga you can nourish crops;
you can nourish your animals. In science you

188
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,980
cannot do. You have to play into the hands
of organizations who produce seeds for you,

189
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:26,170
hybrid seeds. In Sahaja Yoga none hybrid seeds
can be vibrated, and you can get much more

190
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:33,410
crops than you get from these hybrid seeds.
Then we eat those hybrid seeds, hybrid animals,

191
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,960
and our attention also becomes hybrid. We
are no more natural then.

192
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,080
How it is done is very simple because once
you are connected to the mains, for example,

193
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,710
this is connected to the mains and you can
hear Me. How it is done? Because it is built

194
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:11,710
in. It is built in within you, this power.
It acts and it works. Only thing is that first

195
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:22,110
of all this connection has to be little bit
fixed. Of course, you don’t have to pay

196
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:30,550
for anything, one thing for sure. We have
tried and tried and tried in this country.

197
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,450
And do you know that England is the heart
of the universe? Whatever happens here circulates.

198
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:48,450
It’s a great responsibility on all the residents
of this country to understand what is their

199
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:58,420
work and they have to take to something which
is so important in these modern times.

200
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Thank you very much. Tomorrow I hope to see
you all. Those who will be real honest seekers

201
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,920
will definitely come, I am sure, and bring
your friends and invite them. There is nothing

202
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,920
more is to be given, nothing higher to be
given. It’s the highest where you get your

203
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:28,610
peace, joy, compassion and complete security.
This is how you enter into the Kingdom of

204
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:39,770
God which has been promised. All the promises
are to be fulfilled.

205
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:46,770
Please remember that to doubt is a very good
idea because that means you are free, but

206
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:57,670
to get Self-realization is the best because
you become absolutely a free person. Nothing

207
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:07,070
can dominate you. Real freedom is only after
Self-realization.

208
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:14,070
I hope all of you will respect yourself and
come tomorrow, and I am sure we will definitely

209
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,190
work it out.

210
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:26,190
We can see these people coming from different
countries. They sing Sanskrit songs. They

211
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:33,380
haven’t sang today. Even the Indians can’t
sing like that. Adi Shankaracharya has completely

212
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,450
think that they can sing, how can they? I
mean, I had never known English people speaking

213
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:50,370
Indian language so easily. In olden days when
they were there rahaj they had for one sentence,

214
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:57,370
you know you had to break your head with them.
If you have to say, “Open the door,” they

215
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,110
say ‒ they couldn’t say that; that is
Darwaja Khol Dey ‒ so they used to say,

216
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:12,580
“There was a cold day.” In English they
would say this, meaning Darwaja Khol Dey.

217
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,480
It was so difficult. But look at their tongues,
what has happened to them.

218
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,480
There are many musicians, artists who have
risen very high in life after coming to Sahaja

219
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Yoga. So for all the artists, musicians it’s
a kind of a temptation I am giving but that’s

220
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:41,100
just a temptation. Actually you have [just]
to achieve that supreme position from where

221
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,800
you can give it to others and you are in power.

222
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,100
May God bless you all.
