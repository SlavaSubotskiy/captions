1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,173
So now we have talked
about Bhairava and

2
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:09,650
we have seen how
negativity acts within us,

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,730
and how we get caught up.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,610
So,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,560
I would say that, we must
always keep in mind,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,990
that we have a soul

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,480
and that soul can be attacked.

8
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,874
It has been already
attacked when with all

9
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:30,064
the kinds of things we have
had in these modern lives,

10
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,704
it's already under attack.

11
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,864
But now we have to
cleanse it, and put it right.

12
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:39,744
If you really want to enjoy Sahaja
Yoga and cleanse yourself

13
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,744
then you have to understand
that we need lot of introspection

14
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,934
- lot of introspection.

15
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:49,934
Now the people who are
left-sided are sort of,

16
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:52,452
they are not straightforward

17
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:56,660
and they are sly and
they talk ill about others.

18
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:58,774
Last time I discovered that in Perth

19
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,844
there was a lot of things
people were talking and,

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,684
I wanted to remind you again
that I heard about it,

21
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:09,044
also that even now in Australia

22
00:01:09,764 --> 00:01:11,844
that kind of people are still there,

23
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,834
who just start at the
back saying things.

24
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,794
One person says something,
another listens to it

25
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,754
and it's very very bad thing,

26
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,754
because talking ill about others
means you first of all

27
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,754
you get the ill within you.

28
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,834
The second thing is that
the way you propagate

29
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:29,904
you stop Divinity spreading out.

30
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:32,864
Thirdly you grow into
negativity yourself

31
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:37,664
and to whomsoever you talk
that person also gets infected,

32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,864
it's like a disease.

33
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,864
So I think in Australia throughout
we have to be very careful

34
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:46,814
because we have had two
big somersaults you can say,

35
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:50,694
with big falling
because of this only,

36
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,734
that secretly, and this is a side,

37
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:56,734
I would say Australia
is very left-sided

38
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,724
otherwise also
because Ganesha's place.

39
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,764
That's why Ganesha
was placed here,

40
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:04,004
to save you and to put you right

41
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:07,884
as far as the left side is concerned.

42
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,884
And we have to be very cautious

43
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,844
because that temperament develops,

44
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,764
you know, depend on.

45
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:15,954
Like also it is in England quite a lot,

46
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:19,794
but say not in America,
say not in Austria,

47
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,914
not in Russia, Germany,

48
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,794
they are on the contrary open
and they can be aggressive,

49
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,994
but they are not sly.

50
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,824
So either you are aggressive
or you are sly.

51
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,664
Accordingly you must
find out within yourself

52
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:36,704
what's wrong with you
and where are we wrong.

53
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,664
Because after all we
are Sahaja Yogis,

54
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,984
it's a great chance we have got

55
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:41,824
that we have got our Realization,

56
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:44,814
and that now we have reached
a stage where we really

57
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,814
are placed in the Kingdom of God.

58
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:53,974
But now how far you go
into it depends only on you.

59
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:56,614
Now Russia why we
were successful

60
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,614
because people are
very introspective.

61
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,804
If you read any book
of Russian writers

62
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,804
like Tolstoy or anyone,

63
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:05,884
anything they do, say even when
they fall in love or anything,

64
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,884
immediately they
start introspecting:

65
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:10,924
'Why, why am I falling in love?

66
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:12,884
Why this happening to me?

67
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,874
Why I'm thinking like that?
Why I'm doing like that?'

68
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:17,714
You see they introspect,

69
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,834
and that introspection if we
do not have within ourselves

70
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,754
then, what happens that we can go

71
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,794
either to the right or to the left.

72
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:29,864
But in this country I see
it's more the left side,

73
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:31,864
sly things are there.

74
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,664
Now how all this
has happened that

75
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:38,904
we had some horrible leaders,

76
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:42,824
agreed and instead
of talking about it

77
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:44,854
or telling Me about it,

78
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:48,574
they all just started talking
among themselves and all that

79
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,774
and they got all their bad qualities

80
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:52,814
sort of combined within themselves

81
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,854
and that's how so many
lost their vibrations

82
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,712
and lost their, what should I say,

83
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,684
the searching power.

84
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:06,644
So when you see a person,

85
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,884
or anyone who is doing wrong,

86
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,764
better is to forget about it.

87
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:15,594
Or if you don't forget then
you should write to Me,

88
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,594
even if you don't do that

89
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:20,594
better go and talk to
that person on his face

90
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,594
that: 'I think this is not right.'

91
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:25,914
But if you write to
Me it can be solved,

92
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:27,714
problem can be solved.

93
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,584
Say now you have one
Mr X as your leader

94
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,704
or anybody here who is

95
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:34,544
coming say,

96
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,664
from New Zealand,

97
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,624
or someone from outside.

98
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,864
Immediately you should find out,

99
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:43,544
are you critical of him?

100
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,854
What are you looking at that person?

101
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,654
What are you trying to find
out about that person?

102
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:54,654
If you are critical then know
that you can never progress.

103
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,694
You should be critical
about yourself,

104
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:00,604
not about others,

105
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,684
know that you
are most imperfect,

106
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:03,844
that's the best way.

107
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:06,804
Like we had a child
about nine year old,

108
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,884
and he was extremely sly type

109
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:13,764
and,

110
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,674
he was talking ill like this of
this person to that person and

111
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,794
he would go and just
jump on to someone,

112
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:24,634
and hit someone, secretly.

113
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,754
Not openly.

114
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,834
So I called the child
and I asked him:

115
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:29,634
'What do you think of yourself?

116
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,744
Do you think you are the
most perfect person?'

117
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,824
He said: 'Yes, I do'

118
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:35,624
I said: 'That's it.

119
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,664
It's finished.'

120
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:39,704
Such a person cannot improve.

121
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:43,504
So when you try to find
faults with others

122
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,854
know that we have too
many faults ourselves.

123
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,654
Not to feel guilty - of course,
that point is there also.

124
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,654
you should never feel
guilty about it.

125
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,734
If you have faults just see:

126
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,534
"What faults do I have?

127
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:55,694
How will I correct?

128
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,534
What chakras I am catching?"

129
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,804
Instead of seeing the
chakras of others,

130
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,724
if you see your own, then
you'll become purified,

131
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:06,604
you'll be very clean, you'll be wonderful,

132
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,524
everything will be fine.

133
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:13,564
But if you cannot see
your own faults,

134
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:17,834
that means you haven't
yet got your Self-Realization.

135
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,634
Self-Realization means to
know about your Self,

136
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:24,834
and this - the last time I did
say all these things here in Perth

137
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:26,714
and also otherwise, that if you

138
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:30,784
talk about somebody like
that to spread stories.

139
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:32,864
Ladies specially should be careful

140
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:34,544
because they are on the left,

141
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,464
they have to be very, very careful,

142
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,464
that they start judging others.

143
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,464
They think they are
perfect, they judge,

144
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:41,464
they tell their husbands,

145
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:42,704
then husband tells another husband,

146
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,624
then husband tells his
wife - it spreads.

147
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,774
You have to be extremely
wise and sensible women.

148
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:54,494
If you are not sensible
this will spread like a disease.

149
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:58,454
In Sahaja Yoga this is one
of the diseases I dread,

150
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:01,604
is what Christ has
called: "Murmuring souls."

151
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:04,644
He said: "Beware of
the murmuring souls!"

152
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,644
Leaders are also afraid
to tell you something.

153
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,644
If they tell you something
immediately you'll start saying

154
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,724
"Oh, Mother said so
- he's saying so."

155
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,634
Whatever the leader is
saying you must listen to him,

156
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,674
must obey him, ask him

157
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:21,474
what, does he mean by
saying this, what is it?

158
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,714
Now in case you find something
wrong with the leader

159
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:25,594
you are all free to write to Me,

160
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,474
and I will definitely go into it,

161
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,514
for example, Stephen wrote
to Me about someone

162
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,424
and I went into this,

163
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,544
enquired and found out
what was the thing.

164
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:35,504
You see so there's no harm,

165
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:37,664
in finding out about someone.

166
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,704
Some lady wrote to Me
also and I found it.

167
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:45,574
So but unnecessarily paying
attention to another person

168
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,414
is not a good thing.

169
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,654
Paying attention to yourself

170
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:51,654
and looking all the good
points of another person,

171
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:53,534
of helping another person,

172
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,574
that's how we would be collective,

173
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,494
we'll be growing faster

174
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:59,414
and we'll be enjoying ourselves.

175
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:01,404
Now our children are here.

176
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:06,724
Now, what I find that
we do not know really

177
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:11,604
what are the balanced ways
of looking after our children.

178
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:14,684
So some think that when
I said they are realized souls,

179
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:17,434
so they said, "All right, let
them do what they like."

180
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:20,514
It's not true,
otherwise if that is so

181
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:23,514
they would have been born
out of the trees, you see.

182
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,434
Why are they born out of you?

183
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,674
So you have a responsibility

184
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,754
whether they are realized or not.

185
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:32,744
You have a responsibility
about your children

186
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,584
and you have to see
that you correct them.

187
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:37,464
It's very important.

188
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:40,384
Some people I've seen
allow their children

189
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:44,624
to go just so mad and
so, they go so amok.

190
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:49,574
In this I would say an Indian
parent is an ideal parent.

191
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,494
What he will do, he
looks after the child.

192
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:56,534
Also, in a way he loves,

193
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,454
expresses his love and all that,

194
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,724
but if he finds anything
wrong with the child

195
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,524
immediately he'll
correct - immediately,

196
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:07,444
not spare him, in the
presence of others.

197
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,724
Now, if another person comes
and tells about the child,

198
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,444
that this child has done,

199
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:15,474
immediately he will scold the child.

200
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:17,474
He will never get angry with
the another person:

201
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,434
"Why did you say
about my child now?"

202
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,594
But thank him and that
"Thank God you have told me";

203
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,594
because he might be spoiled more.

204
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:28,714
Like I'll tell you we had one Avadhut

205
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,704
- now he's a grown up boy,
but when he was young,

206
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,664
one day he asked Me that,

207
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:36,464
"If you leave your parents their,

208
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:39,504
the baddhas of your parents
they leave you or not?"

209
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,464
I said: 'No, they may not leave,
the baddhas of your parents.

210
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,544
Then what's the use
of leaving the parents?'

211
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,374
"But," I said:
'Who is leaving parents?"

212
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,374
"No," he said: "I've heard that
in the Western countries,

213
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:51,574
people, children
leave their parents

214
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,454
when they are
eighteen years of age.

215
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,534
But I would not
like to leave the parents."

216
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:58,414
I said: "Why?
You can be free."

217
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,604
He said: "Then, I'll be
free to do wrong.

218
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,524
Who will correct me?

219
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,484
If I take the cigarette
in my hand,

220
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:05,644
who will correct me?

221
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,444
Who will tell me:
"Don't do it."

222
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,684
I mean if a child takes
a cigarette in the hand,

223
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,644
immediately the father
will take the cigarette

224
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:14,324
and burn it, also.

225
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,594
And: "Next time I see you
I'll burn your tongue."

226
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,314
Finished.

227
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:24,354
But, the child knows that,
"The father loves me

228
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,354
and loves me in such a way

229
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,394
that I should not lose my father",

230
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,344
but he must know that he can lose,

231
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,344
the kindness of the father.

232
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:36,344
If you allow the child
just all the time

233
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,464
to behave the way
he likes, or it likes,

234
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,624
then it will sit on your head.

235
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:44,464
And today only I was
discussing with him

236
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:47,494
and I told him that I was
traveling one day with one lady

237
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,334
in the train, one of
the Sahaja Yoginis,

238
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,494
and her child was
there, not very old,

239
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,614
must have been about
seven years of age.

240
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:58,414
She was trying to talk
to Me and this fellow

241
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:00,644
was all the time:
"Mummy, mummy,"

242
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:04,364
and then: "Why? Why?"
was going on,

243
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,564
you see, all the time.

244
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:09,564
I told her: "Why must you
answer all his questions?"

245
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,444
I said: "He is just
making enquiries."

246
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:15,554
I said, "Nothing sensible
enquiries, just it's nonsense.

247
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:17,514
He wants to attract
your attention."

248
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:20,354
So why do you want to pay
so much attention to him?

249
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,474
So she said: "Mother, how to stop it?"

250
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,394
I said: "I'll stop it in one minute."

251
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,594
I said, I asked him:

252
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,594
"You should not ask
so many questions."

253
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,544
So he said: "Why?"

254
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,384
"Because", I said,
"you are stupid.

255
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:35,624
You have to learn a lot, still

256
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,584
and if you go on asking
question like this

257
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,384
you'll be very, very stupid

258
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,304
and one day you'll have
to go like a madman.

259
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,584
Do you want to become a madman?"

260
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:47,454
He got a fright of his life.

261
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:48,494
"You'll become mad."

262
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,334
And you see if you any
of your children are there

263
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,374
you have to tell them
some stories. I'll tell you how.

264
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:56,374
Some children have
a habit of beating others

265
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,294
or doing something, then you said,

266
00:11:58,294 --> 00:12:03,324
"Now if you beat then a tail
comes out of your bottom,

267
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:06,564
like that you see like a doggy
and something like that."

268
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:09,244
And they believe it.
They believe it.

269
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,564
Next day they'll ask:
"Is there a tail coming out?"

270
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:17,434
"Ya maybe, maybe."

271
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:20,314
So now you are going to
behave: "Ya I'll be very..."

272
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:23,274
You see all these tricks have
to be played to your children

273
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,434
but they're very clever

274
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,474
and they knowhow
to make you dance,

275
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:29,474
you see how to make you

276
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:35,424
- their sort of slaves,
sometimes, you may call

277
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:38,224
for everything they
will demand: "Do this, do this."

278
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,224
Now because they're Realized souls

279
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,264
I was surprised that when
I went to London you see

280
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:46,414
I read in the newspaper
the statistics about children

281
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:49,534
that every week in London City only,

282
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:51,574
two children are killed by parents.

283
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:53,494
I mean that was too much for Me.

284
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:56,374
So I just blasted all
of them and I said:

285
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,334
"Nothing doing, you must
love your children."

286
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,364
As a result all the children
sat on their heads, you see

287
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,484
and they couldn't come
to the programs.

288
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,444
If they came to the
programs they were,

289
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:08,204
the children were to be
kept outside like doggies,

290
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,524
tied together something and
in England I don't know,

291
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,524
maybe here also, they do
have a leash, just like a dog.

292
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,394
You see they hold the
children just like... I said,

293
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,314
"How cruel it is",

294
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,234
but now I know how children
can be in the West.

295
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,354
I don't know if it's white skin
or whatever you may say

296
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:27,434
that first we started
a school you see, for them,

297
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:30,274
because there was
no school available,

298
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,424
they were in a mess.

299
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:35,264
So we said, "All right in Dharamshala
we'll start a school."

300
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:37,464
So we started
a school in Dharamshala

301
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,424
and these children were brought

302
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,544
because they had no way
to go anywhere

303
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,544
so in a hurry it was
started, you see.

304
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:46,334
So there must be something
also if you

305
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,334
just start a school in a great hurry

306
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,254
maybe some things are left out.

307
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,214
But these children were terrible

308
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,334
because they saw these
teachers were Indians

309
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,414
so they came and
started punching them,

310
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:59,174
they started showing
tongue to them,

311
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,454
sometimes spitting
at them, sometimes

312
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:05,364
- pinching and doing all
kinds of things, you know.

313
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,284
So the teachers got a fright.

314
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,164
They said: "Baba, we can't
look after these bounders,

315
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:12,524
God knows what they are up to.

316
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,444
One day they'll bring a knife
and push it through us.

317
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:17,394
We don't know what to do."

318
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:20,194
And we have very bad
experience in Shudy Camp

319
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,434
about these children

320
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,274
that they had no sense
of proportion, nothing.

321
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:26,434
They were not cautious at all and

322
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:29,314
then I said: 'What will you do?

323
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,344
"They have already started jumping,"

324
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,224
they said, "from different places."

325
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,304
I hope they are not
jumping there.

326
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,344
So... and one boy broke his leg.

327
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,224
They got a fright.

328
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,494
So I said: 'All right now
you do one thing.

329
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,334
They are already spoilt

330
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:52,374
but take one foot-rule, ruler,

331
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,294
and keep it and say that

332
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,334
"If you misbehave this is the thing."

333
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,414
And once or twice just do
a little bit like that."

334
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:01,324
Now that doesn't mean you
go on beating your children.

335
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:06,124
I mean everything should
not be taken to an extreme,

336
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:07,484
but there should be a balance.

337
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:09,244
Must understand.

338
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:12,364
So there was one boy
who had come as a cook

339
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:15,364
from Austria and Yogi had asked him,

340
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,234
he thought that he is a Westerner -

341
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,474
"You'd better look after the children."

342
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,154
He started thrashing
them, left and right.

343
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:23,314
Not the Indian women.

344
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:25,194
Indian women don't
thrash so much,

345
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,154
you see we don't
beat. I mean I have

346
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,194
slapped My daughter
once, one daughter,

347
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:33,224
elder one and younger
one twice in their lifetime.

348
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,184
We don't believe in thrashing,

349
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,304
but you see they're
afraid of our eyes,

350
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:42,910
even they know what
we want, what is good.

351
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,134
I'll tell you My younger
daughter she,

352
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:48,374
when she went to college
in Delhi she found

353
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:51,134
all the girls were wearing
sleeveless blouses.

354
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:52,334
So she came and asked Me,

355
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,214
Should I wear sleeveless blouses?

356
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:58,094
because all the girls are
wearing sleeveless blouses?"

357
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,334
I said, "Go ahead if you think so."

358
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,404
She said, "Mummy why don't
you wear sleeveless blouse?"

359
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,364
I said, "I feel shy when
I've worn it;

360
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:10,364
I don't like to expose
My hands like that,

361
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,284
I don't like it, it's not good.

362
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:15,284
The arms, you see, should
be covered, I think."

363
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,154
Immediately she said,

364
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:20,394
"Then it is no criteria if I say

365
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,434
I want this and all that you
should say yes to everything.

366
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,194
You should have said, 'No,

367
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,154
no', to me. I would have
been very happy."

368
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,354
So this wisdom is there in,
among Indian children.

369
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:32,344
They like - like Avadut,
as I told you,

370
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:34,344
he said that, "Then
who will correct me,

371
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:36,264
who will stop me
from doing wrong?"

372
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:38,344
But that's not with
our children here,

373
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,104
so you see because,
I don't know why,

374
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:44,064
but maybe that our roots
are too deep or whatever it is

375
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,094
we have to keep controlled
all the time

376
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:47,374
and wisdom is very important.

377
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,174
If you tell a child, "You have
been very unmannerly," -

378
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:54,294
I mean, it's like saying the
horridest thing to a child,

379
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:55,414
"you're unmannerly."

380
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:57,414
Or to say, "You are very unwise";

381
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:00,134
then the child feels very hurt.

382
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,284
"I'm unwise, I've not been seeing."

383
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,244
But the best thing would be to say,

384
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:06,244
"You are Sahaja Yogis,
you are special people,

385
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,404
you can't do like that,
you are Sahaja Yogis."

386
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:11,084
All the time go on telling them

387
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:13,124
how dignified they should be,

388
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:16,074
what is expected of
a Sahaja Yogi, it is better.

389
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:18,234
But never spoil them.

390
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,194
This is one thing you should
not do otherwise it will be

391
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:23,114
a permanent headache for you,

392
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,354
even if they are Realized souls
whatever they may be.

393
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,314
But please see that
you do not spoil them.

394
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:30,114
That's very important.

395
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,144
Also as I told you that,

396
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:35,184
"Don't talk ill of each
other, on the back."

397
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,104
Is a very bad habit,

398
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,184
that's how you'll catch on bhoots

399
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,304
and you'll become extremely negative.

400
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:45,224
Any such thought comes into
your mind, just stop it.

401
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:52,174
It's a very, nasty disease
you see that spreads,

402
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:55,334
so it makes you - I mean, it's
so sickening you know,

403
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:57,134
when I mean I hear
about somebody

404
00:17:57,134 --> 00:18:00,254
who talks ill of someone
it's extremely sickening

405
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:04,324
because it's not being human.

406
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,324
You see in the animal, there's
one animal called hyena.

407
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,124
And they say this
hyena is like that.

408
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:15,044
It comes slowly and steals
a child, or anything,

409
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:18,354
it's a very, sly type of an animal

410
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:22,154
and such a person we call
as hyena in India,

411
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:24,194
such a person is called as a hyena

412
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:29,114
and it's regarded as a very
low type of a personality,

413
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:31,184
if they talk like this.

414
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,184
In Sahaja Yoga it doesn't behove.

415
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:36,344
No Sahaja Yogis should
talk ill about each other.

416
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:41,144
Nor should they discuss each other.

417
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:43,064
Never!

418
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:46,294
Now somebody does that
you must immediately say:

419
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,214
"Now, please I don't want to know.

420
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:52,014
Please don't tell me."

421
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:54,254
This is not a very good thing.

422
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:58,334
Politicians do like that,
but not Sahaja Yogis.

423
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,084
Sahaja Yogis should not do,

424
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:04,124
because, you see you are
great people, you are yogis.

425
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:06,284
Do you know how a yogi becomes

426
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:10,284
a Realized soul, in the normal way?

427
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,084
The other day I was reading a book

428
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:17,114
about Upanishadas and
one of them was - today

429
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,114
only I saw it in the morning
time when I got up.

430
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:22,954
There was written about a yogi

431
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:26,114
that,

432
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:31,064
"You have to really starve
yourself, first of all.

433
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:33,984
Then you have to do shirshasana,

434
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,184
with that you have to do pranayama,

435
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:41,024
then you have to get up four
o'clock in the morning

436
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,064
and take your bath,

437
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:45,184
and then sit down for dhyana,

438
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,174
and for five hours you must
sit for your dhyana.

439
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:51,974
After that you have
to do pranayama.

440
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:53,174
That's also special style.

441
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:55,254
It's not easy for normal
person to do that

442
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:59,934
is till you say sixty you
raise your left side,

443
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:03,924
take the prana through your,

444
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,924
I mean you breathe through
your nostril left one,

445
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:10,084
now sixty-four you
say keep it here,

446
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:16,074
and then rechaka: you do the
taking it out thirty-two  times,

447
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,274
can you imagine?

448
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:21,074
This you have to do 108 times,
every day,

449
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,994
minimum. This is the minimum."

450
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,074
Now there are so many exercises,

451
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:28,114
if I tell you that, you'll
be shocked.

452
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:30,274
So like,

453
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,264
you have to stand
and suddenly jump

454
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,944
and put your both the
feet five feet apart   imagine

455
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,104
Then turn round,

456
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,184
to clear your nadis you see,

457
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:46,094
you have to turn round

458
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:49,014
and put yourself on the left side.

459
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,054
Now on the left side you put yourself

460
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,134
and it's quite a big thing
that they have described

461
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,174
but in short it's
a stretching exercise,

462
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:58,974
and you put your
hand on the left side

463
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:01,014
and go down stretch yourself,

464
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,124
again go back to normal,

465
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:04,924
again jump and go five feet apart.

466
00:21:04,924 --> 00:21:06,884
Then put to the right side.

467
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:08,924
Nadi cleansing is this way.

468
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,924
But there are so many
others described you see.

469
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:13,084
They are so horrible.

470
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:16,084
They said ordinary exercises
for ordinary people,

471
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,874
but for a person who
wants to achieve yoga,

472
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:22,154
he has to do all these
horrible exercises

473
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,994
are I don't know, I mean,

474
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,034
by that time all your
body will be broken

475
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,874
the way it is or in any case
you'll get moksha you see.

476
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:32,144
It's like that.

477
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:34,144
But what I'm trying
to tell you is this

478
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:36,184
that now you've got everything simple

479
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:40,024
- easy this thing, but in
a subtle way

480
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:43,944
still all these nonsensical
things are sticking on,

481
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,934
and even if you are in the boat now,

482
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,054
still it is there and they are
creating a heavy weight,

483
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,054
and this heavy weight can really

484
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,134
take you down again,

485
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:59,054
and when you go down
after a certain height,

486
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,054
you go down very fast.

487
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:04,084
So many people we have
thrown out of Sahaja Yoga,

488
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,204
so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

489
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,884
so many have come into Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:10,924
Now the people who have
come in the beginning,

491
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,964
are excused for some time

492
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,164
and also they see you
how you behave,

493
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:16,994
it's very important.

494
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:20,074
So first thing we must
know that we are people

495
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:22,194
who are Sahaja Yogis
special type of people,

496
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,074
specially placed

497
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:26,954
and we have so many privileges

498
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,154
so we have to be extremely dignified.

499
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,864
I've seen people just will
laugh for nothing at all.

500
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,904
In a group, you are there,

501
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,824
they just start laughing.

502
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:37,904
There's no need to laugh

503
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:39,144
but they'll just start laughing.

504
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:42,944
Even if I am sitting they'll
just go on chatting

505
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,864
and talking and, see no sense at all.

506
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,894
But if your Guru is sitting there
you have to keep quiet,

507
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:50,134
you have to be humble,

508
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,094
you have to have awe.

509
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:54,054
All these things are important

510
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:56,014
which we have to gradually learn,

511
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:58,134
because you have never had a proper

512
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,844
training about spiritual life.

513
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:04,844
You see what these churches
or you can say

514
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:06,884
these temples that you have seen or

515
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:09,044
anything else that you
have got those,

516
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:13,844
you see have not been
real masters to tell you

517
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,164
how to behave, how to address,

518
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:17,874
how to be there.

519
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:21,034
So, now, gradually you
should see for yourself

520
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:23,874
that you have to grow,
and grow very fast

521
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:26,794
and for that you have to remember

522
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,954
we must need our introspection,
to see: 'Where am I?

523
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:32,104
Now what am I doing?

524
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:34,864
Ah, now the anger is coming.'

525
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,104
As soon as the anger starts coming

526
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,944
go and stand before
your mirror and say:

527
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:40,784
'Now come along let's get angry.'

528
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:45,904
You face yourself all the
time and it will help.

529
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,134
Not the others.

530
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:50,934
Now I have to tell you that
whenever you find

531
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,014
such people coming up
they will form a group,

532
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:57,774
then a group can become
bigger or absolutely small,

533
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:59,014
depending on you.

534
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:00,054
You have to just say:

535
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,924
'Mother has said not to listen
a word against anyone.

536
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:05,124
Just not to listen.

537
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,924
And in the beginning of course it is,

538
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,764
quite a lot has to be tolerated.

539
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,044
Like I've seen if you see
the letters written to Me

540
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,764
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

541
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:17,914
they are so maddening.

542
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,954
This person talking ill about that,

543
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,794
that person talking ill about that,

544
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,954
I mean, anybody would
be mad to read all that.

545
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,754
So I never read them.

546
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,994
All these letters I used to just burn away.

547
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,744
But luckily now these
people have become

548
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,864
extremely sensible,

549
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:34,744
they understand their responsibility,

550
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:36,904
they have become very,
very beautiful people,

551
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:38,744
very understanding,

552
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,904
and the love that they
have for each other,

553
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:42,744
it's very interesting.

554
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:45,944
Only in love you can know
about others, not in hatred.

555
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,734
If you hate someone how will
you know about that person,

556
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:49,974
the beauty of that person?

557
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,774
So then you start seeing
the beauty of that person

558
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:54,774
and you start enjoying that person.

559
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:56,774
This is what Sahaja Yoga is.

560
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:01,094
So I would like you to see
that you train your children

561
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:06,884
in such a manner that they
feel their responsibilities

562
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,789
as Sahaja Yogis.

563
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:13,804
May God bless you!

564
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,554
Better be on the lookout,
there’s smaller children also.
