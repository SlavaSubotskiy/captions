1
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:08,839
Now how do you do it in Sahaja Yoga?

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,923
As you have the photograph you may use it.

3
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,840
Put a light before the photograph.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,131
Light is the way you cure your Agnya Chakra.

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:21,507
Always. Light or the sun. Because Christ resides in the sun.

6
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:25,173
So what you do, is to put a light in front.

7
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:31,298
Take another light behind and give an Aarti to your Agnya Chakra

8
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:40,090
at the back. It is resided by Maha Ganapati and Maha Bhairava.

9
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:44,923
So you just give it an Aarti and Agnya Chakra will open.

10
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:48,965
But how do you open this ? Very simple thing is that,

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,590
any thought comes to you, you should say 'I forgive'.

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,632
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us.

13
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,674
You just say 'I forgive, I forgive',

14
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,048
and you can overcome your ego.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,340
This is the mantra for this Chakra in the front,

16
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:05,340
where you just say 'I forgive, I forgive, I forgive'

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,839
and you will find your Agnya Chakra will open out

18
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:10,230
and you will find your ego will go away.

19
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:13,965
Forgiveness is one of the 'biggest' weapons human beings have got.

20
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,923
But they are so stupid if I tell them 'Forgive.

21
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:21,287
Now what is there not to forgive ?'
They say it is very difficult to forgive.

22
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,967
I say what is so difficult ? What are you doing ?

23
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:26,090
Are you doing something when you are saying,

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,757
I am forgiving. Do you do something ? Nothing.

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,757
On the contrary when you do not forgive,

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,340
then what is happening is, the person whom you do not forgive,

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,382
is actually torturing you, while you are not torturing that person.

28
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:44,173
So this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front,

29
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:47,590
and at the back, as I told you, you have to move the Light.

30
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:50,131
Now somebody will, you see, one day they will do,

31
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:53,686
two days they will do, - that is not how the Sahaja yoga is to be worked out.

32
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,560
You have to really go all out to do it,

33
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,923
and I have seen people who had eyes which were all bent like this,

34
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:01,340
they could never raise their eyes, are now,

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,799
have open eyes, proper eyes with this working.

36
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,006
It is 'very' simple to be done.

37
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,507
There is one more thing that happens to our eyes.

38
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:13,632
When the Swadishthana Chakra goes out of order.

39
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,632
It is represented here at the back,

40
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:20,632
which is 'around' this back Agnya.

41
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,507
So when you have diabetes or anything like that,

42
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:28,131
people start becoming blind. Because this Swadishthana Chakra

43
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:32,048
which is around, goes on pressing it and that is how,

44
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:40,340
that part which is surrounding this center, oppresses

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,090
and augments that centre, so that the eyes cannot see;

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,340
there is no light. There is darkness and people have eyes open.

47
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:54,006
You have seen many diabetic people get this blindness.

48
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:59,590
So first of all cure your diabetes through curing your Swadishthana.

49
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:11,257
And also you can use an ice around your Swadishthana at the back.

50
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,131
But first of all if you improve your Swadishthana

51
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,131
you will feel very much better.

52
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:23,048
So the treatment of the front side is with the light.

53
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,048
And the treatment of the back is with the water.

54
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:32,923
But the best is also to use the light or the water

55
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:35,715
whichever way you like. Because if it is Swadishthana

56
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:40,507
you have to use the water but if it is 'just' the possession,

57
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:44,298
then you have to use - without diabetes, if it is a possession --

58
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,507
then you have to just use the light.

59
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:50,298
That is how we cure our Agnya Chakra.
