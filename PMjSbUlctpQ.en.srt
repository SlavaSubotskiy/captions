1
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:27,792
So today is Dassera, is a 
very big day in India.

2
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:32,375
They say on this day 
Ravana was killed.

3
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,999
He was the worst enemy 
of human beings,

4
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,792
and he was killed.

5
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,667
But whatever 
it is then,

6
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:46,959
as a memory

7
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,458
of that great man,

8
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:56,542
Shri Ram, they celebrate 
today Dassera.

9
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:01,375
And on this day, 
they say

10
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,667
those who are dushtas 
means "bad people"

11
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:11,333
or we can say negative, 
they are killed.

12
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,999
Can you imagine?

13
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:20,375
So this day is regarded as 
a very important day in India,

14
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:28,792
and they make a big 
statue of Ravana.

15
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,917
You all know who 
was Ravana?

16
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,250
Yes, Shri Mataji.

17
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,333
Whom Shri Rama 
killed?

18
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,875
He was a horrible 
fellow,

19
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,834
and he took away 
the wife of Shri Ram.

20
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,458
Sita, by force.

21
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,999
But she was such 
a chaste woman

22
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,166
that he couldn't 
touch her.

23
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,750
He tried, he couldn't 
touch her.

24
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,750
He couldn´t achieve 
any power over her.

25
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,834
On the contrary she 
was very powerful.

26
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,625
So

27
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,834
at that time 
Shri Rama's

28
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,166
mother-in-law, 
I should say,

29
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,875
who was the wife 
of Dasharatha,

30
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,500
she said,

31
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,083
she used to ...

32
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,208
she is like 
a big "saadhuni".

33
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:05,083
And she said that, 
from today

34
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,750
two marriages are not 
allowed, only one.

35
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,166
So among Hindus there 
is only one marriage.

36
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,792
They don't have 
two marriages

37
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,917
and regard it 
as very sinful

38
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,458
to have another 
woman,

39
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,583
according to Indian 
culture.

40
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,250
There are some 
people who do it,

41
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,875
but it is wrong, 
is not Indian.

42
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,959
The father-in-law 
passed a law,

43
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:52,709
because he has..he suffered... 
He had two wives

44
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:59,041
and one of them tried 
to send Shri Ram

45
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,583
to the jungle.

46
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,083
She was so cruel,

47
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,834
because she 
wanted her son

48
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,125
to become the king

49
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:17,166
and as it was the mistake 
of the father

50
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,583
that he had promised

51
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:25,417
that he will 
give her

52
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,375
a boon

53
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,375
because she had 
saved him in war.

54
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,750
And so now

55
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,709
she asked him 
to send Shri Ram,

56
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:50,041
to the "vanavas" 
- to the jungle.

57
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:57,542
By second one, 
she asked

58
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:01,875
to give the kingdom 
to her son,

59
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,999
who was Lakshmana,

60
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,125
but when Lakshmana came 
he didn't want.

61
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,041
He said: "I don't want to 
take Shri Rama's

62
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,500
seat because 
it is his right."

63
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:23,542
So he went to Shri Ram 
in the jungle,

64
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:27,458
requested him: 
"You must come,

65
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:34,041
you must come to Ajodhya 
to the capital city

66
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,542
and you should 
be crowned."

67
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,667
Shri Ram said: 
"I can't do it.

68
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:45,041
I have to fulfil my 
father's wish."

69
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,291
But at that moment,

70
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:54,834
the father said 
that in India

71
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,999
nobody will have 
second marriage.

72
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Because of two wives 
the whole family suffered,

73
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,417
so he said: "Only we 
can have one wife

74
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,208
and no two wives."

75
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,500
Very surprising 
that even till today

76
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:21,250
in India they believe that you 
should have only one wife.

77
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,417
But what you find 
in other countries

78
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,709
that people may not 
have another wife

79
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,083
but they have affairs

80
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,500
and they do not 
respect their wives.

81
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,834
This is very sad

82
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:48,083
and this makes 
the country suffering,

83
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,250
because if the women 
are treated like that,

84
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,999
the women suffer

85
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,166
and if the mother suffers, 
the children suffer.

86
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,166
So he made a law

87
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,999
that nobody 
will marry twice.

88
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,041
Only Mohammed Sahib 
said: "All right,

89
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,375
we can have 
four marriages",

90
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,250
because

91
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,792
there was so 
much killing,

92
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:31,000
and so few 
men were left.

93
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:37,750
Many women and 
very few men.

94
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:43,500
So he said that: "All right, you 
can have four wives each

95
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,458
solve the problem."

96
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,333
He does not, he does 
not solve the problem!

97
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,750
Even the Muslims 
now have this problem.

98
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,875
They marry four 
times, no doubt,

99
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:05,625
but if you see their family 
life, they are very sad.

100
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:11,667
We Indians should not 
learn anything from them.

101
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,291
On the contrary, we have 
to tell the whole world

102
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,999
that - don´t run 
after women.

103
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,875
Look after yourself.

104
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,500
Which is...

105
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:33,083
in the West people 
have no sense.

106
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:38,583
They have one wife, of course 
they don´t have two wives,

107
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,291
but they carry on

108
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,875
with another woman.

109
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:52,917
In Sahaja yoga 
it is banned

110
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,375
to do these things,

111
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:01,250
and if they do it like that, 
I tell them that you divorce

112
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,208
and then I arrange 
their marriages.

113
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,166
But very sad

114
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,375
because why should they, under 
the influence of western life,

115
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,166
try to have 
another wife

116
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,834
and make to whole 
thing so polluted.

117
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,917
Their children suffer, 
mainly.

118
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,709
If the morality of the 
place is not good

119
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,375
the new generation, 
the children, they suffer.

120
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:45,999
And what do we have 
is a sick country.

121
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,709
English were, 
once upon a time,

122
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:58,667
very proud and 
very sensible.

123
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,542
But now

124
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,999
they become 
very unhappy.

125
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,959
because they don´t 
believe in one wife.

126
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,208
They´ll have one wife at home and 
another wife somewhere else,

127
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,792
and this is 
a very sad thing.

128
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:22,834
In Sahaja yoga we 
do not tolerate it.

129
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:29,917
You have to have one wife and 
you have to live with one wife.

130
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,709
Some women are 
obstinate - all right I say,

131
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,542
you can leave 
Sahaja yoga.

132
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,667
And some men are 
also very troublesome,

133
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,000
so I tell them you 
leave Sahaja yoga.

134
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,500
If you want to have 
the advantage

135
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,208
of being Sahaja yogi

136
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:54,083
then you cannot 
marry another woman

137
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,542
or another man.

138
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,667
You have to lead a happy 
life with each other.

139
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:07,417
If you can´t do it, then you 
get out of Sahaja yoga.

140
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,542
But there are some people 
who had horrible times

141
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,792
with their wives 
or husbands

142
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,709
so what I have 
said that: "All right

143
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,291
those who are

144
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:29,792
flirting and are not having 
a proper personality,

145
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,041
they can't be in 
a Sahaja yoga."

146
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:37,750
We have to make 
a very pure society,

147
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:43,500
our duty is to show that 
we can live happily

148
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,999
without fighting.

149
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:53,500
And the Sahaja yogis are known 
to be very sensible husbands.

150
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,917
I am very happy 
to see you all here,

151
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:02,583
I know some of them, 
I have married them,

152
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,583
and they are 
very happy.

153
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,542
So I have to tell all of 
you, men and women,

154
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,166
that we have to lead 
a dedicated life.

155
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:28,834
If the husband is flirting, 
let him go to the hell

156
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,291
or if the wife is flirting 
let her go to hell.

157
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,166
We are Sahaja yogis, and we have 
to keep our characters good.

158
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,792
If you have 
a good character,

159
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,291
you enjoy life 
of your own.

160
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:53,041
If you have 
a frivolous life

161
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
you can never 
enjoy.

162
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,583
You go running after 
this one and that one.

163
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,333
Such people can 
never be happy

164
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:09,542
and they do all kinds of 
nonsense and waste their lives.

165
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,999
But by the 
time they die

166
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,250
their condition 
is so bad,

167
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,917
very bad,

168
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,999
such people 
suffer a lot.

169
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,667
I have seen 
them suffering,

170
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:30,083
suffering so badly.

171
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:35,709
So we are husband and 
wife to enjoy each other

172
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:41,917
and to lead a happy life, 
not to become miserable.

173
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,792
All of you now 
married in Sahaja yoga

174
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,999
maybe some of 
you - haven´t tested

175
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,875
a good married life

176
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:02,417
but what to do? That´s not 
the mistake with Sahaja yoga,

177
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:08,000
it is a mistake 
with you, yourself,

178
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,917
and mistake 
with your wife.

179
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,999
So everybody must 
stand up on their right

180
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,125
and lead 
the right life

181
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,083
instead of wasting 
energy

182
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,667
over quarrelling 
and fighting.

183
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:33,667
Try to find out, why do you 
quarrel and why do you fight,

184
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:38,875
on what points there 
are differences.

185
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:43,542
There has to be difference, 
doesn’t matter.

186
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,959
After all, you 
are two persons,

187
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,750
there has to be 
differences,

188
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:55,417
but difference should 
not create problem.

189
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:59,834
On the contrary you must 
enjoy the difference,

190
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,583
as long as, you aren't 
a dedicated wife

191
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:09,999
and you aren't a dedicated husband, 
you can never enjoy life.

192
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,875
All the time you will 
be worried and upset.

193
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:19,500
So all of you I thank 
you very much,

194
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,750
that on such a great auspicious 
day you all have come.

195
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,333
And all look 
very happy.

196
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,500
Thank you very much.
