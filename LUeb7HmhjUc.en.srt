1
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:15,176
What is Sahajyog?

2
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,000
Sahajyog!

3
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:25,630
'Saha' means with you and 'ja 'means born.

4
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:38,780
'Yog' means your attention's union with

5
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:45,732
God 's power of love that is spread all around.

6
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,299
This occurance itself is called 'yog'.

7
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:55,881
This is the birth right of every human being.

8
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:06,143
To get it , as the other meaning of 'Sahaj" is easy, spontanious.

9
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:12,291
For this, there is proper arrangement within us.

10
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:18,486
There is nobody within whom there is no such arrangement

11
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,010
means within your triangular bone

12
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,334
which is called 'Sacrum' in English language

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:34,567
It means that Greeks knew that

14
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:43,390
the traingular bone is sacred, means it is pure.

15
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:47,034
That is why its name is 'Sacrum' since eternity.

16
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:52,561
Now this bone

17
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,331
In this traingular bone

18
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,934
three and half circles

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:06,192
the power that is inherent in it, is called Kundalini in Sanskrit.

20
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,130
Within us God has bestowed three more powers too.

21
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:27,644
One of those powers is that we desire.

22
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,017
Our power of desire, our everyday work of the power of desire.

23
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,751
And another is our power of action.

24
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:41,920
This nourishes our sympathetic nervous system.

25
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:48,985
Its nourishment depends upon these two chakras.

26
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:55,336
First power, with the help of which we desire

27
00:02:55,361 --> 00:03:04,180
the channel through which that power is broadcasted

28
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:07,725
is called Ida Nadi.

29
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,921
And the other power that gets activated

30
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:15,655
they do the work for the desire they have

31
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:21,257
with their existence and their body

32
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:26,197
that power which we can say is

33
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,254
our right sympathetic nervous system.

34
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,700
But its name is Pingala Nadi.

35
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:36,673
In this way , there are two channels within us.

36
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,980
Ida and Pingla Nadi.

37
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:44,300
Apart from these there is third channel within us.

38
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,000
This is called Sushumna, which is in the center

39
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,171
is called MADHYA MARG.

40
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:55,129
Both these powers come from left and right and join like this.

41
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,645
And in the center a chakra is made

42
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,728
(Showing with HER hands)

43
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,307
within the central chakras

44
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:15,709
our physical, mental, intellectual, cultural

45
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:24,098
even our spiritual, all progress is settled.

46
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,495
When these chakras

47
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:36,553
get damaged on some account, or their power recedes and is destroyed

48
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:40,354
then we face so many types of degeneration,

49
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:46,346
physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual.

50
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:53,141
This which is built within us is like

51
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,932
a great subtle TANTRA (mechanism).

52
00:04:56,957 --> 00:05:00,301
but the difference between Tantricks and us is that

53
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:06,816
Tantricks don't know anything about this mechanism and falsely

54
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,783
they say that they are Tantricks and say 'we do this , we do that'.

55
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:17,596
But mostly Tantricks use Bhoot Vidya.

56
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,709
And they messmerize people with that Bhoot Vidya

57
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:26,025
The same vidya (Knowkedge)

58
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,487
that we call Pret Vidya, Mashan Vidya etc., there are so many names.

59
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:37,116
Now the powers that are within us

60
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:40,953
apart from that there is fourth power within us.

61
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:48,425
Till we were not human beings, this fourth power did not evolve.

62
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,883
Till then these three powers were implemented

63
00:05:53,967 --> 00:06:00,806
and whatever our progress was going on

64
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:03,384
we should say that in our evolution

65
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:11,379
was fully going on  with the help of these three powers.

66
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:16,343
For example, first power is 'power of desire'

67
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,429
second is 'power of action'.

68
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,736
And the third power is which we can say

69
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,323
is the cordination of the two

70
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,463
or balance or we can say is the middle path.

71
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:37,796
By and by, a human being has reached this state

72
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:44,299
that he in this Kaliyuga is in hassle.

73
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:52,569
Sometimes he follows a wrong path, acts wrongly

74
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:57,396
and in a way destroys himself completely.

75
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,263
Secondly, he behaves in such a manner

76
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,826
that he becomes very wicked, is full of ego

77
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,464
and is very agressive with the people.

78
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:08,386
Its example is

79
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:15,387
let us try to understand that by following both the paths

80
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:20,866
we feel that we are progressing.

81
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:27,300
What is wrong with this, it is good, it is freedom for us.

82
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:31,556
But it is different to know the TANTRA Of (SAV)

83
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,930
We are talking here about TANTRA of (SAV)

84
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,212
First of all, it should be understood

85
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:45,847
that if we knew only truth, knew absolute truth

86
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:47,744
there would have been no disputes of the present.

87
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:52,262
So, something else should be within us

88
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:57,881
and because of which we will come to know that

89
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,353
which is only'Truth'.

90
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:06,287
After knowing all this, they will accept one thing

91
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:11,626
because within them they have felt only ' Truth.'

92
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:15,292
Now for awakening the kundalini

93
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:20,315
for the last so many years Nagpanthis did a lot of work.

94
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:27,209
In this work of Nagpanthis, there was a system, a tradition

95
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:32,284
that one guru would awaken only one disciple.

96
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,707
and would work only for one disciple

97
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:38,923
And sometimes these disciples would follow the wrong path

98
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:42,509
and would not follow their advice.

99
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,338
According to ME, in the twelfth century

100
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:54,653
for the first time, Gyaneshwar ji wrote about kundalini

101
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:59,090
in his commentary about Geeta.

102
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:04,940
In sixth chapter, has openly said

103
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:07,050
as we should say, keeping in mind the conditions of that age

104
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,917
had openly said in that period.

105
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,547
when religious practitioners said

106
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:14,491
it has not been prooved and so don't read it.

107
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:18,700
Before that Markandey Swamy, Adi Shankaracharya

108
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,170
who had come in sixth century

109
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,551
told about Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

110
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:26,355
But common man didn't know him.

111
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,384
Secondly, which means that

112
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,646
when only one person will work with one disciple

113
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,409
it would spread among the ordinary people.

114
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,428
After that there were many religions in the world.

115
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:44,467
and spread also too much.

116
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:49,535
But without Kundalini awakening, no dharma gets success

117
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:54,801
because whatever dharma a human being does, that is just external.

118
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,662
Every type of equipment

119
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,971
every type of, we should say

120
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:05,688
which results in too much ritualism

121
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,945
and because of that ritualism,

122
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:12,997
a human being does not get benefitted in anyway from religion.

123
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:15,661
That is why we find that now a days

124
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:18,496
a human being has some assumtions about dharma.

125
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,640
One will say i am Christian, another will say i am Muslim.

126
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,155
Now, Christian and Muslim religions are very rigid.

127
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:30,154
Because in Christian religion, Christ has written

128
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:37,537
that if your one eye does any wrong act, take it out

129
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:41,944
and if your one hand does a wrong act break it, cut it.

130
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:45,941
But I have not seen anyone doing so among Christians.

131
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,983
And Muslim religion is even more rigid than that.

132
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:53,848
They have put such restrictions even on women.

133
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,442
That those who are not ordinary human beings.

134
00:10:57,467 --> 00:11:05,601
They were, as if highly proficient for some God's angles.

135
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:10,366
The restrictions they had told about religion

136
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:13,324
only they can do and nobody else.

137
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:19,998
Then what it led to, was that within a human being

138
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,688
hypocricy evolved, a religious hypocrisy.

139
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:27,231
To awaken dharma inside, kundalini should be awakened.

140
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:31,404
It means that when dharma awakens within a human being

141
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,996
he becomes dharmic.

142
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,531
He doesn't have to be told.

143
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,394
The reason is that when kundalini awakens

144
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:45,122
your spirit comes into your attention.

145
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:52,381
In the same way, a human being does what is joy giving for him

146
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:55,470
is nutritous, is constructive for him

147
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:04,333
and whatever is destructible, is destrucive, (is given up).

148
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:09,248
Until the light of his spirit doesn't get awakened

149
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,720
they do all wrong acts.

150
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,284
It is not his fault.

151
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,048
If anyone walks or falls down in dark

152
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,204
he should not be blamed.

153
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,016
In the same way

154
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,192
within you, you should analyse first.

155
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:25,867
You might say that we belong to this religion

156
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,541
we belong to that religion

157
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:32,540
and you are fighting on that account, that is wrong.

158
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:41,871
All religions were beautiful flowers of one spiritual tree

159
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,205
which were plucked.

160
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,021
and after plucking say this is our flower, this is our flower

161
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,448
and so are fighting among themselves.

162
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:50,917
How can you fight in the name of God?

163
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:55,913
Because God is the giver of love, He is compassionate.

164
00:12:57,112 --> 00:13:02,477
God who is the ocean of love, people fight in His name.

165
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,510
It is not possibe.

166
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,787
Because they haven't known God as yet

167
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,946
haven't acquired His power as yet.

168
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:14,386
I have seen in Sahajyoga that

169
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,345
thousands of people together

170
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:28,366
get this power.

171
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,299
It is very surprising.

172
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,231
First of all, when I started this work

173
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,520
only with one woman started and after that

174
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,508
and twelve people got self realization.

175
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:55,180
When experience takes place

176
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,509
this all pervading power,

177
00:14:01,922 --> 00:14:10,392
this creation full of vibrations, is cool and very comforting power

178
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:14,490
which you on your fingers

179
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:22,295
can see, can know and feel.

180
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:27,436
and even on your palm.

181
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:33,355
Like this when Kundalini pierces six chakras

182
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,455
and comes out of Bramharandra

183
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,546
then its connection

184
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:43,967
its oneness with all around Divine power of love takes place.

185
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:49,386
Till you are not connected

186
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:58,193
how can you know what is God's power of love.

187
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:05,888
Now the time has come, there is something special

188
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:10,660
that so many people are in search of God are, in search of truth.

189
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,358
It has never been before.

190
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,567
and in that search when they experience it

191
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:25,076
and when they look at themselves, they are surprised

192
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:30,969
that i was such a drunkard yesterday, was doing this, was doing that

193
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:35,124
and all this of mine, whatever

194
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:44,347
was like an obligation, how did it drop off suddenly.

195
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:48,158
Means what was it that was left behind.

196
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:53,201
By and by, with this power, with the power of the spirit

197
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:59,140
you see , you yourself are very powerful.

198
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:03,627
and you see that with this power of the spirit

199
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,498
you can give light to others too.

200
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,710
I have seen that many people had stage fright

201
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,371
have now become great orators.

202
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:19,236
Those who didn't know how to write poetry, started writing poems.

203
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,801
Very great

204
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:30,415
singers, musicians, and many artists have reached great heights.

205
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:36,274
This I am telling you only about power of creativity.

206
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,851
But there are many powers within us, we are unaware of

207
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:40,939
and these execute

208
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:44,153
after getting enlightened in the light of the spirit.

209
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,371
We don't know ourselves.

210
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:51,661
Actually we say this is my hand, this is my nose, this is my head

211
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:56,271
this is my wisdom and this is my thought.

212
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:59,903
This 'mine, mine' that we say, who is this?

213
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:06,275
If it is asked, ' who am i' ? we don't have (any answer to it).

214
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:14,226
But you (INAUDIBLE)

215
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,752
and piercing the Bramharandra

216
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:24,529
this all over spread Divine power is available to you.

217
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:28,688
Even the spirit settled in your heart

218
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:31,473
gets enlightened in your attention.

219
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:38,990
Then you understand that i am not this body, wisdom, mind, ego.

220
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:42,707
I myself am pure spirit.

221
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:50,390
A very great secret, which remained hidden

222
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,655
gets exposed in front of you.

223
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,070
You don't know that you are the spirit.

224
00:17:56,095 --> 00:18:00,333
But when it takes place, its knowledge comes to you.

225
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,419
Now this word 'BODH' (knowledge) is very important.

226
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:05,200
This is Sanskrit word 'BODH'.

227
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,923
From ' Bodh' originated ' Buddh'.

228
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:17,054
Means that on your central nervous system, you can feel this power.

229
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:23,331
You can feel this power on your chakras.

230
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:27,689
You can feel other's chakras too on this

231
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:32,371
If you can correct your chakras, you can do other's too.

232
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,669
While sitting here, you can even know about

233
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:39,354
the chakras of one who has died or is living in some foreign land.

234
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,307
Everybody gets knowledge about chakras.

235
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,071
You on your fingers

236
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:49,130
can know about the problem a person is suffering from.

237
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,531
Everybody will say the same thing.

238
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,686
There is no discussion about it, no quarrel

239
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,816
because you have only truth.

240
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,521
And after knowing this

241
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,515
many people, one such person had come to tell ME today only

242
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:07,777
that his cancer got cured.

243
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,392
And I asked him, "what did you do?"

244
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:20,824
" Mother I did a little bit of Sahajyoga treatment of Cancer

245
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,198
then I was alright.

246
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,560
And everybody had told me that you will die

247
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:28,232
but i am completely cured.

248
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:34,413
But in this  ( INAUDIBLE)

249
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:39,578
and another quality is that you know it.

250
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,038
You know everything.

251
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:45,759
In Sahajyoga, there is no secret knowledge.

252
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:49,004
You know everything about Sahajyoga.

253
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,885
Whatever you want to know, you know.

254
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,659
First thing about truth is that you are pure Spirit.

255
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:04,702
Another truth is that all around us is an invisible subtle power.

256
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:08,337
It is God's love that activates.

257
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:10,488
Now we may call that by any name.

258
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,528
It is called 'Rooh' in Koran

259
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:18,339
In Bible it is called ' Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost'.

260
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:21,550
And you go through any religion

261
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:26,032
Chaitanya and Param Chatanya etc.,

262
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,541
many other things have been mentioned in our Shastras.

263
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:34,047
And if You go through Patanjali yoga

264
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:37,183
it is called Ritambara Pragya'

265
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:41,449
which changes seasons, which makes the flowers to bloom

266
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:46,134
and whatever the system of living work channel is there

267
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,351
everything that takes place, is this power.

268
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:52,419
You are at one with that power

269
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:55,110
and it works inside your being.

270
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:58,692
After that you start changing.

271
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,168
You life gets balanced

272
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:07,722
and you know everything on your finger tips, what is your problem.

273
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,983
For example, people will come and tell ME

274
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:11,438
" Mother my Agnya is catching."

275
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,722
It means that we are getting ego and please take it out.

276
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:19,197
But will anyone say," I have ego"?

277
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,301
Nobody will say!

278
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,021
But when this state comes, a human being introspects himself.

279
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:29,391
What problem i have, like that

280
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:32,794
and when this takes place, then in collectivity

281
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:37,869
in collectivity a lot of work is done.

282
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,932
In collectivity it so happens that

283
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:45,912
a new cycle starts.

284
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:50,252
Now the people in Russia too are self realised

285
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:54,280
In England too there are, in Japan too, they are everywhere.

286
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:58,318
and they all know one thing about themselves and about others

287
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,625
what is their problem and what problem we have.

288
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,270
and how it should be done.

289
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:07,158
All of them speak one language and that is of chakras

290
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:11,366
and in this way I can see a new era in front of ME.

291
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:14,089
And now you cannot pay any money for this.

292
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,378
It is worth understanding that

293
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,496
for any living work we canno pay any money.

294
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:25,763
if there is a seed, if we put it into soil

295
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,972
we do not pay any money to the soil.

296
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:31,678
In the same way , it is a living work

297
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:36,097
and for this living work, you don't have to pay anything

298
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,554
and if anyone asks for money

299
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,032
first of all try to understand that it is fraud.

300
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:45,698
In this I will say

301
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:47,671
that today we are human beings

302
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:49,512
for that whom did we pay any money?

303
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:57,893
So if we come from spiritual form, to whom have we to pay for that?

304
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:03,150
Yes it is correct that if you are booking a hall, pay money for that

305
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,512
or pay money for such a thing.

306
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:09,604
But if you want for all this work, no money for that.

307
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:11,802
But if a human being understands only this much

308
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:14,671
that it has no connection with money

309
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:18,874
and God doesn't know what is money or bank.

310
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,193
And when you understand this thing

311
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:26,208
mostly the wrong gurus who have evolved these days

312
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,442
they will be disposed off.

313
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:32,275
Now in religions also, religion is money oriented

314
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:36,442
Either he is power oriented

315
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,057
or he is money oriented

316
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,128
for everything you put so much money

317
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,330
that we will write a letter to God and HE will set right everything.

318
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:50,741
In this way we, at a very low level, talk in the name of God.

319
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:54,608
I am so happy that today people

320
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,496
were blessed and got relaxed.

321
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:02,496
About Sahajyoga, if you want to understand

322
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,319
you have to experience it

323
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,799
If you have not experienced it

324
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,625
just make you understand like that

325
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,406
may be you will think that SHE is talking just miraculously.

326
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:17,101
Don't know if it is true or not.

327
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,478
So first of all it should be experienced.

328
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,692
This is very important.

329
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,553
After experiencing it

330
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:27,307
like a sprouted seed, it grows slowly

331
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,659
in the same way, a Sahajyogi becomes a saint of a very high quality.

332
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:40,483
And their methodology is so pure and beautiful

333
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:43,331
that after watching them more people join Sahajyoga.

334
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,990
Their life is full of love and enjoyment.

335
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:52,983
With that too people think that they have not seen anything like that

336
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:58,331
There is no problem, no confusion of any type

337
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:03,546
and the greatest thing is that the character of Sahajyogis

338
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:13,344
and specially, special character, with great morality gets nourished.

339
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:18,183
I have seen foreigners who take drugs

340
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:22,917
if they get realisation today, they give up drugs only next day.

341
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:26,203
And their eye which would move here and there

342
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:29,092
would absolutely get innocent.

343
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:32,766
Very beautiful! Full of innocense!

344
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:36,847
In this way, if a human being knows himself

345
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:44,985
it is a very beautiful grateful and a special thing God has created

346
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,488
So, I have to tell everybody that you get your realisation first.

347
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:52,592
There is no need even to trust ME.

348
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,938
It is quite possible that I too may put you into wrong concepts.

349
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:59,334
So, first you get your realisation and after that understand it.

350
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:04,532
Because due to superstitions also there has been a great loss to us.

351
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:09,855
I don't want that you should trust on ME blindfoldedly.

352
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,062
Now the obstacles that we face are like this

353
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:18,747
that if anyone is extremely foolish, then we can't do anything.

354
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,725
Sahajyoga is not for the fools.

355
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,738
Next if anyone is very head strong and tends to do his own way

356
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:30,701
his kundalini too will not awaken.

357
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:35,172
Thirdly, those who are great sinners and very wicked

358
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:36,653
their kundalini too does not awaken.

359
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:40,704
If you say," Mother please give realisation to Hitler". I can't give.

360
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:47,890
There are such people too who have gone to wrong gurus

361
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,222
they have been influenced by them

362
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,829
there will be a little difficulty in giving them realisation.

363
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:56,673
For example some people are such that

364
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:01,557
they are attatched to something, to some dharma, to this, to that.

365
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:07,998
If you really want independence

366
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,321
then first awaken the mechanism of self.

367
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,095
When that is done

368
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,641
for that there is no worry, you will understand everything.

369
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,018
But it is important

370
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:23,249
that your spirit should first come to your attention.

371
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,165
There are many advantages of Sahajyoga.

372
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:32,356
Some of these I can tell today.

373
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:36,812
Because, it has so many advantages and everytime

374
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,551
for example, I come across some people telling ME

375
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,692
i have been benefitted in this way, in that way.

376
00:27:41,717 --> 00:27:46,721
But if we classify it

377
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:49,732
the first and greatest advantage of it is

378
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:52,742
that you will get your health benefits.

379
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,141
because when your chakras get weakened

380
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:10,493
whichever chakra gets like that

381
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:14,252
that part of the body gets effected by some disease

382
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:21,659
It is difficult to make you understand particularly about that

383
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:27,364
but in Delhi University

384
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:33,184
four doctors  were honoured  M.D for Sahajyoga.

385
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:36,622
They had worked on four topics

386
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:42,383
and all the four topics are such that

387
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:45,583
that we cannot cure diseases.

388
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,005
For example Asthma.

389
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,548
Asthma can be cured by Sahajyoga.

390
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:58,242
Now if we talk about it extensively

391
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:05,646
that when we think too much.

392
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:11,946
Just now we think about our future

393
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:15,489
then we plan a lot.

394
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:20,274
So, our power of our right side

395
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:26,901
it works in a more special way.

396
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:35,341
One is that, our liver and your pancreas

397
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:40,575
your spleen and intestines.

398
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:46,645
To all these only one chakra gives energy and that is Swadishthan.

399
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,647
But when you think

400
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,222
it gives enrgy even to the grey cells of our brain.

401
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,829
When you think more than your need, and get worried

402
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:07,874
you are futuristic.

403
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:13,648
So the energy that we have in this chakra gets utilized in that.

404
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:17,565
The grey cells of your brain go on changing

405
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,232
your liver is out of order

406
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:24,903
your Pancrease, your spleen and your intestines are out of order.

407
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:37,482
Now, liver's this work that the poison that is inside your being

408
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:42,756
it takes out of one's body in the form of heat.

409
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:50,463
For example, the blood that goes to liver

410
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:56,798
the heat is sucked byit (liver).

411
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:57,938
It is a very great task.

412
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:03,000
If liver doesn't work, gets weak

413
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:06,740
this heat moves upwards.

414
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,191
When it starts moving upwards

415
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:14,090
we say that inside us there is a chakra which is Right Heart

416
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:20,588
which manages our lungs.

417
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:26,345
When this chakra gets heat

418
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,709
that causes Asthma in us.

419
00:31:32,154 --> 00:31:38,001
Now when this heat

420
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:42,684
reaches pancrease, it causes Diabetese.

421
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,872
Diabetese often occurs to those

422
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:49,619
who are futuristic, those who plan with paper and pen.

423
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:52,031
Poor people do not get diabetese

424
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:55,544
because they are not bothered about future.

425
00:31:55,569 --> 00:32:00,164
Today they eat food, sleep, next day get up and go to work.

426
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:05,096
They may take sugar four to five spoons, it hardly matters.

427
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,785
This disease attacks

428
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,730
those who take too much help of their wisdom

429
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:16,364
and those who are futuristic.

430
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:23,073
Then a very serious disease attacks your spleen.

431
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,347
The job of spleen is that it controls your speedometer.

432
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:36,983
The work that you are doing, you do it rhythmically

433
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:41,337
or you get up in the morning, you rush, take smething

434
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:42,761
and then drive the car

435
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:46,329
and then on the way read the news or something

436
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,357
the brain gets all the more out of order

437
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,238
then went to office , there also got rebuked.

438
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,648
This spedometer doesn't understand

439
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,493
what has happened to this man?

440
00:32:57,565 --> 00:32:58,565
He becomes mad.

441
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,561
When the spleen goes out of order,

442
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:05,138
at that stage if he gets any shock or is affected

443
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:09,373
he gets diseases like blood cancer and lukemia.

444
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:12,456
And that too many people in Sahajyoga have got.

445
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:16,252
Then it efects your kidney.

446
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:22,719
So the kidney also shrivels (shrinks) by this heat.

447
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:27,643
Because of that the urine gets blocked.

448
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:33,389
They put you on Dialysis and you become bankrupt

449
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:36,361
and you have to die surely.

450
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:42,439
Then after that it effects your intestines

451
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:49,309
you cannot digest your food and you have constipation.

452
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:56,042
Sometimes it takes a very serious turn

453
00:33:56,836 --> 00:33:59,022
and then I told you about lungs also.

454
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:02,519
But when there is a child

455
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:10,680
there is a young boy of eighteen / nineteen years old, drinks

456
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:18,245
heat on account of that causes massive heart attack to him.

457
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,430
His life cannot be saved.

458
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,867
That is why it is said, that if somebody gets massive heart attack

459
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:29,022
his life cannot be saved.

460
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,543
There will be complete end of his life.

461
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:39,133
Then about this heat I have to say that

462
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:44,944
if a human being goes on like this , his heart can also be effected.

463
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,538
Anytime he can have a massive heart attack in his life time.

464
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:51,846
That also causes death.

465
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:54,509
Thirdly, he can have paralysis.

466
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:56,943
His right side will be paralysed.

467
00:34:56,968 --> 00:35:03,820
It means that nature too teaches us balancing.

468
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,539
If we use our right side too much

469
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,875
our right side will be constricted.

470
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:14,109
if the right side is constricted, you cannot do any work.

471
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:17,783
This I have told you only about one chakra.

472
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:22,063
You can understand that it causes so many diseases.

473
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:25,405
And inside our being there are seven chakras.

474
00:35:26,294 --> 00:35:28,317
kundalini pierces six chakras

475
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:39,823
and if your six chakras get alright

476
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:45,382
your health will be perfectly alright.

477
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,212
Then you will have no problem.

478
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:53,537
With the help of this, cancer and many other diseases have been cured

479
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:54,597
and can be cured.

480
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:58,250
But first of all there should be self realisation.

481
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:02,042
And it is not necessary that you should collect all the sick people.

482
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:05,852
For example, if we cure one, they get ten more to be cured

483
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:09,693
and those who get sick, mostly I have noticed that by curing them

484
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:14,814
out of them five to ten percent take to Sahajyoga.

485
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,541
Rest of them get cured and go, they get back their diseases

486
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,293
Get their heart disease again.

487
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:22,793
Those who settle down in Sahajyoga

488
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,837
sensibly

489
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:31,931
they are completely healthy.

490
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:37,046
Now the second benifit is that

491
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,971
that peace settles in your heart.

492
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:47,244
We are always thinking

493
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,122
about our future

494
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:54,810
or we think about the past

495
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,671
and we jump on these thoughts

496
00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:00,774
that which is present we cannot remain stationed.

497
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,663
But one thought comes and falls down

498
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:09,230
second thought rises and comes down.

499
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:12,530
In this way there is a chain of thoughts

500
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,296
and between these

501
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:18,370
there is a little space which is called VILAMBH (pause)

502
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:23,329
that is present but there out attention doesn't stick

503
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:26,685
With the awakening of Kundalini, these thoughts disperse

504
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,221
and gets elongated

505
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:36,098
and the space in between, that is our present.

506
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:42,359
and the present only is that is truth.

507
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:50,841
Rest,  past is over and the future is not there.

508
00:37:50,866 --> 00:37:52,801
In the present you settle down.

509
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:55,514
When you settle in the present,

510
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,041
total peace settles inside your being.

511
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:02,122
In the same way, For example

512
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:05,144
you are standing in water and the waves are rising

513
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:08,533
you don't know swimming and you become nervous.

514
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,552
But if you come into the boat, you see the waves too.

515
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:16,298
But if you know swimming, you can jump and save them too.

516
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:21,065
Those who don't know swimming and are sinking

517
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:23,702
Just the same happens in Sahajyoga.

518
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:28,270
First, people attain that state

519
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:30,957
which is called thoughtless awareness

520
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:39,904
means without any thought

521
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:43,356
which is called 'Nirvichaar Samadhi'.

522
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:45,131
This is the first state.

523
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,453
and after that the state which comes

524
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:52,767
is called 'Nirvikalp Samadhi'.

525
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:55,074
Means that no doubt remains

526
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,545
about one's own self, about Sahajyoga and about one's powers.

527
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:04,283
Such a person has full confidence, what is Sahajyoga?

528
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,291
and then he does the work of Sahajyoga.

529
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:13,810
This state has come to many for the first time.

530
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,684
and some take time

531
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:20,053
and by getting Nirvichaar samadhi

532
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:23,495
you become absolutely peaceful.

533
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:29,087
This is the state of your inner peace that we have to get.

534
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:34,771
With the help of this, our past thoughts and violence

535
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:38,224
and our tendendency to destroy others gets over.

536
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:43,474
Because the peace that is settled within us

537
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:53,081
we experience with a great joy and ease.

538
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:59,347
Then we don't like to hate anyone to criticize anyone

539
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:02,947
to be egoistic.

540
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:10,941
We don't have any greed for any thing.

541
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:13,707
All this greed is over.

542
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:22,904
And a human being peacefully witnesses the whole world

543
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:29,192
And in this witness state he thinks it was all like a drama.

544
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:30,426
I came out of it.

545
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:35,353
Now i am not in this traffic. I am sitting outside on a mountain.

546
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:38,666
He moves away from it.

547
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:43,395
The questions that he has are over very easily

548
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,334
because he has come out of it.

549
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:53,722
And apart from that, this supreme power of love becomes active.

550
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:55,175
Questions are over.

551
00:40:57,452 --> 00:41:02,677
Another great advantage that your subtle powers

552
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,520
the power of creativity gets awakened

553
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,159
Every type of creative power

554
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:09,880
I have seen, got awakened in such people

555
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:14,589
where there was no hope that they will do some such creative work.

556
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:23,378
Third thing is that, because of your mental peace

557
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:26,918
you give mental peace to others too.

558
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:30,816
Wherever such a person exists, there peace prevails.

559
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:34,725
Only by giving award, nobody gets peace.

560
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,380
By telling that somebody is messenger of peace

561
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:38,626
there cannot be peace.

562
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,610
Peace is within our being.

563
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:44,530
And when such peace establishes within us

564
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,876
we become totally fearless.

565
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:51,344
As Kabira has said, "I will sing NIRBHAY, NIRGUN GAUNGA MAI."

566
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:53,826
So fear goes off.

567
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:59,509
Such a person leads a fearless and truthful life.

568
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:02,092
Christ's case is very interesting.

569
00:42:02,362 --> 00:42:04,927
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

570
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:06,641
Every body stoned her.

571
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,074
After stones were thrown at her

572
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,903
when she came to the edge of the village

573
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,523
Christ went and stood and picked up a stone

574
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:18,213
and said that the stones which all of you are throwing

575
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:22,083
out of them, the person who has never committed any sin

576
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:23,266
hit stones at ME.

577
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,579
It was such a  courageous act.

578
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:28,261
Everybody put their stones on to the ground.

579
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:31,240
And then to that Mary Magdalene

580
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:34,032
He changed her life

581
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:39,504
gave her a very great a powerful state of yoga.

582
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:48,704
So, it is proved that you in a way in the light of your spirit

583
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:55,493
get completely, an inner security.

584
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:57,011
It is a very great job.

585
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:04,360
Now because of that many people get breast cancer or other diseases

586
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:09,581
Thirdly many people who didn't know how to sing, started singing.

587
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:11,514
Many people who were scared of delivering a speech

588
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:12,961
started giving speeches.

589
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:19,300
And for example, you pay your attention towards others

590
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:24,709
as to what are the good attributes in them.

591
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:27,876
And pay attention to what bad quality they have in their ownself.

592
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,976
For example, when you are away from yourself, you ask.

593
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:33,860
Then you see what is wrong with your society.

594
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:36,405
Then you see what is wrong with your country

595
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,777
Before this, if we tell somebody

596
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:39,465
that there is something wrong with your society

597
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,902
they will run to kill us.

598
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,746
Now they think that this is wrong, let us get rid of it.

599
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:49,886
In this way, purity of one's own life

600
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:54,182
One who is such a great human being

601
00:43:54,222 --> 00:44:00,471
he purifies all his own society and his country.

602
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,150
He doesn't think, Why should he do?

603
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,456
Why should he do this clearing?

604
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:08,981
I have got it and am sitting comfortably.

605
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,620
I have got it and I shall now enjoy it.

606
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:13,996
It is not like this.

607
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:17,181
Such a person has got such a desire from his inner self

608
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:19,052
because he becomes compassionate.

609
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:22,481
I have got it, why not to give it to others.

610
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:26,420
And because of that they work so hard that I am surprised

611
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:30,820
In this way , those who became Sahajyogis helped ME.

612
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,947
I cannot explain this.

613
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:43,665
Another thing is that with the help of Sahajyoga our wisdom

614
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:54,251
what we think that we are very intelligent

615
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:57,184
Wisdom becomes balanced

616
00:44:57,209 --> 00:45:01,588
and you get Divine discretion.

617
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,595
You know who is right and who is not

618
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,358
how much you must say, how much you must tell

619
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:08,831
what should you say

620
00:45:09,347 --> 00:45:16,210
and whatever you do, its effect will be deep and wide spread.

621
00:45:16,907 --> 00:45:23,307
Somebody's gravity, individuality, for example I say

622
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:29,465
universe, collectivity and to know oneself.

623
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:34,710
And in this collectivity, he is a part of this universe.

624
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:38,380
Then he understands what is this creation

625
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:43,266
what is this mountain and what is this stream, what is this sea.

626
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:50,944
After looking at it, he gets a spiritual feeling about it.

627
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:57,267
And it can solve your ecological problems too.

628
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:02,510
For example a human being uses such things which are man made

629
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:04,618
which cleans this environment.

630
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:06,555
There is no need to say

631
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:11,494
and I found that people got their children (to ME)

632
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:16,400
They are very dull, they don't study at all and like that.

633
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:20,537
Those boys stood first. Not only this, they got scholarship.

634
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:28,407
It sharpens your wisdom and along with that you get lot of wisdom

635
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:31,708
I have seen children, they go to school

636
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,123
till are not set in ( Sahajyoga)

637
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:37,234
I don't like to eat this, I want that, do this , do that.

638
00:46:37,988 --> 00:46:40,796
After staying there for one year

639
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:44,311
these children become so sensible

640
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:45,918
so much sensible that

641
00:46:45,943 --> 00:46:49,172
parents are surprised what has happened to the children.

642
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:50,086
We won't insist for anything.

643
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,304
If there is a good television anywhere, we won't watch.

644
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:54,643
We won't go anywhere, we will stay at home

645
00:46:54,668 --> 00:46:55,967
we will eat home made food.

646
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:57,831
Oh! Say something!

647
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,332
No we don't want anything.

648
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:01,514
Ok! Let us watch flowers in the lawn.

649
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:05,708
Either we can go to some cloth museum

650
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:07,914
or to some zoo

651
00:47:08,054 --> 00:47:11,498
In this way children's temper changes

652
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:16,049
and children respect everyone in an orderly manner.

653
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:21,249
The greatest thing is that we don't respect anything now a days.

654
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,396
we don't respect our land

655
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:27,379
because she is our mother, we don't respect Sun

656
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:29,335
and the greatest thing is that

657
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:33,335
we don't respect our parents, nor our culture.

658
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,881
Then we get awakened in Sahaj culture.

659
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:39,842
It is a great new thing.

660
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:42,377
In that a human being becomes moral.

661
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,385
He happens to be like that. We don't have to tell him.

662
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,072
I don't tell anyone to be moral.

663
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:49,871
He becomes absolutely moral.

664
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:51,716
I have seen that those who use abusive language,

665
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:53,496
get rid of the abusive words.

666
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:56,161
Those who drink, give it up.

667
00:47:56,256 --> 00:48:01,119
Every type of immorality that we see in Kaliyuga, comes to end.

668
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:08,026
This great benefit that is going to be in our society

669
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,023
can be with the help of Sahaj yoga.

670
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:12,737
It cannot be by giving lectures.

671
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:14,785
If you give lectures

672
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,830
morality cannot get awakened.

673
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:23,660
The same thing I have seen with respect to religions.

674
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:27,712
If you say in any religion that you do whatever you want to do

675
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,958
have freedom like Christians.

676
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,382
That has not allowed them to be moral.

677
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:35,180
The other religions were like this

678
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,894
don't do this , don't do that

679
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:38,819
not to do like this, not to do like that.

680
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:41,148
They are all the more immoral.

681
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:43,711
They want to come stealthily.

682
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:47,558
That morality awakens within

683
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:51,562
and such a great moral society is created.

684
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:53,910
Such people do not tell a lie.

685
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:57,335
Such people do not grab money.

686
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,358
Such people do not trouble anyone.

687
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,251
Don't talk against anyone.

688
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:06,608
Every time they think how to give them comfort.

689
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:13,433
How to make them to get rid of their bad habits.

690
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:17,450
All the time compassion flows on like this.

691
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:22,121
And I didn't see many people, they got perfectly alright.

692
00:49:22,637 --> 00:49:24,152
This is the hard work of Sahajyogis

693
00:49:24,177 --> 00:49:25,648
because of which all this happened.

694
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:34,302
It is this morality coming within us, we should say

695
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:39,314
that keeps the society organised.

696
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:41,814
That disciplines the children

697
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,398
The greatest thing is that your health improves.

698
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:52,291
In the modern times if you see how many diseases are there

699
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:55,116
these are mostly because of immorality.

700
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,024
Now secondly, we should think

701
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:01,348
that with respect to religion

702
00:50:02,325 --> 00:50:07,260
We should right now give preference to this

703
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:11,495
that all the religions are dependant on spiritualism.

704
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,743
Whichever religion it is

705
00:50:13,768 --> 00:50:17,521
whether it is Christian religion or Muslim religion

706
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:19,520
Their predecessors

707
00:50:19,545 --> 00:50:23,060
nowhere they said that their religion is a separate religion.

708
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:27,078
Now Muhammad Sahab never said

709
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:30,402
that this religion is a separate one. He simply talked about Moses

710
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:35,329
talked about Ibraham, talked about Jesus (NOT CLEAR).

711
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,281
Talked about everyone

712
00:50:36,322 --> 00:50:39,075
Then He said that lacks of people are reborn.

713
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:40,667
(INAUDIBLE)

714
00:50:40,692 --> 00:50:43,576
He also said that

715
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:49,860
When twelfth (INAUDIBLE)

716
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:58,483
then that will take you to the road of ascent

717
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:01,201
He called that kiyama.

718
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,714
So He said this about future.

719
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:05,264
Like that Jesus Christ.

720
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:11,570
HE also talked about Moses, Abraham and about all others

721
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:13,455
And when HE was hanging on the cross

722
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,368
HE had said,"Behold the Mother."

723
00:51:15,393 --> 00:51:17,368
HE talked about Mother

724
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,483
He also did not make any such religion that

725
00:51:20,508 --> 00:51:22,914
it is My religion different from Other's religion.

726
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:23,942
Showed like this

727
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,974
that one after the other Dharmas were there in the world.

728
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,255
But even then people separated the religions.

729
00:51:31,985 --> 00:51:33,882
This is not the reality

730
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:39,351
The essence of every religion is just one.

731
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:44,458
The aim is just one that your rebirth should take place

732
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:48,795
and your spirit should get enlightened.

733
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,483
This is the essence of it.

734
00:51:52,508 --> 00:51:56,407
I would like to say that those who talk about secularism

735
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,049
they should follow Gandhiji's secularism.

736
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:03,373
Gandhiji from the beginning

737
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:06,278
the mantras that he has written in his Bhajnawali

738
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:09,757
they are all about Kundalini.

739
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:16,359
First he talked about heart because He said in heart

740
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:19,133
(NOT CLEAR)

741
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:21,768
that which is felt inside my heart

742
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:24,117
is ATMA TATVA..............

743
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,231
after that from Shree Ganesha

744
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:30,750
those who are separate dieties in different chakras

745
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,429
one after the other starts the names of all Gods

746
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:38,846
Along with this HE talked about kuran

747
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:43,424
Then talked about Buddha's "Buddham Sharnam Gachchami" etc.

748
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,463
Next Lord's prayer of Christians

749
00:52:47,488 --> 00:52:49,618
spread even of Mahavira

750
00:52:49,643 --> 00:52:53,083
and all the people whether he may be a Muslim, Hindu or a Christian

751
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:58,137
who lived in their Ashram and would come there

752
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,681
Everyone respected all of these

753
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:06,495
would recite the name of all of these and worship them.

754
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:11,390
Now it is that the meaning of secularism is

755
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:12,663
I can't understand.

756
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:16,017
Because somewhere some dharma, at other places the other dharma.

757
00:53:16,072 --> 00:53:18,138
We think that in foreign countries, there is secularism

758
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,520
It is not so at all.

759
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:23,865
In France it is absolutely, they say

760
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:30,869
France is the eldest daughter of our Catholic Church

761
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:33,793
Some where there are Catholic Churches

762
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:35,338
and at other places there are protestants

763
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:40,227
and  where there is no other religion, for example Islamic religion.

764
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:43,836
All of them exist independantly.

765
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:45,367
For example, a different religion of theirs

766
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:46,499
a different religion of others

767
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:48,558
a different religion of still others, it is not so.

768
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,369
Now the misunderstandings that are in our country

769
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,211
because the most imortant point is that

770
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:55,007
in our house we adhere to Hindu Dharma.

771
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:59,153
In Hindu Dharma it has never been talked about.

772
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:01,890
First of all castiesm is not a good thing.

773
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,171
because that which has been said in casteism

774
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:08,532
for the Devi it has been said

775
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:13,157
YA DEVI SARVA BHTESHU JATI RUPEN SANSTHITA

776
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:18,530
Jati means your liking,your aptitude

777
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:20,085
that Jati

778
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,280
now try to understand

779
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:25,783
if you are in search of God you are a Brahmin

780
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:30,886
and if you want to rule you are a KHATRIYA

781
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,899
and if you want to do business you are a BANIYA

782
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:41,808
and those who want to earn money by serving others are SHUDRAS.

783
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:45,921
But this Jati was according to karmas earlier

784
00:54:45,946 --> 00:54:48,232
and not according to birth.

785
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:53,185
Do you see anyone who says that I am in search of Bramha.

786
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,626
I have not seen such a Bramhin.

787
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:57,773
They are ruling as Brahmins.

788
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:00,156
They are KHATRIYAS. They are not Brahmins.

789
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:06,514
In this way I am going to give you proof of casteism

790
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,894
When Shri Ram went to jungle

791
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:15,174
Shabri , an old woman had very few teeth

792
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,254
tasted each piece of berry gave these to Shri Ram

793
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,555
Shri Ram said: Oh! how sweet and nice these are!

794
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:32,656
He took berries and started eating. He said this is just Amrit!

795
00:55:32,885 --> 00:55:38,581
His wife said I should also get some share as I am your better half.

796
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:39,623
But Laxmanji was getting very angry

797
00:55:39,648 --> 00:55:43,638
that this old lady is touching the berries to her teeth

798
00:55:43,663 --> 00:55:45,080
and feeding ( SHREE RAM)

799
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:49,171
(Bhini si) means SHUDRA (Low Caste)

800
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:54,607
Then His wife Sitaji said: How nice these berries are!

801
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:56,699
Laxmanji said: Give me too some.

802
00:55:56,802 --> 00:55:58,289
Why shall I give, you are getting angry?

803
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,071
He said : Plz give me some.

804
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:03,641
After taking these he said :These are just like AMRUT.

805
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:07,286
This is an example of Shri Ram Chanderji

806
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:11,749
that HE would not give importance to SHUDRA (caste system)etc.

807
00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:14,730
Then Ramayan was written by Balmiki ji

808
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:17,412
who was a fisherman

809
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,215
and then he was a robber.

810
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,247
and then you must be knowing his story very well

811
00:56:23,272 --> 00:56:24,815
how he became a saint.

812
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,815
He asked him to write Ramayana.

813
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,283
Didn't he get anyone else?

814
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:34,282
It was to prove that a human being's caste

815
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,885
is according to his KARMA (PROFESSION)

816
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:40,056
Then have a look at Shri Krishna. He too is an unusual personality

817
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:43,360
that He would go to Vidhur's house to have his simple food

818
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:46,102
and He didn't take fruit at Duryodan's house.

819
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:52,296
because Duryodan, whatever he considered himself was an evil person.

820
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:56,486
and whose veg he would take

821
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:57,903
was after all the son of a female slave.

822
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:00,699
He would have his food at the house of the son of a female slave

823
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,838
because He was a realised soul.

824
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:05,137
He would take his food at Vidhur's house

825
00:57:05,162 --> 00:57:07,337
but He would not take at Duryodan's house

826
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:09,532
and then His too

827
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:12,139
and even about Krishna,

828
00:57:12,164 --> 00:57:14,060
who has written?

829
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:17,725
Gita is a wonderful compilation.

830
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:24,282
that Vyas ji, it should be said that

831
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:30,324
he was an illegitimate or illegal child.

832
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:35,095
He wrote Shri Krishna's Gita.

833
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:41,393
It proves they wanted to prove that caste system is useless.

834
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:43,950
but we do not understand all this.

835
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:48,505
Even now we talk about cast, this and that.

836
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,566
And whatever karma we do

837
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,780
never think that this is our caste, we belong to this caste.

838
00:57:55,165 --> 00:57:58,078
It is nowhere in the world.

839
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,006
This is the quality of our country.

840
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:04,174
Now because of this casteism so many conflicts have come up.

841
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:09,666
We got so many Harijans of this country married in foreign countries.

842
00:58:10,016 --> 00:58:11,746
People in foreign countries  don't know anything.

843
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,568
Harijan they think, means people of Hari.

844
00:58:14,593 --> 00:58:17,753
They hold them in high esteem and have lot of respect for them.

845
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:23,637
But still we are infested with this thought that he is a Harijan.

846
00:58:23,987 --> 00:58:28,996
Now they have accepted Buddh Dharma, still they are Harjans.

847
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:37,762
Next, within the Dharma too there are so many disputes

848
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,387
they will quarrel inside a mosque

849
00:58:40,412 --> 00:58:42,902
they will quarrell for the statue of Parsavnath.

850
00:58:42,927 --> 00:58:45,564
Wherever you go, Dharma means to quarrell.

851
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:47,556
There will be a dispute between Shias and Sunis

852
00:58:47,715 --> 00:58:49,107
How can that be?

853
00:58:49,132 --> 00:58:52,384
If dharma is one, why your disputes?

854
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:58,445
Now we should think that there is some fault in it.

855
00:58:58,561 --> 00:58:59,224
That in this way

856
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:03,201
we are fighting in the name of Dharma, in the name of God

857
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:07,292
How is it possible? It is impossible.

858
00:59:07,372 --> 00:59:09,784
It means that we are away from God.

859
00:59:10,038 --> 00:59:14,548
We are not closer to God. If a human being understands this

860
00:59:14,573 --> 00:59:17,446
God's work is to give love

861
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,564
have to bring together everybody

862
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,603
have to essemble everybody in Samashti (COLLECTIVITY).

863
00:59:21,628 --> 00:59:23,360
All these disputes will be over.

864
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,058
But it cannot be with the help of wisdom

865
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,549
The work done by wisdom

866
00:59:27,574 --> 00:59:31,371
goes on and on and on  from here with thoughts

867
00:59:31,396 --> 00:59:32,587
and then returns back.

868
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:36,333
There is no truth in it. What's the basis to support it?

869
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:40,074
But the thought of Atma is spread all over.

870
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:43,247
Now it is going on spreading.

871
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:46,641
It doesn't have any apprehension of falling down.

872
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:50,632
Because of this we see that the Dharma

873
00:59:50,657 --> 00:59:52,765
people have made out of their minds,

874
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,823
one should say, made a system of it

875
00:59:55,848 --> 00:59:58,117
and made its repurcussions.

876
00:59:58,156 --> 01:00:01,484
That has caused notions about Dharma

877
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:03,623
and has twisted and returned back again.

878
01:00:03,648 --> 01:00:05,853
It is called 'Bhoomrang' in English.

879
01:00:05,878 --> 01:00:08,489
In this way it has mesmerrised a human being.

880
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:11,849
But now they are fighting and quarrelling.

881
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,976
It should not be so in our country.

882
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:17,986
Don't know how many saints and sages must have been here

883
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:22,240
and never did any saint talk like this.

884
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:29,867
Some time there were Brahmins, there were Shudras too

885
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,131
and there were many types of casts as well.

886
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:38,651
But one saint respects another saint  with love.

887
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,962
It can happen only when you are a real saint.

888
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,484
Then you will have respect towards another person

889
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:47,620
then your questions will be over.

890
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:51,985
If I will say a little bit at the end

891
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:56,260
in Maharashtra there was a poet named Nam Dev

892
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,148
whom Guru Nanak also recognised

893
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:05,090
and another  saint was a potter.

894
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:09,694
Namdev went to meet him.

895
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:12,599
He went to see him.

896
01:01:12,624 --> 01:01:15,019
On seeing him, he stood up immediately.

897
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:17,424
In Marathi he said

898
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:20,296
NIRGUNA CHA BETI ALO SAGUNA SANGHEY

899
01:01:20,321 --> 01:01:23,808
I had come to see NIRGUNA in you, Chaitanya in you

900
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:24,967
SAGUNA is standing in front of me.

901
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,891
One saint is saying to another saint.

902
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:31,971
saints have always respected saints.

903
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:34,026
Among Muslims those who are Sufis

904
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:40,323
Hazrat Muhammad Nizamudin Sahab, then Khusro Sahab

905
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:41,921
Mouddin Sahab

906
01:01:41,946 --> 01:01:43,457
In this way everywhere

907
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,417
I have seen Sufis

908
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:53,965
they are in Erussia and are in Turkey.

909
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,536
And in Turkey there were some old Sufis.

910
01:01:56,561 --> 01:02:03,752
They said that Shri Mataji's work is greater than that of Fatima B.

911
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:05,428
Now they will recognise ME.

912
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:08,499
Now they are no more in this world but his disciples recognise ME.

913
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,546
In this way, in every family

914
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:13,737
such were saints and sages, in every dharma.

915
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:15,416
there was no such dharma.

916
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,650
And they all think that

917
01:02:18,063 --> 01:02:25,653
all the religions are the out come of one tree of spiritualism.

918
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:27,593
And they don't have this question

919
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,033
because we are in darkness and don't know

920
01:02:31,058 --> 01:02:34,641
and  we quarrell in this darkness, in this ignorance.

921
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:38,172
This problem  instantly gets over in Sahajyoga

922
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:42,572
Not only this if the dispute of various Dharmas is over

923
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:43,819
but the countries

924
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,077
the countries which once were our enemies

925
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,732
are friendly in Sahajyoga today.

926
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:56,253
Everywhere Iranians, Pakistanis

927
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,241
poeple have come from far off countries

928
01:02:58,384 --> 01:03:00,565
I am so surprised to find

929
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,701
how much they have progressed

930
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:04,197
and how they have evolved to this stage.

931
01:03:04,428 --> 01:03:08,133
In this way what we call national integration

932
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:10,813
it cannot be done by force.

933
01:03:11,345 --> 01:03:14,084
It cannot be done by making to understand or by giving lectures.

934
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:17,271
With the help of  inner transformation, it takes place on its own.

935
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:22,200
No need to say anything!
