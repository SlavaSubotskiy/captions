1
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:09,804
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

2
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:16,846
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

3
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,346
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

4
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:32,929
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

5
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:43,180
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

6
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,013
He is the source.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,888
He’s the source of spirituality.

8
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:07,054
As a result of that all other things follow.

9
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,929
Like when it rains and is windy

10
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:16,888
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

11
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:26,929
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

12
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,888
we feel all these three things within and without.

13
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:44,096
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

14
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:54,804
that the most important fundamental Deity

15
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:58,804
has been completely not only neglected,

16
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:02,888
but insulted and crucified.

17
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:09,346
So today though I did not want to say anything

18
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:15,804
to upset you people, but I must tell you

19
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:23,221
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

20
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:26,013
a thorough cleansing within you.

21
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:30,763
When you worship Shri Ganesha

22
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:37,888
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

23
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,013
keep your being clean -

24
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:46,096
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

25
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,180
Actually when the Kundalini rises

26
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:54,096
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

27
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,763
the innocence has to come up –

28
00:02:56,804 --> 00:03:07,096
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

29
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:14,888
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

30
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:20,305
that we have to mature.

31
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,888
People are sick now.

32
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:32,971
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

33
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:38,263
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

34
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:45,846
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

35
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:53,929
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

36
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:59,096
there was nothing more important than that.

37
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:11,013
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

38
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:15,305
and the power of conditionings we have had.

39
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:18,221
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

40
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:21,305
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

41
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:22,346
terrible.

42
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:33,305
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

43
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:38,221
is not at all important.

44
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,346
It is only when you want to have children

45
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,221
actually a human being

46
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:50,929
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

47
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,929
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

48
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:01,888
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

49
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:15,888
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

50
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:23,221
it comes from a very low grading within us.

51
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:28,888
It comes from the low-graded human beings

52
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,846
that one becomes servile to it.

53
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,096
You should be the master of that.

54
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:48,929
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

55
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,096
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

56
00:05:54,305 --> 00:06:02,888
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

57
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:09,804
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

58
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,888
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

59
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,054
and a pure personality.

60
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:27,221
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

61
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,054
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

62
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,888
I mean, you just don’t understand,

63
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:35,929
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

64
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:41,138
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

65
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,929
We have to mature ourselves.

66
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:51,846
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

67
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:58,305
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

68
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:01,804
But of course you must mature;

69
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,971
you need a tapasya for that.

70
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:10,138
Unimportant thing when become important

71
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:16,096
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

72
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,929
that we have, like we have hair.

73
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:22,054
Even if you lose hair it means something.

74
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:26,305
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

75
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,846
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

76
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,929
Such a waste of energy.

77
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:43,263
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

78
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,346
so much of auspiciousness is spent

79
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:49,263
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

80
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:57,013
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

81
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,054
we have to mature.

82
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,263
Maturity has to come within us.

83
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:10,971
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

84
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:17,180
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

85
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:23,929
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

86
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:34,013
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

87
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:39,013
or a pressure on people.

88
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:49,054
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

89
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:52,138
for you people, very costly.

90
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:55,180
You have paid through so much;

91
00:08:56,846 --> 00:09:00,763
you have gone through so much. For what?

92
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:12,346
So the priorities have to change

93
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:15,221
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

94
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:21,096
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

95
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:28,846
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

96
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:36,138
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

97
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:38,971
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

98
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:48,096
is the basic of this whole Creation;

99
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:54,054
is the essence of this Creation.

100
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:02,804
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

101
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:08,804
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

102
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:11,305
who are primitive, then comes the stage

103
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:15,054
where human beings are developed.

104
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:19,804
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

105
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:22,971
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

106
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,763
What is development is not outside.

107
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:30,221
What is the within development one has to see.

108
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,221
What have we grown inside?

109
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:39,013
What have we got inside ourselves?

110
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:47,929
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

111
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:52,971
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

112
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:55,346
say, for example, I give you a mango.

113
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,054
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

114
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:02,221
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

115
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:07,263
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

116
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:17,263
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

117
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,971
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

118
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,888
What is our substance within ourselves?

119
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:38,096
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

120
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:42,221
So important for Him it was.

121
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:46,346
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

122
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:49,888
where of course morality is very important,

123
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:57,221
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

124
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:02,305
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

125
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:06,138
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

126
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:09,096
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

127
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:12,763
But it should be your own innate light,

128
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:15,888
that’s why Christ talked about it.

129
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:27,013
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

130
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:36,763
And I would not say that people were not warned.

131
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:39,346
Freud was not the only person who was born.

132
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:46,096
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

133
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:50,305
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

134
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:54,346
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

135
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:57,346
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

136
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,263
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

137
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:04,180
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

138
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,888
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

139
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,929
then the attack of the death, all these things.

140
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:14,221
I mean he was quite a recent person.

141
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:22,054
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

142
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:26,846
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

143
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:37,804
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

144
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,763
since long we know about hell.

145
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:45,138
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

146
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,971
This is hell.

147
00:13:53,846 --> 00:14:02,138
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

148
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:09,763
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

149
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,971
Is it mental power that’s important?

150
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,971
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

151
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,263
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

152
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:27,305
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

153
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:34,054
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

154
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:40,096
What is your emotional power?

155
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:44,346
Emotions that you have takes you where?

156
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:51,138
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

157
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:54,846
Say, you love your wife very much.

158
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,888
Where does it take you?

159
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,846
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

160
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:06,221
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

161
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:13,763
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

162
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:21,054
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

163
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,054
She said, “How did you climb?”

164
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,138
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

165
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,888
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

166
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,846
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

167
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:35,221
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

168
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:44,929
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

169
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:48,138
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

170
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:55,180
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

171
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,888
which destroys others.

172
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,138
And the emotional power gives you

173
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,305
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

174
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:09,096
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

175
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:12,138
on such and such person and what did I get?”

176
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:21,929
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

177
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:26,763
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

178
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:29,888
Emotionally you are zero

179
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:37,888
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

180
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:47,804
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

181
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:55,971
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

182
00:16:55,971 --> 00:17:02,180
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

183
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,263
Then what is your power?

184
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:11,096
Is your chastity.

185
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:18,763
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

186
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:31,346
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

187
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:43,763
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

188
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:49,929
From the face of a person you can say

189
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,138
that this person is a chaste man.

190
00:17:52,138 --> 00:18:02,929
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

191
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:05,221
the one who has never had sex in life,

192
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,929
always shining on his face.

193
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:13,263
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

194
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,804
who has so many wives.

195
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:27,929
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

196
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,346
So the whole energy is inside.

197
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:34,263
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

198
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:39,138
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

199
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:46,846
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

200
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:50,846
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

201
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:57,221
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

202
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:02,346
Because we kept to our own vehicle

203
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:07,138
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

204
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:14,804
We are so particular that others must respect us,

205
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:18,846
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

206
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:29,263
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

207
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,221
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

208
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:44,221
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

209
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,221
Many people think that way.

210
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,346
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

211
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:57,888
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

212
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,971
aesthetics, of course.

213
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:06,846
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

214
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:11,888
But culture you better learn from Indians.

215
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,888
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

216
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:27,054
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

217
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:32,346
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

218
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:47,305
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

219
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:52,804
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

220
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:02,804
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

221
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:08,138
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

222
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:14,013
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

223
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,180
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

224
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:22,221
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

225
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:25,180
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

226
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:31,763
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

227
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:36,846
you can not understand that there can be someone

228
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:39,221
who is absolutely chaste.

229
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,846
For a thief everybody is a thief.

230
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:51,929
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

231
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,971
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

232
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:58,096
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

233
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,263
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

234
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:07,846
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

235
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:15,263
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

236
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:19,804
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

237
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:24,054
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

238
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:27,013
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

239
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:42,971
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

240
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:45,013
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

241
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:47,138
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

242
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,138
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

243
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,305
You have to turn yourself out.

244
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:09,929
And this is one of the reasons why

245
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,929
people are very hot-tempered.

246
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:23,096
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

247
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,971
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

248
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:32,263
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

249
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:40,846
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

250
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:45,888
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

251
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:53,013
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

252
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:56,096
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

253
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:57,305
tomorrow you become a devil –

254
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:05,013
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

255
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:17,054
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

256
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:20,180
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

257
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:26,888
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

258
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:40,929
And that’s what will mature you.

259
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:51,221
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

260
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,346
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

261
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:57,763
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

262
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,846
who are innocent, simple people?

263
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:09,888
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

264
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:16,013
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

265
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:19,221
you really lag in the action of it.

266
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:24,346
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

267
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:26,346
it’s like that, something happens to you.

268
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,180
All the time you go on pinching people

269
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,929
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

270
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,888
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

271
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:42,305
And then end up in the divorce case.

272
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,346
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

273
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,846
I must tell you a very interesting story.

274
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:53,346
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

275
00:25:53,763 --> 00:25:55,138
kissing each other all the time,

276
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,096
least bothered there are other people

277
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,054
who are also going on the same escalator.

278
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:04,013
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

279
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:07,263
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

280
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:10,929
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

281
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:19,305
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

282
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,929
They were not kissing.

283
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:24,054
I said, “What happened?”

284
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,846
“We are divorced.”

285
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:30,846
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

286
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:34,180
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

287
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:36,804
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

288
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:42,929
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

289
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:47,929
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

290
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,096
All the time quarrelling with each other,

291
00:26:54,138 --> 00:27:01,305
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

292
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:06,971
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

293
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:11,888
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

294
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:14,221
that you should never show your emotions outside.

295
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:18,804
But otherwise you can show anything else,

296
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:23,804
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

297
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,180
What an absurd place it is.

298
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,971
You have accepted all these values

299
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,221
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

300
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:49,763
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

301
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:51,971
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

302
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:56,054
I will never go to these psychologists.”

303
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:57,804
So I said, “Why?”

304
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:00,221
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

305
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,221
Imagine.

306
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,138
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

307
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:19,013
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

308
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:20,888
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

309
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:28,263
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

310
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:31,305
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

311
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:39,971
But there’s a real objection now,

312
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:42,221
that people when they go abroad,

313
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,846
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

314
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:47,763
and tease each other. What is the need?

315
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,180
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

316
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:59,263
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

317
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:04,013
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

318
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:08,971
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

319
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,763
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

320
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:15,096
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

321
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:22,971
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

322
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:29,929
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

323
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:32,804
whatever you have lost, you can.

324
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:36,054
That’s why the depth is lacking.

325
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:46,096
And this is the reason there is no consistency

326
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:50,971
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

327
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,221
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

328
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,846
and next day not even one, all lost.

329
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:05,180
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

330
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:11,763
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

331
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:18,346
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

332
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:22,846
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

333
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:28,138
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

334
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:42,096
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

335
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:44,138
“that you wear such and such dress,”

336
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:50,846
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

337
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:53,888
I can keep the whole night awake,

338
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:56,305
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

339
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:03,263
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

340
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:10,305
You have everything within you.

341
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:16,096
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

342
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:21,096
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

343
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:27,763
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

344
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:32,804
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

345
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:35,054
I’m here to tell you all about it.

346
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:38,180
You are so fortunate I am with you.

347
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:40,305
Do you understand that point?

348
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:44,305
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

349
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:47,180
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

350
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,346
You don’t have to do anything like that.

351
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:57,804
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

352
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:04,054
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

353
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:08,096
in the open they used to sit for hours together

354
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:13,054
Now that’s not necessary.

355
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:18,096
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

356
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:26,180
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

357
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:33,971
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

358
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:40,263
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

359
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,263
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

360
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:48,138
I told that “You better do some course.”

361
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,305
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

362
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:56,013
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

363
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:59,804
and do it up and finish it.

364
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:03,804
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

365
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:12,846
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

366
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:24,054
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

367
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:29,013
we start moving towards that more and more,

368
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:32,263
more and more and establishing ourselves

369
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:35,263
in the ocean of that joy.

370
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:41,846
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

371
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:46,138
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

372
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:49,096
you are very happy on the gross shore,

373
00:33:49,138 --> 00:33:53,138
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

374
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,929
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

375
00:33:55,971 --> 00:34:01,013
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

376
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,305
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

377
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:07,888
regularly, religiously.

378
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:15,138
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

379
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

380
00:34:21,221 --> 00:34:25,180
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

381
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,929
And you know what mire is,

382
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:35,138
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

383
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:38,096
to come out of the water.

384
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:41,971
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

385
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:48,971
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

386
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:52,804
If you kick it, you go deeper.

387
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:55,763
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

388
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:59,846
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

389
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:04,221
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

390
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:07,888
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

391
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:10,804
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

392
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,180
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

393
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,763
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

394
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:22,013
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

395
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:25,888
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

396
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:34,888
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

397
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,054
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

398
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:48,138
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

399
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:50,929
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

400
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:54,804
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

401
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:57,180
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

402
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

403
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,888
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

404
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:03,221
The reason is, why it is said,

405
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:05,929
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

406
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:08,263
who is the Mother Earth,

407
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,305
who acts through Mother Earth.

408
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:16,221
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

409
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:21,180
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

410
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,804
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

411
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:33,138
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

412
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:37,763
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

413
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:41,138
Just see the Mother Earth.

414
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:53,346
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

415
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:57,096
and compassion has done so much for us,

416
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:59,971
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

417
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:08,096
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

418
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:14,346
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

419
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:19,346
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

420
00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:23,846
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

421
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:27,971
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

422
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:38,138
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

423
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:44,096
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

424
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:47,180
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

425
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:51,763
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

426
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:01,138
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

427
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,054
who always tries to amuse you,

428
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:07,054
always tries to say nice things,

429
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:12,763
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

430
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:21,054
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

431
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:27,054
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

432
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:35,221
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

433
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:42,804
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

434
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:44,888
just see and watch.

435
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:49,221
How they come round with little-little hands,

436
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,305
how they work it out.

437
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,096
How they know what is the right thing.

438
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:01,929
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

439
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:04,138
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

440
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:10,138
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

441
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:16,096
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

442
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:19,763
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

443
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:24,804
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

444
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:28,971
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

445
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:31,929
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

446
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:33,888
what you do know about my Grandmother?

447
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:36,305
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

448
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:39,096
and you put Her sari on the ground.

449
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:46,971
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

450
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:51,096
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

451
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:54,929
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

452
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:58,846
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

453
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:13,013
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

454
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:22,221
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

455
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:26,180
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

456
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:29,804
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

457
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,929
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

458
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,346
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

459
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,763
Because again, again the same thing.

460
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:44,804
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

461
00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:50,054
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

462
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,888
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

463
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:55,138
the same restlessness within themselves.

464
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,221
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

465
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:08,763
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

466
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:11,221
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

467
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,263
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

468
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,054
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

469
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,971
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

470
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:22,846
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

471
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:32,096
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

472
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:35,763
but some of them I can tell you,

473
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:41,846
that there were three of them,

474
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:51,221
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

475
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,263
about twelve o’clock on a road.

476
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:02,096
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

477
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:08,888
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

478
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:11,138
because where should we go and stay?”

479
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,305
I was amazed. These are the people

480
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:18,971
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

481
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:22,180
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

482
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,346
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

483
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:28,096
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

484
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,971
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

485
00:42:30,971 --> 00:42:35,180
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

486
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,305
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

487
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:42,305
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

488
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:46,305
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

489
00:42:54,013 --> 00:43:01,221
And the negative within us disappears

490
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:04,180
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

491
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:11,971
You can see it so clearly in another person.

492
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:16,804
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

493
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,804
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

494
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,888
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

495
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:24,763
very nice person, very nice person”.

496
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:33,346
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

497
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:37,888
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

498
00:43:37,888 --> 00:43:42,846
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

499
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:49,971
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

500
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:53,346
Even if you get your Realization,

501
00:43:53,763 --> 00:44:00,263
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

502
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,221
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

503
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:07,138
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

504
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:16,096
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

505
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:18,305
it can never give the right picture.

506
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:24,763
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

507
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:29,263
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

508
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,263
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

509
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:43,138
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

510
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,846
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

511
00:44:45,846 --> 00:44:48,804
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

512
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,138
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

513
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,846
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

514
00:44:57,888 --> 00:44:59,346
then they want to have this.

515
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:04,054
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

516
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:07,888
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

517
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:16,054
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

518
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:18,763
and have come out and have spread light,

519
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:26,804
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

520
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:28,346
I’ve seen people like that.

521
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,763
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

522
00:45:36,763 --> 00:45:40,263
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

523
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:50,013
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

524
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:53,138
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

525
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:59,305
Let that be awakened within you.

526
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:04,763
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

527
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:11,763
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

528
00:46:11,804 --> 00:46:16,888
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

529
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:22,263
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

530
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:25,096
At least you should have the taste of it.

531
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,096
I’m telling you about something

532
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:34,096
which you may not have heard before.

533
00:46:34,096 --> 00:46:36,846
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

534
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:40,929
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

535
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:47,263
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

536
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:52,263
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

537
00:46:52,305 --> 00:46:57,221
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

538
00:46:57,221 --> 00:47:03,221
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

539
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:08,763
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

540
00:47:08,804 --> 00:47:13,929
without the right time in Rome,

541
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:19,180
which is one of the basic things

542
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,013
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

543
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:29,763
Romans started it and others carried on.

544
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:43,804
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

545
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:47,221
But the English must know

546
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:53,888
that they have got such a golden land

547
00:47:53,929 --> 00:48:00,305
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

548
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:07,180
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

549
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:13,971
where even water beads also the snow –

550
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:17,180
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

551
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:22,888
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

552
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:27,804
Who washes the feet of His Father.

553
00:48:30,263 --> 00:48:35,763
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

554
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:43,346
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

555
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:49,221
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

556
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,763
Just the opposite English were.

557
00:48:57,013 --> 00:49:02,138
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

558
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:12,971
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

559
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:16,221
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

560
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:27,013
All unchaste people are arrogant.

561
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:31,054
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

562
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,180
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

563
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,346
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

564
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:42,929
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

565
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:58,221
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

566
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:03,846
And such a person also becomes insular

567
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:09,763
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

568
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:17,096
But a chaste personality is open,

569
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:19,846
why should he be afraid of anyone?

570
00:50:22,138 --> 00:50:24,888
Talks to everyone nicely,

571
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:29,888
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

572
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:33,221
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

573
00:50:44,763 --> 00:50:52,346
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

574
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:58,054
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

575
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,138
you’ll be thrown away.

576
00:51:09,096 --> 00:51:15,763
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

577
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:19,971
because I reside within you as chastity.

578
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:27,346
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

579
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:31,054
I reside within you as chastity.

580
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,305
Chastity is never aggressive,

581
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:42,804
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

582
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:49,263
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

583
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:51,971
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

584
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,263
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

585
00:51:54,305 --> 00:52:01,180
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

586
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:11,096
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

587
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,054
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

588
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:24,221
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

589
00:52:24,263 --> 00:52:29,763
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

590
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:32,013
for these two years, very hard,

591
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:35,013
real tapasya we have to go into,

592
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:42,888
all of us, whether men or women.

593
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:51,305
And then we’ll see.

594
00:52:53,846 --> 00:53:01,096
I can say that, we have done good job,

595
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:09,929
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

596
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:12,846
Have faith in yourself.

597
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:24,763
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

598
00:53:28,763 --> 00:53:32,346
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

599
00:53:37,054 --> 00:53:40,096
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

600
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:43,221
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

601
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,013
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

602
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,804
Why should you have faith in your wife?

603
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,888
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

604
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:57,221
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

605
00:53:57,263 --> 00:54:00,180
how can your child be anything else?

606
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:08,846
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

607
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:15,221
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

608
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:23,263
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

609
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:28,763
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

610
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:36,054
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

611
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:39,221
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

612
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:41,804
in anything.

613
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:46,180
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

614
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:48,138
that you are emotionally attached to Me

615
00:54:48,138 --> 00:54:50,346
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

616
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:56,138
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

617
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,096
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

618
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:02,804
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

619
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:11,263
Faith is something, which is volatile

620
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:19,971
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

621
00:55:22,846 --> 00:55:27,763
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

622
00:55:27,763 --> 00:55:30,346
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

623
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:39,180
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

624
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:47,971
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

625
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:55,929
Can you believe it? What a power.

626
00:56:01,888 --> 00:56:06,929
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

627
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:13,888
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

628
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:21,929
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

629
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:27,763
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

630
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:30,305
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

631
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:32,929
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

632
00:56:34,138 --> 00:56:37,971
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

633
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:39,888
who are austere, not that.

634
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:45,929
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

635
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:56,971
which acts because it understands Me.

636
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:59,763
She understands Me. She knows Me,

637
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:02,263
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

638
00:57:04,846 --> 00:57:08,888
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

639
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:15,180
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

640
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,763
Don’t waste your energy like this;

641
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,888
you are saints, live like saints.

642
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:30,013
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

643
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:34,138
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

644
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,346
something absurd, nonsensical.

645
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,263
We don’t have to attract anyone.

646
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:44,971
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

647
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:49,013
which attracts the bees,

648
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,221
is the honey of the flower,

649
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:56,971
is the essence of our existence.

650
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:11,096
So this time you are all coming to India,

651
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:19,013
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

652
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:25,305
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

653
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:27,346
and the films and all that nonsense.

654
00:58:27,346 --> 00:58:29,804
You are above all that.

655
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:46,221
Attention, achievements are to be seen

656
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:52,846
from the seat of your chastity.

657
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:57,054
We can’t leave our seats,

658
00:58:57,804 --> 00:59:00,888
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

659
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:02,180
We can’t leave our seat.

660
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:06,138
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

661
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,221
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

662
00:59:09,263 --> 00:59:19,846
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

663
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:29,346
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

664
00:59:30,763 --> 00:59:36,305
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

665
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:38,804
that you have acquired will drop out.

666
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:40,346
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

667
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:49,180
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

668
00:59:53,138 --> 00:59:57,013
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

669
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:06,305
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

670
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:14,138
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

671
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:21,346
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

672
01:00:24,138 --> 01:00:27,346
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

673
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:37,763
And when you worship Him, you must realize

674
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:41,804
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

675
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:46,763
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

676
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,929
you should abhor such a person.

677
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:55,013
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

678
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:57,180
just have nothing to do with that person.

679
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:07,846
Christ is innocence.

680
01:01:10,929 --> 01:01:14,013
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

681
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:18,054
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

682
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:28,221
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

683
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:30,305
so that you never recognize Him.

684
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:44,138
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

685
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:49,138
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

686
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:54,305
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

687
01:01:54,346 --> 01:01:56,846
Try to be meditative. See things.

688
01:01:56,846 --> 01:02:00,054
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

689
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:12,138
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

690
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:20,263
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

691
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:24,054
if possible day after tomorrow evening

692
01:02:26,096 --> 01:02:33,221
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

693
01:02:34,804 --> 01:02:47,929
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

694
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:50,221
I really work very hard,

695
01:02:50,263 --> 01:02:53,096
you have no idea how much I work hard.

696
01:02:53,138 --> 01:02:57,971
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

697
01:02:57,971 --> 01:03:00,305
that others should do all their work.

698
01:03:01,305 --> 01:03:04,846
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

699
01:03:04,888 --> 01:03:10,221
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

700
01:03:10,263 --> 01:03:13,180
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

701
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:14,971
She should do meditation.

702
01:03:20,846 --> 01:03:23,221
There is no saving.

703
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:29,096
You can save everything else if you just know

704
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:35,846
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

705
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,929
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

706
01:03:40,138 --> 01:03:42,263
But first save yourself.

707
01:03:44,305 --> 01:03:48,929
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

708
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,305
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

709
01:03:54,346 --> 01:04:00,180
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

710
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,888
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

711
01:04:03,888 --> 01:04:06,305
Everyone can work it out.

712
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:09,763
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

713
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,305
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

714
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:17,138
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

715
01:04:19,846 --> 01:04:21,929
I am thankful that all the people

716
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:25,013
have come from all over England.

717
01:04:26,054 --> 01:04:28,221
It was right thing to do it in a way,

718
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:34,346
but this country must be created of that level

719
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:38,888
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

720
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:44,804
On the contrary it should not happen

721
01:04:44,846 --> 01:04:46,180
that once they come to England,

722
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:48,180
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

723
01:04:49,096 --> 01:04:57,305
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

724
01:04:57,305 --> 01:05:01,096
that people have may be that it might become like that,

725
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:03,305
that once they come here they’ll say,

726
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:05,888
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

727
01:05:08,346 --> 01:05:12,263
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

728
01:05:13,846 --> 01:05:17,305
I have known some people that they came to England

729
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:20,221
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

730
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:24,054
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

731
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:25,180
“Mother nothing doing,

732
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,888
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

733
01:05:27,888 --> 01:05:31,804
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

734
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,888
where you have worked for twelve years.”

735
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:44,846
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

736
01:05:46,138 --> 01:05:51,180
and we have certain debts to be paid,

737
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:55,221
to be born in this country,

738
01:05:56,846 --> 01:06:02,221
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

739
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:09,138
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

740
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:13,929
When you say that, “shut that window,”

741
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,929
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

742
01:06:17,971 --> 01:06:21,346
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

743
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:32,221
Make others work is not the way.

744
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:35,054
You have to be really very dedicated.

745
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:38,846
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

746
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:42,054
Don’t look at other people who are here.

747
01:06:42,054 --> 01:06:44,929
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

748
01:06:47,763 --> 01:06:55,305
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

749
01:06:55,305 --> 01:06:58,929
and that you have a special responsibility.

750
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:06,263
So may God bless you.

751
01:07:56,263 --> 01:08:00,971
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

752
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:06,804
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

753
01:08:07,763 --> 01:08:11,263
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

754
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:14,013
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

755
01:08:15,846 --> 01:08:20,388
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

756
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:29,763
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

757
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:35,138
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

758
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:41,305
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

759
01:08:44,263 --> 01:08:54,221
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

760
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:57,971
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

761
01:09:03,221 --> 01:09:09,138
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

762
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:17,013
Through your punyas it should be.

763
01:09:17,929 --> 01:09:33,263
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

764
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:37,221
through your punyas only.

765
01:09:45,054 --> 01:09:51,846
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

766
01:09:52,929 --> 01:09:57,013
The people who have to worship, we have to see

767
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:59,804
who are the people who have to worship.

768
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:05,013
Very difficult situation.

769
01:10:40,096 --> 01:10:44,138
Get the small children, that’s the best.

770
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:47,971
Come along. Nira. Come along.

771
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:57,888
Yes, yes you both come along.

772
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:09,221
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

773
01:11:28,971 --> 01:11:32,054
All of them should be below ten years.

774
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:48,054
Not below two but below ten.

775
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:51,054
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

776
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:15,929
Very good children, must say.

777
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:18,013
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

778
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:24,846
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

779
01:12:24,846 --> 01:12:28,013
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

780
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:30,263
and you just have to rub. Alright.

781
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,846
Come along, four at the time.

782
01:12:32,846 --> 01:12:34,221
Now who are the four?

783
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:37,929
She will put the water,

784
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:41,054
you rub, now you rub It,

785
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:43,929
you rub My Foot.
