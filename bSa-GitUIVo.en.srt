00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,240
Sahasrara Puja Evening Talk. Thredbo (Australia) 3 May 1987.

2
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:55,521
I hope today’s lecture did not shock you very much.

3
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,801
I had to tell you about it,

4
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,973
otherwise you would not know your importance,

5
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:09,838
your greatness, your responsibilities.

6
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:20,546
But I must warn you about the ghost as I told you,

7
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:23,077
because a mother has to warn about the ghost

8
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:28,652
to frighten the children, that’s important;

9
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:35,874
and the ghost is materialism, as I
said, which has become so important.

10
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:44,933
Matter always tries to overpower the spirit, all the time.

11
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:50,847
All the habits are formed because of the matter.

12
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:54,472
Even the habits of drinking, say, habits of taking drugs

13
00:04:54,672 --> 00:05:03,683
is nothing but these horrible, powerful material things

14
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:09,588
which are dead are trying to overpower us.

15
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:21,606
The spirit is paramount, it is the highest thing.

16
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:25,491
Nothing can reach it.

17
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:36,545
It keeps you away from all the skirmishes,

18
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:48,454
all the cheap and superficial problems of the world.

19
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:56,056
Materialism has grown much more today than ever before.

20
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,024
It has become very important for people

21
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:04,329
to worry about things that they possess.

22
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:11,673
I find in the West it has grown so subtly and so sophisticatedly

23
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:19,619
that it is difficult even to find out
how far we have gone with it.

24
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:29,190
It’s like plastic, which can penetrate
into everything and can hold it.

25
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:38,470
This materialism has brought us to the cracking point now,

26
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,055
the whole world is bothered about it.

27
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:46,999
First of all there are ecological imbalances.

28
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,030
People are watching the trees are dying out,

29
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,723
because factories are being created out of proportion,

30
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:59,926
and the factories need all the time something to be fed into them;

31
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:15,613
and they go on and on and on, creating
things which are not so much necessary.

32
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:26,752
As I told you, it’s a play of the evil
forces which is very much collective.

33
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:32,466
Say for a factory starts,

34
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:37,283
then clothes are made, for example,

35
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:48,521
then there’s an entrepreneur who comes
forward to make the clothes to be sold out.

36
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:56,688
Now he is the one who changes, he
starts changing the forms of the clothes

37
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:02,047
in such a way that every year, new lot comes out of that machine,

38
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,199
and everybody has pile of clothes in the house,

39
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,090
they don’t know what to do with it. These are last year’s,

40
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,254
that’s before last year’s, that’s that last year’s,

41
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:22,652
of no use, absolutely useless, all made of artificial fiber.

42
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:27,796
It is hard to find anything natural in all the Western countries

43
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:31,804
wherever I have been, anything that is cotton,

44
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:36,429
anything that is pure silk.

45
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,808
There should be some balance that machines are for us,

46
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:45,697
we are not for the machines.

47
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:50,791
Then new types of machines are coming out now

48
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:57,094
to befool the people,

49
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:03,102
to take advantage of their stupidity I should say,

50
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:07,746
and change one after another things,

51
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,707
as creating fashions.

52
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:13,598
As I’m told in America,

53
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:18,901
every bathroom has a different type of a switch or a handle,

54
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,455
you don’t know which one to push.

55
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:25,566
You push one handle and you might feel you might get

56
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:31,394
all the water on top of your head, is a new style.

57
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:39,170
Now I’ve seen the bathroom that I have, it’s very interesting.

58
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:46,876
You must know horse-riding to get into it.

59
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,972
And it’s all surrounded by glass,

60
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:58,692
I mean anybody would be nervous taking bath in there;

61
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:05,114
and there are big, big holes you see, just as handles.

62
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,553
Of course these things will again go back,

63
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:12,428
because normalcy works out. Like in our body also,

64
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:18,838
if we do anything extreme we come back
to our parasympathetic which balances.

65
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:23,862
So the nature brings you back again to the same thing.

66
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:26,099
Like they said “have no marriages,”

67
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,382
then “have marriages with men.”

68
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:31,242
Men having marriages with men, women having marriages with women,

69
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,699
all kinds of nonsensical marriage systems they developed.

70
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,590
So they must have varieties, you see: “How can it be

71
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,411
that a woman should marry a man?”

72
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,551
Then an old woman marrying a very young boy,

73
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,104
or an old man marrying a very little girl,

74
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:49,253
all kinds of nonsensical things started.

75
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,647
Now it’s coming back again.

76
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:55,909
We can’t have many wives, we can’t be with many women,

77
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:58,265
we have to be married to one woman,

78
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:03,390
all those things are coming back, but at what cost?

79
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,969
We have got already a disease which is called as killer’s disease;

80
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,703
so many problems have been created by this kind

81
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:17,735
of movement towards the left or towards the right.

82
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:26,398
Before the war started it was more
the movement on the left-hand side.

83
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:31,992
All the poets wrote about something imaginary tragic,

84
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:38,633
like the Greek tragedy. I don’t know
why there should be a tragedy in Greece.

85
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,656
Itself, Greece itself is a tragedy for every one of us.

86
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:46,211
But they created a tragedy.

87
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:52,829
I mean, it’s a horrid stuff that they
have created. So everybody is miserable,

88
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,837
"Les Miserables all of them,

89
00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:00,657
and French people don’t like Me much because I’m not serious.

90
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,597
I should not laugh, I should be very serious.

91
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:09,386
When talking about God I should be even worse than a dead body,

92
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:13,798
otherwise they don’t want to listen to you.

93
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:18,111
All kinds of stupidity started that move to the left,

94
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:21,384
doing all kinds of perverse things.

95
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:24,381
When Mr. Freud came in they said, “That’s a good leader for us.

96
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:28,044
Now he’ll give us some more varieties.”

97
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:35,133
I was in a very big banquet, sitting
next to the ambassador of Mexico,

98
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,633
and he told Me that “I’m told You are against Freud completely.”

99
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,786
“Yes, I am,” I said, “Jung was a sensible man.”

100
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,980
He said, “What is in Jung? He told us what all these

101
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,570
our books have told, so what is so great about him

102
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,015
that he’s told something the same thing?

103
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,517
But Freud told us something new, so he’s great.”

104
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:56,377
I said, “All right. We have never eaten this table,

105
00:12:56,577 --> 00:13:02,210
should we eat that because it’s a new thing to do?”

106
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,277
Of course it was not very diplomatic.

107
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:16,543
Mut I did say because I couldn’t help. This kind of a funny idea:

108
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,191
“it’s a new idea, let’s have a new idea”,

109
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:22,848
any new idea, you just do it.

110
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:25,611
Now in, say, in Rome they have a new idea,

111
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:29,723
that they should wear all the things with the sequins all over.

112
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,705
Now the sequins thing you cannot wash much.

113
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,568
So today they’ll waste all their money on the sequins,

114
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:37,845
tomorrow they cannot wash it, they’ll get dirty,

115
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:42,556
so they’ll start on something else.

116
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,551
We have to be normal people as Sahaja yogis,

117
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:53,259
to understand that we’ll not allow matter to supersede us.

118
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,174
Now today just to celebrate the Sahasrara Day in full way,

119
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,995
I thought of wearing a sari with many chakras.

120
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,300
It has some symbol, it’s symbolic thing;

121
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,714
and the starry sky that you see all over,

122
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:15,472
to represent that, the blue color.

123
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:20,990
Blue color is the sign of depth. It has some symbol.

124
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,855
It’s not without any symbol, without any meaning,

125
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:28,175
that you wear anything because some factory is producing

126
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,714
these things in bulk and they must be sold.

127
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,432
We should be out of all these things. These things should not touch us,

128
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:39,502
these things should not impress us, but we should laugh at them.

129
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:42,767
"Oh, there is now a new craze has started another one",

130
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:46,422
and now they are looking like scarecrows everywhere, I find.

131
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:50,267
I mean, they can be used for that purpose very easily.

132
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:54,665
It’s terrible the way things are working out.

133
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:58,228
But the worst thing that happens with materialism,

134
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:04,921
that your attention becomes very superficial, very superficial.

135
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:11,041
You go on watching everything, you read every sign board.

136
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,702
If you have missed one you’ll turn around, “I’ve missed one,”

137
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:19,004
so you must read that. The whole attention is so superficial.

138
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,804
You are looking at women, women are looking at men,

139
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,148
men are looking at – I don’t know what they are looking at.

140
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:32,633
The attention is so stupid and so
foolish, and I have seen in their eyes

141
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,523
the bhoots are passing from one to another.

142
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:42,132
It’s absolutely evil to put your eyes to such a strain.

143
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:48,132
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes.” How many Christians there are who have,

144
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:51,691
who haven’t got adulterous eyes?

145
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:56,238
So what you find that the whole thing becomes extremely superficial,

146
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:01,526
even the religion. All religions have become anti-God,

147
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,222
these are all anti-God activities.

148
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,534
They have nothing to do with God, they have nothing to do with religion,

149
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:11,817
they have nothing to do with dharma as we call it.

150
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:17,639
They are making all kinds of advertisements

151
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,470
that they are very religious, that they believe in God,

152
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,017
that they are doing all good things.

153
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:34,541
Christ, who lived under very meager circumstances,

154
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:38,057
was born in a manger.

155
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:42,786
If you go and see the property of Pope you will be amazed and aghast.

156
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:46,252
He has more property than even the tsars had,

157
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:51,859
even the great kings of China had.

158
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:56,734
And now they are hand-in-glove with mafia,

159
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:01,201
still they are heads of the religion.

160
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,256
Same in India, the way religion is preached

161
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,279
with all nonsensical things going on.

162
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:10,424
There’s no sense in what they are talking; the Hindu religion,

163
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:14,611
the Sikh religion, and the Islamic religion is another nonsense.

164
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:18,654
It has nothing to do with God, it’s all anti-God activity.

165
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:21,060
It just forces people,

166
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,974
it just frightens people and makes them suffer,

167
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:34,522
and uses all the property, the wealth that they have.

168
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,946
What is the interest of a person who is religious

169
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:40,899
in the property of other people?

170
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,052
Why should he be interested in getting the property of another person?

171
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,743
He should not be. On the contrary he should be happy

172
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,926
to see that somebody is happy, well-off with his children,

173
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:55,543
enjoying a nice happy life.

174
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:59,773
But there’s no end to this greed. The greed is so much

175
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:04,843
that it’s impossible to call these people religious by any chance,

176
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,721
and they are the ones who are talking on religion.

177
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,627
Then the other side of it – not only the greed, the lust.

178
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:19,005
The lust is so obvious,

179
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:22,669
is so vivid

180
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:30,020
that one cannot believe that these
people have anything to do with religion.

181
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,423
So it follows with the superficiality,

182
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:36,870
once you get materialistic.

183
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:42,053
Then materialism also gives you certain ideas

184
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:46,318
that you must have legs like this, you must have nose like that,

185
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:49,474
you must have eyes like that, you must have body like that,

186
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:52,490
so everybody starts working on that.

187
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,627
In America in the morning if you get up, everybody is running on the streets,

188
00:18:56,828 --> 00:19:02,272
whether old or young. Some people
died of heart attacks on the streets.

189
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:06,994
They said now they are having a new craze, what is it called as, jogging.

190
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,498
And I had an Indian girl with Me,

191
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:12,096
and she said – she woke Me up, she said, “Mother, get up, get up!”

192
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,658
I said, “What has happened?” “Something gone wrong in this place.”

193
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:18,912
I said, “Why?” “Everybody is running.”

194
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:23,943
I said, “They are jogging.” “No, no, even old people are running.

195
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:27,304
How can it be something like that?” I said, “It is, that’s their style.

196
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:31,840
You forget it, let Me sleep!”

197
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:47,183
Everything should be done in a way
to keep fit and to keep all right,

198
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:51,948
but not just to sort of fall into the traps

199
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:56,852
of these people who are spreading materialism.

200
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,827
I told one lady – she was very thin already, and

201
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:05,046
I said, “Why are you thinning more?”

202
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,036
She said, “Because the modern clothes don’t fit you.”

203
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:11,333
So I said, “Is it? It’s that according to the modern clothes

204
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,020
you are going to make your body?” She said, “You have to,

205
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,538
otherwise how will you wear the dresses?”

206
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,499
I said, “This is horrid, absolutely horrid”,

207
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:24,593
horrid system that they force people to wear the dresses,

208
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:29,210
whatever their standards are.

209
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:38,773
It has killed all the arts, all the
hand-made things, all the real things.

210
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:43,664
It has brought everything artificial, everything superficial.

211
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:47,898
The attention is so superficial. Just now I was watching a film,

212
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:54,000
some sort of an American film: everybody was sick, everybody was mad.

213
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,000
I mean, I couldn’t understand how could any human being

214
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,242
behave like this? I have not known people like that Myself,

215
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,113
but they showed a sick man behaving

216
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:09,630
in a very sickly manner, supposed to be a hero.

217
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:17,716
All these advertisements, all these newspapers, all this media,

218
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:23,888
all of them are just here to create sensations in your body,

219
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:28,520
some sort of a sensation. It has to be a sensational thing,

220
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,497
because they think that you have become matter.

221
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:39,677
Unless and until you give some shocks to the matter, it won’t move.

222
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,531
And that is what they have brought you to,

223
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:52,293
that’s where we have landed into – a state of matter.

224
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:56,191
So we have no feelings, we just don’t talk to anyone,

225
00:21:56,391 --> 00:22:01,032
our hearts are frozen. We feel afraid to talk to human beings.

226
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:05,189
We cannot tolerate our children.

227
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,311
In London in every, every week

228
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:11,288
– in London city, not I am saying England –

229
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:15,616
they are killing two children every week.

230
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:21,053
We have no love for our children, we can’t bear our children.

231
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:25,655
We have no love for each other, no love for cooking,

232
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:28,462
no love for doing something for your husband,

233
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,392
husband has no love for doing anything for the wife.

234
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:34,962
All the time what pictures they show is husband and wife fighting,

235
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:41,461
all the time – how can there be? There’s no
love, there’s no affection, there’s no kindness.

236
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:45,430
What is the fight going on? “Why did you spoil the carpet?”

237
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,434
She said, “No, I didn’t spoil the carpet, the children spoilt it.”

238
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,438
“Then why didn’t you clean it?” The fight is on –

239
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:55,634
for what, for the carpet? What is this carpet?

240
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,587
Is it a permanent stuff? But what is important,

241
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,540
they have to sell the house tomorrow. They have to sell the house,

242
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,019
the carpet must be neat, so everything is sellable,

243
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:10,042
everything has to be sold, even the wife, husband, children, everything.

244
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,007
They have to be made in such a way they are sellable all the time.

245
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,722
Whatever you buy: you buy a diamond – all right,

246
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:20,995
it should be sellable. If you want to buy anything precious

247
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:24,988
it must be sellable, you’ll be surprised.

248
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:28,527
So nobody can have something that is not standardized.

249
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:31,948
All the rest, I don’t know, goes into waste I think in these countries.

250
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:34,297
You have to have everything standardized.

251
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,844
Nothing you can have for your own joy, for your own happiness,

252
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:45,104
for your own using, for your own love for it.

253
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:47,925
You give somebody some present, say for example

254
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,972
you give somebody a gold ring, immediately that person will go

255
00:23:52,172 --> 00:24:01,524
to the shopkeeper and ask the jeweler: "Is it gold or not?"

256
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:06,448
Whether it is, the price is all right or not,

257
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:12,581
what carat gold – everything. They will
not see to the beauty of the thing.

258
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:19,714
They will not see to the way the feelings are being expressed.

259
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,370
What they will see is whether it is sellable or not.

260
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,860
“Later on if I want to sell it, even the presents,

261
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:32,096
if I can sell it it’s better to find out.”

262
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:37,429
So the whole attitude towards life is that

263
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:44,031
everything is valued in money, everything is valued in money.

264
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:48,007
“What is the damage? How much it will cost?

265
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:53,314
How much we have to pay? How much for the child-bearing?

266
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:56,603
If you will have one child, how much it will cost?”

267
00:24:56,803 --> 00:25:02,912
Immediately they’ll go to the computer and find out how much it will cost.

268
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,775
Now, like I’m speaking so I should find out

269
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:14,462
how much it will cost My throat,

270
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:18,908
that if I’m speaking so many words, like there’s a computer for it.

271
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:21,642
You put in the computer, you’ll find out it will cost you

272
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:28,363
five lozenges. All right, charge five lozenges to the Sahaja Yogis.

273
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:41,340
There’s no feeling. Even they sing, when they walk,

274
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,223
even when they do any work there’s no feeling

275
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:46,532
and there’s no involvement at all,

276
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:50,099
no involvement of any kind.

277
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,991
The artistic work that was done before cannot be done today, why?

278
00:25:56,191 --> 00:26:00,340
It is because there is no feeling, there’s no involvement,

279
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,721
there’s no feeling that, that "this is my work, I’m doing it;

280
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:11,397
I’m doing it to present my own feelings,

281
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:18,227
to express myself, it’s my own thing". There’s no feeling.

282
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:24,117
Imagine, you have seen, so many of you have seen now Ajanta.

283
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:29,649
This was built in ten centuries, cut from top to bottom.

284
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,845
How they must have planned it? How they must have organized

285
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:35,438
among themselves in ten generations?

286
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:39,344
How they must have painted it? And there’s nothing,

287
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:45,133
no city, nothing, no television, no food. How they lived there?

288
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:52,725
They lived on dedication and love of Buddha, whom they had never seen.

289
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:59,025
Such personalities they were, such involvement.

290
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:06,080
Once they took up something they were absolutely dedicated with it.

291
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,913
But such people are lost today because of materialism.

292
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:13,515
Most important thing is how much money you get out of everything,

293
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:19,023
there’s no end to it. And then what you take to is thieving.

294
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,273
All these big, big people, the prime minister,

295
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:27,398
today I was told that this Marcos, the great prime minister,

296
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:35,473
Filipino fellow gave all his paintings to another thief from Riyad.

297
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,716
They’re all thieves.

298
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:43,624
All these big, big johnnies supposed to be there are thieves.

299
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,556
Why? What are they lacking? What are they afraid of? Why do they do that?

300
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:54,247
They are afraid that they’ll be
found out that they are thieves,

301
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:56,990
so they are doing all these wrong things.

302
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,458
They are collecting money because they know they have to run away one day.

303
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:04,401
All right, so they must organize in such a way

304
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:07,466
that they should have all these things planted in some place

305
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:11,310
where they can always get hold of.

306
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,013
But why become the thief first of all?

307
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:17,368
You become the prime minister, make a name out of yourself,

308
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:22,720
your history will remember you. No,
they cannot think of those things,

309
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,927
they just think of the present.

310
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:31,117
Sahaj way! It’s to make money.

311
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:36,039
"When you are on the throne, make the money as much as is possible."

312
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,427
This money is going to bring them bad name.

313
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:42,443
In the progeny they will not be remembered,

314
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:45,576
people will not take their names. If they take their names,

315
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:50,836
they will have a headache. So what’s
the use of leading such a life?

316
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:56,908
Even today human beings in general are not so degenerated

317
00:28:57,108 --> 00:29:00,721
that they put statues of a drunkard

318
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:04,666
or statues of a man who has been a thief,

319
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:10,824
who has been managing the whole country
and selling it off to somebody else.

320
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:16,785
There are no statues of such people. Nobody remembers them.

321
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:22,787
People don’t like them, such people are hated.

322
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:29,747
And even if there are statues of such people – I’ve seen that of Stalin –

323
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:34,392
they remove them.

324
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:44,644
So this idea of materialism has grown like a ghost now

325
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:50,681
into the minds of people, that matter is more important;

326
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:56,779
that materially if you are all right, you are all right.

327
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:04,711
The other side of it is that you must
show that you don’t care for matter,

328
00:30:04,911 --> 00:30:08,982
that you are not bothered, like these anti-culture people.

329
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:13,951
But no, materialism is within them, it is engrained in them,

330
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:18,536
it’s in their blood, they can’t get out of it.

331
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:22,614
By showing off that "we make our hair in such a manner

332
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:26,341
that we don’t need a barber",

333
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:31,367
or else "we dress up with dirty clothes with holes in it

334
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:36,539
to show that we don’t care for matter", it’s not so.

335
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:42,311
By changing the matter you do not change the inside within yourself.

336
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:48,495
Inside is changed when you look at the matter as a witness.

337
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,790
Matter has a purpose. You should
know the purpose of the matter.

338
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,815
If you know the purpose of the matter then you have value,

339
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:03,011
your value system is correct. For example, this has its own purpose:

340
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:08,511
it has a purpose that it must deliver the lecture properly.

341
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:12,624
But if this purpose is not served, it is no good.

342
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:15,734
In the same way everything has a purpose.

343
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:21,961
What’s the use of buying fifty artificial blouses,

344
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:29,913
or thirty-two thousand shoes as this lady had, Mrs. Marcos,

345
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:34,397
when she’s not going to use even two out of them?

346
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:38,295
It has no feeling, it has no meaning, it’s selfishness,

347
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:44,704
it’s self-centeredness. It’s thinking about yourself all the time.

348
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:49,779
Now you want to give Me a sari.

349
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:52,834
In Marathi it is called as “pot zakaych,”

350
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:58,865
means they’re covering the womb of the
Goddess, the stomach of the Mother.

351
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:03,047
Because She’s put us there, She has given us birth,

352
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:06,649
so we must give Her something to cover it,

353
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,182
is a very humble way of saying it.

354
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:13,791
Now you give Me a sari,

355
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:18,158
I don’t know when I’m going to wear all these, but whatever it is,

356
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:21,374
just give Me a sari with a feeling,

357
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:26,983
and maybe I may never wear it, I may wear it also.

358
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:32,516
But the progeny will see what you have given to your Mother.

359
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,402
I’m not going to carry it with Me, nobody’s going to carry the matter with them.

360
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:42,264
But it had a purpose, it had a
meaning, it had emotions behind it.

361
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:46,545
It was given in a puja when so many people gathered,

362
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:51,006
you gave to your Mother. When people
will see it they’ll be so very happy,

363
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:54,092
“Oh, the Sydney people gave this,”

364
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:58,217
or “the Australians gave on this Sahasrara Day.”

365
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:02,257
See, even the vibrations flow.

366
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,163
Just that, this is what it is.

367
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:12,746
Now, it has no purpose if you put something up

368
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:17,606
in a puja which is not necessary.

369
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:21,369
It has no purpose at all, it has no feeling,

370
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,408
it has no meaning. It is valueless.

371
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:31,755
For example if you put this up, say, into My bathroom, it is useless.

372
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,784
Specially this one,

373
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:43,304
because I can’t even sing there.

374
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:49,956
Quite frightening. Thank God it’s being screened

375
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:53,796
by Sahaja yogis because they know My conditions, you see,

376
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:57,734
but it’s so sweet to see the way they have covered it,

377
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,952
because they know their Mother would be quite nervous

378
00:34:00,152 --> 00:34:05,818
to have a bath in a glass bathroom.

379
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:09,498
That’s all. That shows, you see, that feeling,

380
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:13,689
that understanding about Me. That fills My heart

381
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:21,146
with such love, such oneness with you
that you understand Me,

382
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:25,395
that "Mother may not like, you see, this kind of a glass business."

383
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:29,684
It’s so sweet to do those things for Me.

384
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:33,567
Little, little things here and there, whatever we do for others

385
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:39,606
are so suggestive of our love, of our feelings.

386
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:45,103
And this is what you have to express today, not the materialism.

387
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,860
We don’t have to express that, that we were very rich people

388
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,767
or that we had lots of diamonds and we had ornaments, nothing.

389
00:34:56,967 --> 00:35:02,001
That is not needed. No, we were people of great feelings.

390
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:09,742
What they brought for Christ was leaves of palm, palm tree;

391
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:16,281
singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” like the way you were singing today.

392
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,223
What these palm trees are? Even today they are remembered.

393
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:30,713
They’ll be remembered eternally, the
palm trees that were used for this.

394
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:36,779
They didn’t think about it, they
didn’t know what to get at that time.

395
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:39,474
Whatever was available they got it,

396
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:44,046
and started singing “Hosanna, hosanna!” to Christ.

397
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:48,405
All these little, little things become so important,

398
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,016
because you have given value to it.

399
00:35:52,216 --> 00:36:02,346
A little piece, a little clay if you take and put art into it,

400
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:06,198
put your feelings into it, then that becomes expensive.

401
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:12,194
Even economics can show that it has become more expensive.

402
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:20,436
But if you give with feelings and if
you give it to someone with your love,

403
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:30,128
even that adds to the value; to that person it’s very valuable.

404
00:36:36,432 --> 00:36:43,102
It is remarkable sometimes how little things

405
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:48,071
just move the whole ocean of My love

406
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:54,551
into a turbulent, happy, joyous, loving heart.

407
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:59,426
I sometimes feel that how these little things that they do

408
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:04,019
and care for Me, express their love,

409
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:11,024
just moves Me to the highest point of joy.

410
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:17,646
Then it’s not the matter that is important,

411
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:21,805
it’s not how much you have spent is important,

412
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:27,212
it’s not how it has been brought is important.

413
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:31,501
What is important is how much thought you have given to it;

414
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:36,626
and that is what is lacking, that there is no thought.

415
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:41,522
We think, but we do not give thought – it’s two things,

416
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:45,557
different. We just go on thinking, thinking, doing nothing.

417
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:51,897
And to give a thought to a thing
is a sign of depth and understanding.

418
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:58,014
When the matter is given thought, then it becomes important.

419
00:37:58,214 --> 00:38:03,035
Without the thought it is useless, it is sellable all the time,

420
00:38:03,235 --> 00:38:07,106
everything is sellable.

421
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:10,902
It has no meaning, it has no value.

422
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:14,720
I hope you will all get out of this ghost,

423
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,049
and get out of the clutches of these
entrepreneurs who are trying to ruin you.

424
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:28,429
Try to have things which are full of feelings,

425
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:32,958
which are having some meaning,

426
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:41,099
and also try to give it to others things which can express your love.

427
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:48,403
Matter has one great value, that through
matter you can express your love,

428
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:52,948
you can express your feelings for a person.

429
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:58,152
Now today at the last minute I was just struggling to get

430
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:00,972
some presents for you;

431
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,220
I mean, it was such a struggle, you can’t imagine.

432
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,580
I was in a big mess there,

433
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,982
the house was in a mess and all kinds of things happening,

434
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,951
the puja in the morning.

435
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:21,639
Until about twelve o’clock I could not leave Pune.

436
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,600
So there was no question of buying anything in Bombay.

437
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,421
So I had to do in a very short time

438
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:33,852
through other people’s help some sort of purchases,

439
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:36,914
and I’ve been able to buy some few things for you,

440
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:41,797
so please accept them as a token of My love for you.

441
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,978
Moreover I’ve brought some mangoes, quite a lot of them,

442
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:52,009
and this your custom authorities have taken them away.

443
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,325
I was very unhappy and they could see that.

444
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,919
I said, “What’s this, are you going to eat these mangoes?”

445
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,181
They said, “No, we are going to fumigate.”

446
00:39:59,382 --> 00:40:01,512
I said, “After fumigation you give it to us,

447
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:06,168
for My children I’ve brought.” So they understood it and they agreed.

448
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,640
So I hope we get the mangoes for you on Monday.

449
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,017
After all it’s a small thing, but after all

450
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:18,778
this is the time for you to eat mangoes.

451
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,200
Have you got the presents here? ….

452
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:56,527
So I have left it to James’ wisdom to name them for people

453
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,597
whom he wanted to give the presents,

454
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:04,975
and we have smuggled them nicely into your country.

455
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:12,866
Because we had a mango problem, they allowed us to bring the rest of it!
