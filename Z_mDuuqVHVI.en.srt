1
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:23,133
I am immensely joyous to see you all here.

2
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:34,793
I do not know what to say from my side.

3
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:40,093
The words get lost, they have no meaning.

4
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:56,103
So many of you are aspiring to ascend to that
state where you would have complete joy, bliss

5
00:00:56,103 --> 00:01:00,512
and peace.

6
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:04,993
This is what I could give you.

7
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:12,433
And a mother is only happy when she can give
whatever she has to her children.

8
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:27,573
Her unhappiness, all her restlessness, everything
is just to achieve that end – to gift all

9
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:32,243
that she has.

10
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:43,443
I don’t know how much to thank you people
to go through all this to get to that treasure

11
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:49,723
that you have within yourself.

12
00:01:49,723 --> 00:02:05,533
‘Sahaj’ is the only word I could think
[of] when I started to manifest Sahastrara

13
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,023
opening.

14
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:15,442
That’s easily understood by everyone so
far.

15
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:25,043
But you have realised that it is today a different
style of yoga where first enlightenment is

16
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:29,642
given and then you are allowed to look after
yourself.

17
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:32,562
It was never done before.

18
00:02:32,562 --> 00:03:10,663
It’s just a venture of your Mother which
has worked out.

19
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:31,512
Otherwise, in the olden times the concern
of Divine was to get people enlightened and

20
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:36,702
It did not know how to work it out.

21
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:44,633
No incarnation ever tried to work it out in
this fashion.

22
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:58,752
But whenever they tried, they tried to have
a very severe hardship for the seekers – very

23
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,342
severe hardships.

24
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:09,163
I wonder how many of you have read the treatise
of Buddha, when he used to travel with thousand

25
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:12,352
of his disciples – not giving Realisation.

26
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:23,532
They were not Realised-souls, without feeling
any joy around; with two clothes, living in

27
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,963
the jungles.

28
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:29,133
Just two clothes!

29
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:35,353
And the area where he visited, which I have
seen myself, is terribly cold, chilly, absolutely

30
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:36,353
chilly.

31
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:43,923
And the clothes were not clothes actually,
it was cloth covering their body.

32
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:56,173
Sleeping on the open ground in very severe
winter or maybe in summer.

33
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:00,553
Without any shoes they were asked to walk,
for miles together, miles together!

34
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:06,243
If you go and see where Buddha has walked
and trodden, you will be surprised!

35
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:11,153
Buddha was also young – he used to walk.

36
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:16,793
But his disciples used to walk much more because
he would go and station at one place.

37
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,363
He would send his disciples.

38
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:24,213
There was no time to advertise or to announce
anything.

39
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:31,123
So he used to stay in one place, and the disciples
used to go around the villages, ask for bhiksha

40
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:40,803
– meaning the ‘alms’ – to gather some
food from the villages; cook one time, give

41
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:42,743
part of it to Buddha.

42
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:50,973
And rest of that they used to eat.

43
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:56,003
They would go, work out, get people from all
the villages, whatever was possible and would

44
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:59,853
bring them to Buddha for sermon.

45
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:01,623
Such sacrifices!

46
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:10,493
They have lived in huts, caves, in terrible
darkness, meditating.

47
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:14,923
But they never got Realisation.

48
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:19,363
Very few got their Realisation.

49
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:31,793
They were people who were sons of great kings,
and princes, dukes, duchesses – all very,

50
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:35,763
very rich people.

51
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:43,933
Woman of very rich families followed him.

52
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:55,073
And they walked for miles together with him
in the thorny routes; because they felt that

53
00:06:55,073 --> 00:07:05,793
Buddha’s work was of such universal importance,
that they are the part and parcel of such

54
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:16,833
a tremendous task; that they should be taking
part in such a great work for humanity.

55
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:27,563
This is not only in India, but even Viditama
who started the Zen system in Japan.

56
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:33,333
In China, I was surprised, the amount of sacrifices
the saints had made, the way they lived!

57
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:37,993
I mean if you see the way they were living
– in the conditions – you cannot imagine!

58
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:46,673
And they ended up their lives like that, working
it out.

59
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:51,013
Without any proper guidance because Buddha
had died – there was no way out.

60
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,153
They had to find their own ways.

61
00:07:53,153 --> 00:08:00,143
Then they found mahayan and shvetayan – all
kind of things.

62
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:05,663
Even if you see other seekers in other religions
– like at the time of Christ – where did

63
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:07,653
they live?

64
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:14,083
And after the death of Christ it was even
worse because they were persecuted, they were

65
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:18,713
killed, they were tortured, crucified!

66
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:28,603
It happened with Moses also – his disciples
were hounded so they had to all run towards

67
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:29,603
India.

68
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,123
Imagine the distances!

69
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:40,722
From that area to Kashmir – how they must
have walked, how they must have lived, how

70
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,392
they must have carried.

71
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:48,592
And in thousands, in thousands they came,
to India.

72
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:56,123
Because they realised that they are doing
a tremendous task.

73
00:08:56,123 --> 00:09:00,593
Something so great that they are supporting.

74
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:05,332
In this country we had a struggle of freedom.

75
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,012
I was part and parcel of that.

76
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,572
My parents were part and parcel of that.

77
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:14,132
They were rich people, quite rich I should
say, from every standard.

78
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:18,772
You will be amazed – my father burnt all
his suits.

79
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:21,903
They were stitched in England.

80
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:25,053
My mother burnt all her saris.

81
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:32,522
They used to spin their own clothes and wear
them.

82
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:40,272
My father sacrificed everything, every pie
that he had, for the freedom struggle (1 pie

83
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:41,272
= rupee 1/192).

84
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:45,123
He left nothing for us, not a single [pie].

85
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:50,502
Of course, our family being rich we had silver
and gold and all that but as far as all the

86
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:55,053
cash money was concerned – was spent.

87
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,892
And all this silver and gold also, thanks
to English, that they took away from us and

88
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,443
they returned us when they went back.

89
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:07,142
That’s how we had some silver and gold left
in the family.

90
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:10,312
Every thing, all that is material, was snatched
away.

91
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,312
And I know.

92
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:16,183
We lived in beautiful houses and then we shifted
to huts and lived there.

93
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,183
Sacrifices to the maximum.

94
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:21,552
And we were very happy about it, very proud!

95
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,993
We had only two changes (of clothes).

96
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,153
We used to wash our clothes.

97
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:33,552
We lived like very poor people; sleeping on
this kind of thing (thin, rough floor mats).

98
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:46,044
For my life, I remember that I never used
to take a pillow; I never used chappals (sandals)

99
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,044
for ages.

100
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:51,613
I had only one sweater made of this kind of
a material.

101
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:58,132
Till I passed out and went to medical college,
I had that sweater with me.

102
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:04,152
I had only one coat, throughout my education
when I was in Lahore which was terribly cold

103
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:11,382
– sometimes can be like London – which
was worn out and finished.

104
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:16,593
But we never grudged and never grumbled and
never said that our father should have looked

105
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:22,012
after us and done something, “Why did he
just sacrifice everything for the country?”

106
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:23,012
Never!

107
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:24,012
Never!

108
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:25,012
Never!

109
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:33,933
But even today, when they see us anywhere,
they know we are the children of such a great

110
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:34,933
man.

111
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,952
They have tremendous respect for us.

112
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:43,363
That quality was created, I should say by
Mahatma Gandhi.

113
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:52,483
He made everybody so transformed into a new
personality of tremendous sacrifice!

114
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,493
Tremendous!

115
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:57,572
You cannot imagine how people lived!

116
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:06,202
All the money we had, everything that we had,
all conveniences and conveyances, all housing,

117
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:12,093
everything, was given up – not only by my
father but so many of them.

118
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:19,182
Otherwise we could have not got our freedom.

119
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:25,112
To get our freedom this country has sacrificed
so much.

120
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:38,543
Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom,
to get the freedom for our Spirit.

121
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:47,942
To make our Spirit free from our greed, lust;
from your anger, from our conditionings, from

122
00:12:47,942 --> 00:13:02,413
our terrible ego, from the body being enslaved
by comforts.

123
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:06,133
I must say Gandhiji had a special charm.

124
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,252
I don’t know how he managed.

125
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:15,873
He was like Touch of Midas – he touched
anybody and he became transformed.

126
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:26,082
And he was an extremely strict man – very
kind to me, to children – but he was an

127
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:27,653
extremely strict man.

128
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,653
He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

129
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:41,372
Throughout, if you study in the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

130
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:50,062
of independence, but even before that, for
Spiritual life, anywhere, there’s one thing

131
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:54,403
very common – is sacrifice.

132
00:13:54,403 --> 00:14:01,512
And the consciousness that you are doing something
great, consciousness that you are part and

133
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:11,272
parcel of the whole, such a big thing, such
a big work, such a noble cause!!

134
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:30,122
And then there was one thing very common among
all of them: that the noble cause, the upliftment

135
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:38,613
(sic) of the noble cause, made them sacrifice
in such a sahaj manner.

136
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:42,712
Much more than the Sahaj Yogis sometimes,
who have got so much in Sahaj Yoga.

137
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,442
They have got their joy, they have got their
Spirit.

138
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:51,903
But I have seen with my own eyes, such people
in this country; whom you may call legendary

139
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,752
but I have seen it.

140
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:59,132
Thousands of people were killed and butchered,
children died.

141
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,762
Nobody shed tears.

142
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:04,553
Nobody shed tears.

143
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:22,142
But to feel that you are for such a noble
cause itself gives you that joy and that sense

144
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,903
of involvement!

145
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:33,252
And moreover, what I know about Mahatma Gandhi
and other people, what I have seen, how they

146
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:38,572
were – everybody was not allowed to come
in.

147
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:46,572
And anybody who did slightest thing less,
whether he was king’s son or he was anybody’s

148
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:55,853
daughter or anything, any little thing they
spoilt, anything – he was chucked out.

149
00:15:55,853 --> 00:16:01,932
I have stayed in Gandhi’s ashram, so I know
what it is, and that’s why you know I can

150
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,582
go through rigorous life.

151
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:05,232
It is his training.

152
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:11,892
All the children above twelve years had to
clean the whole of that ashram area – which

153
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:15,343
is in fifty acres of land – every morning.

154
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:20,922
They had to clean their latrines.

155
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:24,603
Also the latrines of the guests.

156
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:29,692
I have cleaned!

157
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:34,423
And they were allowed only two dresses.

158
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:39,233
And nothing could be kept, even you cannot
see one paper anywhere, any litter anywhere

159
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:45,022
– so clean, spick and span.

160
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:50,232
And the living places were so neat and tidy.

161
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:55,882
It was all done with cow dung, completely
with cow dung.

162
00:16:55,882 --> 00:17:03,593
Everybody had to take a bath, early in the
morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water.

163
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:12,353
Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru or Abdul Kalam
Azad, my father, of any age group, or a child.

164
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:17,853
And 5 o’clock, mahatma Gandhi was there
for his lecture.

165
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:21,423
Please don’t raise your hands or raise your
Kundalinis!

166
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:22,503
Please be seated!

167
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:23,933
That’s not the way!

168
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:28,303
Try to understand what I am talking!

169
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:40,233
And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock,
you will be surprised, getting up.

170
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:44,553
For me it was alright!

171
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:53,693
And then to walk in that fifty acres of land
to centre of that hall, which was nothing

172
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:59,323
but just an open space surrounded by some
sort of huts where Gandhiji was living.

173
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:03,473
To walk all the way after bath, after getting
ready and all that.

174
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,983
And snakes used to crawl along.

175
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,443
Nobody was bitten, of course.

176
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:17,723
I think the snakes understood that people
were busy with the great job of freeing this

177
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,953
great country!

178
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:27,503
And we would sit just like this and the snakes
would be crawling.

179
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:29,053
No lights were allowed.

180
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:32,233
No lights of any kind.

181
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:38,533
We only used sunlight.

182
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:43,493
And when Gandhiji would come – I mean sunlight
was not there in the morning, at all – some

183
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:48,163
lanterns were brought to put there.

184
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:51,463
And we would see the snakes crawling up.

185
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,263
But I never heard anybody complaining.

186
00:18:55,263 --> 00:19:06,193
But like a war, drove with such passion, everybody,
competing as to, “What I can do?

187
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:09,893
How I can be alright?”

188
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:15,513
Nobody even thought of comfort!

189
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:28,933
Of course they were all up to 50 years of
age or something like that, maybe.

190
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:35,543
In the ashram mostly people were up to fifty
years of age – at that time.

191
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:46,863
And I have seen by my own eyes the people
who had huge cars in the house and things

192
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:51,863
like that, they sold [them] off, they threw
it away.

193
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:55,093
They used to come by train to Wardha station
and walk down.

194
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,813
Gandhiji would not see anybody coming even
in tonga (horse-cart).

195
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:06,043
And they listened to him and obeyed him.

196
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:11,943
I have seen many missionaries, though they
are not up to point, nothing very noble, but

197
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:16,133
that’s how they take people to task and
people work it out for them.

198
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,133
I have seen them.

199
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:26,953
In India we had missionaries, and younger
people who came from abroad, they just absolutely

200
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:35,583
obediently listened to the missionaries and
did whatever they said.

201
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:43,513
Now today we are doing, as you know, the greatest
of greatest work!

202
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:49,573
Because freedom is of course necessary, political
freedom, to talk about the God.

203
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:53,323
We could not even make a small, little needle!

204
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,583
At that time we were not allowed by government.

205
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,583
So much oppressed.

206
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:01,543
So we had to get out of the shackles of slavery.

207
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:04,593
No doubt.

208
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:17,403
But now I find we have another kind of slavery
– a slavery of selfishness, self oriented.

209
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,673
“This is my comfort.

210
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:25,613
I must have this, it should be enjoyable,
I am enjoying, I am this, I am that."

211
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,713
You should enjoy otherwise it is not something
great.

212
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:37,283
I mean the whole thing should provide you
some sort of a feeling instead of you providing

213
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:38,673
the feeling.

214
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:47,503
Because people, I think, do not know what
they are doing, what sort of a work they are

215
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,503
doing.

216
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:53,695
They do not want to come to that level of
that height to see what are you up to.

217
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:59,803
You are trying to save the whole world!

218
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:06,003
This is one of the reasons Sahaj Yoga moves
so slowly, because I see people who are worried

219
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:11,303
about their comforts, this, that, and also
themselves are so lousy!

220
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:20,623
There’s no smartness about them, no feeling
of that greatness that they have to do.

221
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:21,623
You have to be smart.

222
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:31,063
If you know you are on war – how you behave?

223
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:36,073
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now,
better people.

224
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:40,443
I am sure we will get even better people now,
much better people!

225
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:45,773
They worry about little, little things: of
their family, this, that.

226
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:51,573
They worry about their own problems, and their
jobs, and this and that.

227
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:53,883
I mean nobody could talk like this to Gandhiji!

228
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:57,853
I tell you, he would have slapped you!

229
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:01,303
Take it from me.

230
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:07,503
It is as if to come to Sahaj Yoga means – solve
your problems – that’s all.

231
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:12,843
Though they are solved, no doubt, you are
helped, God helps you so much.

232
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:15,663
But how much are you doing about it?

233
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:27,143
Of course we have some very great Sahaj yogis,
I would not deny that fact, we have some – much

234
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:31,623
more than I had, ever – and that’s why
I am very joyous about it.

235
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:39,093
But the dedication we have: we count every
penny that we spend, how much we have got

236
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:42,423
out of that penny, what did we do about it.

237
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:48,433
This is not
the way!

238
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:50,394
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own.

239
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,323
He got money from all his disciples.

240
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,553
Built all these big things and all that.

241
00:23:54,553 --> 00:24:01,873
He never had even a public help from anybody
else.

242
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,113
So rise now!

243
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:06,713
You must rise above your petty small mind.

244
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:14,173
Rise up to the point where you should know
[that] you are going to save the whole humanity.

245
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:20,883
If you cannot feel that, it’s better to
leave Sahaj Yoga.

246
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:25,853
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for the people who
are lousy.

247
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,923
In Marathi the word is ‘gabale’.

248
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:37,933
Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama
nohe” (meaning) “It is not the work of

249
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,873
the lousy!”

250
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:50,213
Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he
caught hold of people, the sartaras and the

251
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:52,413
dukes of that time they were.

252
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:57,753
They gave up everything they had, they gave
up their lives, every thing!

253
00:24:57,753 --> 00:25:02,064
Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed
whatever they had!

254
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:07,753
Shivaji had no money to pay them.

255
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:12,923
You must have heard lots of stories about
Shivaji.

256
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:19,613
While if you see how we Sahaj yogis are in
this world: kshema (well-being) comes before

257
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:20,613
yoga.

258
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:22,483
Its like that.

259
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:25,313
Its your mother’s love.

260
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:28,093
I want my children to be comfortable.

261
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,093
They are newly born babes.

262
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:37,453
Alright, they need comfort, they are to be
looked after.

263
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:47,553
But I cannot blackmail the Divine because
the children are small can I!

264
00:25:47,553 --> 00:25:53,803
I am here to do the job of God Almighty.

265
00:25:53,803 --> 00:26:03,333
And when you are my children his grace will
work, He’ll look after you, He’ll make

266
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,543
you grow.

267
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,353
But grow now!

268
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:07,353
Grow!

269
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:08,353
You have to grow!

270
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:12,293
Get out of this small nonsense that you are!

271
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:15,473
See your personality – how do you live?

272
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,133
Where is your attention?

273
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,523
What do you think?

274
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:24,953
Are you thinking about Sahaj Yoga, that it
is the most important thing for which you

275
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:28,793
are chosen?

276
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:42,173
I feel sometimes, as I was feeling all the
time, that you might be uncomfortable in many

277
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,173
places.

278
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:48,333
But I myself have seen the way you people
have been in those places, most carelessly

279
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,873
– the Western Sahaj yogis, I was surprised.

280
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:56,123
That way Indians are better in this respect.

281
00:26:56,123 --> 00:27:00,883
And some of the Indian Sahaj yogis have been
misbehaving in a very funny manner.

282
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:01,883
It shocked me!

283
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:07,573
The way they have been behaving, shouting
at people, creating problems.

284
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:12,953
Some people come to see me, they talk to them
in such a rude manner that they run away.

285
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:15,573
You can talk to them sweetly.

286
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:18,423
You have to be nice to them; not to shout
at people.

287
00:27:18,423 --> 00:27:23,363
Alright, I cannot meet everyone at every time,
at every convenience, but that does not mean

288
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:28,423
that you have right to shout at others.

289
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:37,943
This is so petty and so low that I don’t
know how far I have to come down!

290
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:47,933
When you rise above all these petty things,
you will develop that Divine discretion.

291
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,673
That Divine discretion is the real blessing
of God.

292
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:57,523
All other blessings, that you think is a blessing,
is no blessing at all!

293
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:01,873
Unless and until you can grow, what is the
blessing?

294
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:06,353
Like a tree which says, “Oh, such a blessing
that I have got rain!”

295
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:12,733
But out of that rain if you cannot grow, what’s
the use of having that rain on you?

296
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:27,743
You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible
people, who are the highest beings on this

297
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:28,743
earth.

298
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:35,563
Take out your attention from all nonsense
that you have been busy with.

299
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:42,713
That’s how you get possessed, that’s how
you get conditioned.

300
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:46,943
Small, small things you see.

301
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:52,123
In India we have another problem: We cannot
tolerate another person.

302
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:56,373
If any person is doing good for Sahaj Yoga,
immediately a group is built up (against them)

303
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,883
– it’s very common with Indians also.

304
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:04,103
A group is built up to put him down.

305
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:09,513
This was not done when Gandhiji was there.

306
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:12,703
I do not know how it happens.

307
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,903
It only happens with poor leadership.

308
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:18,963
I think I don’t have that leadership!

309
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:23,863
At the time of Gandhiji he used to blast people
out completely!

310
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:32,053
Cutting each other’s throats and saying
things behind the back, forming groups.

311
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:37,263
Anybody who works out something nice, and
I try to help that person to express himself,

312
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:44,193
immediately a group comes up to press him.

313
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:48,343
And there are some hopelessly peripheral,
useless Sahaj Yogis in the West and in the

314
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:53,523
East, who try to make a mess of things.

315
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:57,333
They think, they are big gurus, big people!

316
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,933
Very small people.

317
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,513
Chicken hearted, I should say.

318
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:07,353
And they think they are very big, great people,
because they can take good photographs, maybe,

319
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:11,613
or that they can wear a dress in a particular
manner, or something like that – stupid

320
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:14,053
stuff as they are!

321
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:18,523
And trying to dominate others.

322
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:22,353
Such people will be thrown out, absolutely.

323
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:28,483
No use having useless people in a machine
like this.

324
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:38,163
Today is the beginning of a new era – of
a new era of people of very high qualities

325
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:43,103
whose Spirit has been enlightened.

326
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:49,033
Let us all think about it!

327
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:57,363
Now you have to rule yourself, and you have
to rule others through compassion, love and

328
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,363
discretion!!

329
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:04,923
Today that’s the big time that I have declared
that it is the Universal Religion, the Nirmala

330
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:12,383
Religion which is formed out of my teachings
of love.

331
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:16,623
But it doesn’t mean by any chance that you
remain dwarfs!

332
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:22,823
I’m not going to spoil you!

333
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:29,173
I am not going to spoil you by keeping you
dwarfy people!

334
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:34,013
So try to rise!

335
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,853
Do not dominate others.

336
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,943
Respect!

337
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:39,763
Respect each other!

338
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:46,283
You are out for a very big work of Viraat.

339
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:54,113
How much you know about the Divine nobody
has known so far!

340
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,913
But fix up yourself.

341
00:31:55,913 --> 00:32:04,633
I have known a very great saint called Gagangadh
Maharaj who has fallen down completely!

342
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:09,703
If a person like him can fall down you also
can fall down if you do not understand what

343
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:17,733
is your worth, what is your value and what
is your position you are given.

344
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:25,514
So we have to, today, with all our love for
our Mother, have to decide in our heart, that

345
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:27,673
we are going to have large heartedness, of
sacrifices!

346
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:31,203
What have we sacrificed so far?

347
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:32,683
Just think of it.

348
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:33,683
Have we?

349
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:45,133
Did we sacrifice anything?

350
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:57,373
Please try to understand that I have to use
you, the great souls, to save the humanity.

351
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,373
You must grow.

352
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,373
You must grow.

353
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,373
You have to grow.

354
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:05,403
On money points also people are wretched.

355
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:08,043
They make money.

356
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:11,143
They save money.

357
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:19,933
In America, I was surprised, the way people
cheated me of money!

358
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,173
Thousands!

359
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:28,663
In India also this is a very common practice!

360
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:38,593
Then if you have career mindedness, and you
are very ambitious, “How my job will remain?”

361
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:45,513
this, that – you better get out of Sahaj
Yoga!

362
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:52,873
It’s not going to help us at all!

363
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:59,203
Thirdly there are people who believe that,
“This is my wife, this is my beloved, this

364
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,773
is this,” and all that nonsense.

365
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,353
Why are you here?

366
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:03,843
For what?

367
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:13,493
Or “My children, my household, my mother,
my father."

368
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:17,213
all sorts of wretched people around!

369
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:24,633
If you cannot rise above that, you cannot
help me, I am sorry.

370
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:27,133
You cannot help me.

371
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:32,643
You have to be very, very strong people.

372
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:42,743
You have to be people of very great valour
and great idealism and noble ideas.

373
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:55,543
Some are like petty shopkeepers who follow
the platoons to sell some things around – in

374
00:34:55,543 --> 00:35:01,963
Marathi it is called ‘bazar bhunge’!

375
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:16,863
So now you meditate on this point that here
we are to establish the Universal Religion

376
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:17,863
of ascent.

377
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:21,103
It is a tremendous task!

378
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:31,147
If I could do it alone I would have done it
but I cannot.

379
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:34,963
It’s only through you I have to do it.

380
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:35,963
And you have a heritage.

381
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:50,893
You come from a very great birth, where you
have this heritage.

382
00:35:50,893 --> 00:36:00,383
With that heritage, if I cannot manage you,
I think I better give up your leadership.

383
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:03,643
I cannot do it!

384
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:14,043
When we were fighting for our freedom all
of us were removed from schools because we

385
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:19,963
were in the missionary school and the missionaries
believed that Christ was born in England!

386
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:21,893
So they would not allow us to study in those
schools.

387
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,733
So we were all removed from those schools.

388
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,843
We had no education for some time.

389
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:29,333
I couldn’t pass my inter-science for two
years.

390
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:35,713
I couldn’t appear because they rusticated
us from colleges and schools.

391
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:42,613
The government rusticated us.

392
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:47,073
But we were such proud children, very proud.

393
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:50,263
I was of course very much thick in it.

394
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:51,263
I was never frightened.

395
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:52,903
I was just an eighteen year old girl.

396
00:36:52,903 --> 00:37:02,123
And I remember one day some people came and
told us that your father is transferred from

397
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:04,823
this jail to another jail.

398
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,923
They had such pride for all of us, all the
people!

399
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,903
So they had brought cars to take us down.

400
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:16,052
And they were so many there.

401
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:19,723
And [my] mother naturally was worried because
I was a young girl.

402
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:25,433
The police used to torture me, used to give
me [electric] shocks, and make my life very

403
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,543
miserable, beat me, and all that.

404
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:34,313
So she was crying and she told an old gentleman
who was there that, “I am worried about

405
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,313
my daughter.

406
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:40,302
I do not want her to be tortured anymore."

407
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:46,993
So I went and smiled at him, so he said, “No,
you stop it now!

408
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:49,043
You just don’t do it.

409
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:50,753
It’s not proper."

410
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:56,563
So my father took me aside, he said, “Don’t
listen to this ‘old johnny’!

411
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:59,533
He’s now about to die.

412
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,073
Forget him.

413
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:09,813
I would like all my children to be sacrificed
on the altar of freedom.

414
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:12,773
If you are doing it I am a proud father.

415
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:16,093
And I will tell your mother to behave herself.

416
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:25,213
I am so proud of you!”

417
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:28,555
Such atmosphere I have passed through.

418
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:32,302
I had to give up my college.

419
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:34,963
I was absconding for eight months.

420
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:38,323
The police was after my life.

421
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,653
I know what we have gone through.

422
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,623
We were very young people -eighteen years.

423
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:45,063
You can imagine!

424
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:57,103
And now when you have got the freedom of your
Spirit you must seek the comfort of your Spirit.

425
00:38:57,103 --> 00:39:01,323
There are some people who are complainers,
and this and that -nonsense.

426
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,853
They should not have come!

427
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:08,883
Or those who are Indians – they should get
out of Sahaj Yoga and leave us alone.

428
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:16,773
But, those who know that they have come here,
not to enjoy themselves only, but to make

429
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:21,613
the whole world enjoy what you have got, to
give it to them.

430
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:31,183
And for that one has to sacrifice, one has
to bear the pangs!

431
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:37,173
How much I bear your pangs when you are caught
up, when you have troubles, when this and

432
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:38,173
that.

433
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,563
I have got blisters sometimes, from you, everything.

434
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:48,983
But I don’t mind because it is my life,
my mission, my existence, my everything- is

435
00:39:48,983 --> 00:39:52,903
for the purpose of emancipation of humanity.

436
00:39:52,903 --> 00:39:57,393
Even the last drop of my blood is for that.

437
00:39:57,393 --> 00:40:01,073
So my satisfactions are very different.

438
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:10,143
Please remember, you are born of a very brave
Mother.

439
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:12,463
Please, try to rise!

440
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:19,163
Be proud that you are doing such a tremendous
task.

441
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:27,493
Have that feeling of great valour.

442
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:33,423
Then only, then only, we can achieve results!

443
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:38,013
You have seen so many wars, you have seen
so many war pictures, you have seen how people

444
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:41,603
have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves.

445
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:53,233
And let us see what are we doing in this war!

446
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:56,903
Just make your body your slave.

447
00:40:56,903 --> 00:41:08,943
Get out of the slavery of your body, of your
conditionings, and your nonsensical ego.

448
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:15,013
I am sure as a Mother I am not so bad.

449
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:22,703
But as a father I think I lack some things.

450
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:35,653
Please try to come up so that I should feel
that I did not lack in my fatherly attitude

451
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:44,973
towards you – that awe, that understanding
of a father’s expectations.

452
00:41:44,973 --> 00:41:55,313
This I am not saying to you because it is
some present situation, because a few people

453
00:41:55,313 --> 00:42:02,733
particularly, or for anything which is very,
very sort of [a] present day problem.

454
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,923
None of these things.

455
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:15,633
But is my announcement of this new dimension
into which we have to rise.

456
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:21,042
And as in the war, we have to declare, “Now
forward on!”

457
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:23,613
In the same way this is a declaration.

458
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:29,763
In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult
you, or to say anything about anyone of you.

459
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:39,753
But to just infuse that inspiration which
led thousands and thousands and millions and

460
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:47,163
billions of people to sacrifice for a greater
cause!

461
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:52,873
So now have respect for yourself.

462
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:53,873
Raise your heads!

463
00:42:53,873 --> 00:42:58,383
You are the ones who are going to fight.

464
00:42:58,383 --> 00:43:02,093
You are the ones who are responsible.

465
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:03,613
Prepare yourself!

466
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,783
Prepare your body.

467
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,893
Prepare your mind!

468
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:12,643
Be discreet!

469
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:20,763
This is my, I would not say ‘request’
again.

470
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:22,903
This is my order!

471
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:28,733
May God bless you!

472
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:36,012
Let us all meditate now!

473
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:39,303
There is no need for tying up your Kundalinis.

474
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:40,943
There is no need to give yourself bandhan.

475
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:45,443
There is no need at all to do anything.

476
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:48,193
If you come up to that stage just now.

477
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:51,433
There’s no need to raise your hands and
tying up your Kundalini – not necessary.

478
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:55,583
Nothing is to be done!

479
00:43:55,583 --> 00:44:01,263
Your Kundalinis are already tied up.

480
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,323
Assume!

481
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:04,523
Assume that situation, that’s all!

482
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:26,493
That’s what you are – the veeras and not
the stupid!

483
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:27,493
Respect yourself.

484
00:44:27,493 --> 00:44:28,493
Respect!

485
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:29,743
May God bless you all.

486
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:38,943
There’s nothing, nothing more important
to me than to see you rise to that level of

487
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:42,983
understanding of your own values and worth
and discretion.

488
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:55,823
You have to become sweet, nice people but
very, very powerful!

489
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:59,433
That you can control yourself, your tongues
and your things.

490
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:06,052
The control, complete control of your self.

491
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:14,293
May God bless you again!

492
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:16,373
Please meditate.

493
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:19,493
Close your eyes!

494
00:45:19,493 --> 00:45:22,603
Close your eyes!

495
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:26,763
Just close your eyes.

496
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:34,033
Put your both the hands towards me.

497
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:38,023
Put your attention onto Sahastrara!

498
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:39,593
Just your attention onto Sahastrara.

499
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:42,713
You are in my Sahastrara all of you just now.

500
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:45,033
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

501
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,983
There’s no thought, nothing.

502
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:58,993
Just put your attention to your…and just
rise up to that point.

503
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:04,933
There’s no drama about it.

504
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:08,493
There’s nothing artificial.

505
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:10,873
It’s actualisation.

506
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:14,753
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

507
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:47,033
Let’s be strong people of strong values
with dignity and sobriety.

508
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:50,353
Silence, absolute inner silence.

509
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:53,073
And one need not talk too much.

510
00:50:53,073 --> 00:51:03,033
Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously,
is not your way.

511
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:33,763
Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your
own glory, the serenity of behaviour.

512
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:54,833
You are all saints, but saints of very high
quality, of very high quality.

513
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:55,833
Not ordinary type.

514
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:46,033
Put your attention to Sahastrara.

515
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,853
Chitta aple Sahastrara tevaitze.

516
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:56,333
Apne Sahastrar pe apna Chitta tev. (Marathi: Put your attention to your Sahastrara)

517
00:54:56,433 --> 00:55:01,513
Any thought coming say, “Not this, not this,
not this."

518
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:20,433
May God bless you.

519
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:48,913
I would like to see all the groups some time,
one by one, all the leaders and also certain

520
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:54,093
individuals who want to see me.

521
00:55:54,093 --> 00:56:11,573
We are going to have marriages, and everything,
performed here and it’s going to work out

522
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:12,433
very well.

523
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:16,293
But suddenly don’t jump onto the thing!

524
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:28,313
Do it in your sobriety, in understanding that,
this marriage is nothing but because you have

525
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:38,653
to have children of very high quality. Secondly it has to be auspicious.

526
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:45,173
Just to wash off if there was any inauspiciousness.

527
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:10,853
I hope you will enjoy your heights now, you
will enjoy you glory and you will enjoy your noble work.

528
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,733
May God bless you.
