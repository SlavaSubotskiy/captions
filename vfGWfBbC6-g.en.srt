00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:07,336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

2
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:30,559
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

3
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,578
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

4
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,804
I don’t know what to say.

5
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,027
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

6
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:48,965
because most of you come from a culture

7
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,895
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

8
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,993
They never realised how important it was that,

9
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:01,342
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

10
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:08,086
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

11
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:18,297
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

12
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:23,961
And also the desire to know the Divine

13
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,875
vanishes also in the thin air

14
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:42,430
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

15
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:47,898
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

16
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:57,226
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

17
00:08:57,531 --> 00:09:02,297
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

18
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:11,257
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

19
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:17,528
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

20
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:31,875
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

21
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:37,820
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

22
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:46,339
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

23
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:50,426
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

24
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:53,098
and entertained us the most.

25
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:56,535
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

26
00:09:56,695 --> 00:10:01,521
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

27
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:05,422
and they think that you are laughing at them.

28
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:16,594
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

29
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:23,144
was more than what one would expect

30
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:28,414
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

31
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:34,438
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

32
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:36,895
that made us so happy.

33
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:43,532
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

34
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:50,497
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

35
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:56,360
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

36
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,442
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

37
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:06,938
His manifestation within you is so evident.

38
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:12,278
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

39
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:15,270
so very different from other people.

40
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:19,731
One day I was travelling from London

41
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:26,117
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

42
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:31,500
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

43
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:39,402
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

44
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,953
I asked her, “Who are you?”

45
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:48,984
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

46
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:54,766
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

47
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,801
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

48
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:04,301
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

49
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:10,719
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

50
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,074
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

51
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:22,723
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

52
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:27,746
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

53
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,899
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

54
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,992
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

55
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:38,918
He’s not talked about the source.

56
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:45,442
I said, “Better find out,

57
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:50,367
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

58
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:56,227
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

59
00:12:56,387 --> 00:13:00,348
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

60
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,129
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

61
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:10,102
and not by the Father.

62
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:13,196
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

63
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:18,617
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

64
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:22,063
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

65
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:33,832
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

66
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,910
also about the Jews.

67
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:45,344
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

68
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,902
nor about Shri Ganesh.

69
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:57,071
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

70
00:13:57,231 --> 00:14:04,891
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

71
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:10,692
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

72
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:18,328
So now, when we deal with our children,

73
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:24,375
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

74
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:28,816
they are very innocent, very simple;

75
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:34,836
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

76
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,691
and they lose their moorings.

77
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:48,563
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

78
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:53,629
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

79
00:14:54,067 --> 00:15:01,364
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

80
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,504
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

81
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:13,758
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

82
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,215
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

83
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:21,644
But you should know He is on every chakra.

84
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:32,211
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

85
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,644
specially the spiritual one.

86
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:40,168
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

87
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,223
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

88
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:53,754
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

89
00:15:54,629 --> 00:16:03,512
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

90
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:12,220
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

91
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,074
It was Sahaj.

92
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:21,203
The life before Self-realisation was different.

93
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,718
You got your transformation

94
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:33,769
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

95
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:37,305
But here now we have to see

96
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:42,555
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

97
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:47,494
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

98
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:55,875
you have to cure people, you have to love them

99
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:58,641
and you have to be compassionate

100
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:06,602
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

101
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:11,407
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

102
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:21,014
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

103
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,904
You can project it to others.

104
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:32,216
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

105
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:39,240
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

106
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:44,398
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

107
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,218
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

108
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:52,749
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

109
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:57,406
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

110
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,507
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

111
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,851
This is what you have to practise,

112
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:09,425
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

113
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:15,178
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

114
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:18,734
Now, for example, say

115
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:28,778
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

116
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,695
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

117
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:38,398
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

118
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,792
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

119
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:52,011
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

120
00:18:52,902 --> 00:19:00,132
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

121
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:06,862
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

122
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,863
Not very difficult.

123
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:14,992
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

124
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:20,957
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

125
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,281
The energy will diminish.

126
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:33,394
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

127
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:40,342
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

128
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:42,826
you are not ordinary people

129
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:48,299
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

130
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:58,045
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

131
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:01,697
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

132
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:06,818
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

133
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:12,874
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

134
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:16,310
or how to deliberately do this.

135
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,545
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

136
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:23,162
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

137
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:35,498
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

138
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:39,705
but just your majestic personality.

139
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,564
This personality is here now, you see,

140
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:49,204
is sitting in such a majestic manner

141
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:56,490
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

142
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:05,955
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

143
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:13,084
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

144
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:16,447
I don’t think is alright.

145
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:22,021
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

146
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,548
so much ego, so much conditioning.

147
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:33,365
But something within you can rise above others

148
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:43,947
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

149
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,615
where you stand with yourself.

150
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:50,552
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

151
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:55,357
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

152
00:21:55,517 --> 00:22:03,564
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

153
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:08,831
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

154
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:15,600
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

155
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:19,211
But the innocence that you have,

156
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:25,238
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

157
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:32,460
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

158
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,428
you are not properly dressed up

159
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,964
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

160
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,230
that they expect every other person to be.

161
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,424
It’s a funny thing that in this world

162
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:49,933
all human beings expect others to be very good.

163
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:52,410
Everybody should be a hero or something

164
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,261
– what about themselves they never think!

165
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,613
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

166
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:02,676
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

167
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:08,293
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

168
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:13,144
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

169
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,347
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

170
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:21,965
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

171
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:28,230
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

172
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,359
as a child does.

173
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:36,488
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

174
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,840
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

175
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,769
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

176
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:51,316
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

177
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:59,921
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

178
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,832
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

179
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:09,976
the whole world get worried about it,

180
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:14,074
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

181
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:20,410
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

182
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,558
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

183
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:28,801
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

184
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:34,707
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

185
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:39,301
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

186
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:43,828
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

187
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:52,605
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

188
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:55,124
but just spontaneously.

189
00:24:55,992 --> 00:25:03,207
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

190
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,105
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

191
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:10,105
You can’t run away from the society.

192
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:18,156
You start getting all the rapport with such people

193
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:22,903
who are talking about things

194
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:27,058
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

195
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:31,226
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

196
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,465
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

197
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:42,469
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

198
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:51,238
In the sense that – when I was in London

199
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,832
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

200
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:59,832
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

201
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,960
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

202
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:05,715
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

203
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,840
all the married women have to wear this.

204
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,324
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

205
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,066
So I said that,

206
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:20,582
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

207
00:26:20,742 --> 00:26:24,035
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

208
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:30,445
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

209
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:36,379
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

210
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,644
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

211
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:46,343
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

212
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,152
For the innocence, I think

213
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:55,382
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

214
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:01,668
And that’s how it is a society, today,

215
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:08,113
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

216
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,129
Every individual is separate,

217
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:14,543
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

218
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:20,910
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

219
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,324
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

220
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:28,769
or greed behind the whole thing.

221
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:34,426
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

222
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:39,965
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

223
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,480
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

224
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,484
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

225
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:54,472
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

226
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,957
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

227
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:00,847
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

228
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:02,691
“What will they misunderstand?”

229
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:06,918
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

230
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:09,754
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

231
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:13,480
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

232
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,019
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

233
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,918
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

234
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,480
But then I noticed it’s too much

235
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,543
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

236
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:32,691
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

237
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:36,511
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

238
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,980
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

239
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:49,652
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

240
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:57,195
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

241
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:02,347
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

242
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,574
I just can’t understand how they accept.

243
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:10,304
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

244
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:15,324
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

245
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:18,980
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

246
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,738
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

247
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:29,566
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

248
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:34,996
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

249
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:40,226
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

250
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:45,150
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

251
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,479
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

252
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,933
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

253
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:55,379
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

254
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:58,569
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

255
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:03,444
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

256
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:09,070
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

257
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,238
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

258
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:21,491
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

259
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:25,558
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

260
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:31,571
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

261
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:35,535
but every time you see something you find

262
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:40,199
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

263
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,926
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

264
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:51,234
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

265
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:57,512
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

266
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,676
I don’t understand.

267
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:03,918
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

268
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,363
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

269
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:09,543
“So what? What’s wrong?”

270
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:13,488
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

271
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:17,293
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

272
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:22,722
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

273
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:27,808
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

274
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:34,113
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

275
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:39,074
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

276
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:44,672
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

277
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:47,332
you should be very careful,

278
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:50,268
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

279
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:54,578
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

280
00:31:56,054 --> 00:32:04,621
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

281
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:11,008
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

282
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:17,801
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

283
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:25,195
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

284
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:31,347
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

285
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:35,433
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

286
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:39,957
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

287
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:44,855
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

288
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:50,011
how He has made their attention so beautiful

289
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:54,347
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

290
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,843
all the innocent things of the world.”

291
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,902
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

292
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:06,262
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

293
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:07,988
There are many who are struggling

294
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:13,465
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

295
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,514
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

296
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:21,221
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

297
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:24,668
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

298
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:29,406
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

299
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,301
That shows that there are so many people still

300
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:40,996
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

301
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:42,755
and they want to enjoy it.

302
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:46,254
But a society has to be created of that kind.

303
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:51,644
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

304
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:59,015
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

305
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,232
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

306
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:05,299
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

307
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:10,387
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

308
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:14,328
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

309
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:19,113
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

310
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:23,832
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

311
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:27,707
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

312
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:34,426
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

313
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:38,246
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

314
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:40,618
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

315
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,863
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

316
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:46,379
And one of them then turned around and said,

317
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:49,980
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

318
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,222
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

319
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,051
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

320
00:34:55,211 --> 00:35:00,340
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

321
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,176
you have to project now, to project towards others.

322
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:08,074
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

323
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:11,066
just with one glance you can put that person right,

324
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:16,566
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

325
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:19,867
In a way that’s a projection.

326
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:24,754
Around your society, around where you are working,

327
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:30,058
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

328
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:33,387
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

329
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:39,222
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

330
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:43,066
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

331
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:47,222
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

332
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:50,488
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

333
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,433
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

334
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:58,949
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

335
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,715
You have those qualities within you

336
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,191
because potentially you had them before

337
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:10,590
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

338
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,719
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

339
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:22,113
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

340
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:26,363
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

341
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:31,183
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

342
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:34,918
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

343
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:38,754
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

344
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:44,738
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

345
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:48,519
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

346
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,715
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

347
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:57,344
It is not a coincidence we should say.

348
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:03,269
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

349
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,855
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

350
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:10,558
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

351
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:13,822
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

352
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,562
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

353
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:21,714
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

354
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,176
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

355
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:27,477
He put them under the seat and did all that.

356
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:34,472
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

357
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:38,405
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

358
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,863
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

359
00:37:44,023 --> 00:37:46,587
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

360
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:51,457
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

361
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:54,472
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

362
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:56,918
You see, it is the power that you have.

363
00:37:57,078 --> 00:38:01,898
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

364
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:09,468
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

365
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:13,406
You see, how children understand love.

366
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:19,319
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

367
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:25,257
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

368
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:30,496
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

369
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,207
and they were very troublesome to begin with

370
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,154
and the parents were worried about them.

371
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:40,656
They sent them to Dharamsala

372
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:45,691
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

373
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:49,363
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

374
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:54,074
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

375
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:57,051
they came back and the parents asked them,

376
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,989
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

377
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,139
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

378
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,160
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

379
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,203
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

380
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,201
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

381
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:21,066
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

382
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,597
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

383
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:25,965
We are not bothered.”

384
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,004
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

385
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,426
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

386
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:34,137
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

387
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:38,176
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

388
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:42,301
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

389
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:46,294
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

390
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:51,602
Very much satisfied, dignified.

391
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,989
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

392
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:59,910
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

393
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,812
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

394
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,595
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

395
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:10,324
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

396
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:13,961
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

397
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,871
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

398
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:20,653
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

399
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:28,623
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

400
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:32,332
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

401
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:34,692
but I have not been with them for a long time,

402
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:37,202
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

403
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:41,680
but look at the love that they have.

404
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,192
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

405
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:48,270
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

406
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,481
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

407
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,723
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

408
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:58,293
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

409
00:40:58,453 --> 00:41:05,067
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

410
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:11,364
and so much they admire, they want it.

411
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:17,449
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

412
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:22,427
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

413
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:26,554
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

414
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:30,043
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

415
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:34,207
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

416
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,056
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

417
00:41:36,216 --> 00:41:39,028
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

418
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:44,899
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

419
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:49,285
and we enjoyed all that very much.

420
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:55,961
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

421
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,926
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

422
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:07,938
creating something sweet of this kind.

423
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:13,043
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

424
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:20,215
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

425
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:25,153
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

426
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:28,738
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

427
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:31,942
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

428
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:34,660
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

429
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,949
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

430
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:43,973
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

431
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:48,528
so they got equipped from within.

432
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:53,254
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

433
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:57,137
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

434
00:42:57,297 --> 00:43:04,621
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

435
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:07,551
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

436
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,801
also know that we have to give it to others.

437
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:15,324
We have to pour this into others.

438
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:18,809
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

439
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:22,762
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

440
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:28,090
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

441
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:33,035
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

442
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:37,301
And Shiva had to cut His head

443
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:41,949
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

444
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:47,971
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

445
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:52,153
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

446
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:56,762
because in innocence you become a person

447
00:43:56,922 --> 00:44:00,332
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

448
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:04,630
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

449
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:10,399
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

450
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:17,012
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

451
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:18,582
There was a king in China.

452
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,403
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

453
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:32,903
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

454
00:44:33,063 --> 00:44:37,336
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

455
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:41,293
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

456
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:46,426
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

457
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:48,528
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

458
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:54,567
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

459
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:59,319
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

460
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,155
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

461
00:45:02,315 --> 00:45:06,155
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

462
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:09,889
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

463
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:17,994
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

464
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,432
So all the cocks were together.

465
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:26,178
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

466
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:29,561
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

467
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:32,791
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

468
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:35,053
he was just standing straight.

469
00:45:35,213 --> 00:45:39,717
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

470
00:45:39,877 --> 00:45:45,038
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

471
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:49,366
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

472
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:53,045
where they were having these fights.

473
00:45:53,205 --> 00:45:57,518
And this was the only cock which stood up.

474
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,381
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

475
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:08,053
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

476
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:12,419
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

477
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,804
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

478
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:20,264
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

479
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:25,006
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

480
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:30,768
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

481
00:46:30,928 --> 00:46:40,362
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

482
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:43,585
if you take to your innocence.

483
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:48,909
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

484
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:54,452
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

485
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:58,416
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

486
00:46:58,576 --> 00:47:00,815
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

487
00:47:00,975 --> 00:47:03,674
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

488
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,948
It rained so much so that they said,

489
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:11,002
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

490
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,399
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

491
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:19,033
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

492
00:47:19,193 --> 00:47:25,233
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

493
00:47:25,764 --> 00:47:32,760
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

494
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,053
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

495
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:42,065
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

496
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:47,588
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

497
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:53,671
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

498
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:58,915
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

499
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:03,963
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

500
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:17,718
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

501
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:20,212
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

502
00:48:20,372 --> 00:48:25,369
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

503
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:32,112
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

504
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:38,383
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

505
00:48:38,543 --> 00:48:42,125
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

506
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:45,922
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

507
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:50,914
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

508
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:55,398
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

509
00:48:55,558 --> 00:49:00,672
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

510
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:03,961
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

511
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:08,570
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

512
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:16,277
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

513
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:20,029
How He guides you and how He helps you.

514
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,434
How He takes you to [the] right path.

515
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:25,043
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

516
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:30,418
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

517
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:35,012
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

518
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:40,137
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

519
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:44,504
He takes you to the righteous road.

520
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:48,699
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

521
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:51,410
You always meet friends here and there.

522
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,824
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

523
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:56,426
And that is how He works.

524
00:49:56,586 --> 00:50:06,160
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

525
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,801
because you are His ganas.

526
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:11,844
But the ganas have to work!

527
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:18,585
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

528
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:27,230
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

529
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:33,340
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

530
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,410
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

531
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,871
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

532
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:42,945
He gives you all the good time.

533
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,309
Then what are we doing about it?

534
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:51,637
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

535
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:55,399
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

536
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:59,824
What can we do as antibodies?

537
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:11,736
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

538
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:18,759
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

539
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:25,381
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

540
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,967
You may melt away many people.

541
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:35,139
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

542
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:39,951
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

543
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:43,707
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

544
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:48,566
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

545
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:51,425
Because you are so powerful.

546
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:54,677
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

547
00:51:54,838 --> 00:52:00,115
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

548
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:03,545
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

549
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:07,709
And all that works out so well.

550
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:11,389
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

551
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:17,405
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

552
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:20,588
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:25,733
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

554
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,893
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

555
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:33,694
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

556
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:37,518
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

557
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,147
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

558
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:45,686
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

559
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,483
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

560
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:53,358
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

561
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:58,722
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

562
00:53:00,026 --> 00:53:03,030
But you are not to feel any strain.

563
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,436
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

564
00:53:07,596 --> 00:53:10,366
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

565
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:12,811
– confidence and faith in yourself.

566
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:17,928
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

567
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:21,822
which is nothing but compassion and love.

568
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:24,905
If you have that faith

569
00:53:25,065 --> 00:53:30,401
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

570
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:39,979
of having [a] relationship with others.

571
00:53:41,643 --> 00:53:49,127
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

572
00:53:50,197 --> 00:53:53,658
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

573
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,522
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

574
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:01,905
I have never got into a fury or a temper

575
00:54:02,065 --> 00:54:04,248
because I think I can manage without it.

576
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:08,272
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

577
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:13,350
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

578
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,936
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

579
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:20,858
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

580
00:54:21,018 --> 00:54:24,201
it is such an energy-giving thing,

581
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:33,861
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

582
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,889
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

583
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:44,139
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

584
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:48,920
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

585
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,006
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

586
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:55,033
that you can’t leave.

587
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:01,280
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

588
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,463
they don’t know how the child is lost.

589
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:09,898
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

590
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:15,334
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

591
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:18,186
But when they are young, they are innocent

592
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:22,834
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

593
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:28,373
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

594
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:32,553
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

595
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:39,193
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

596
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:43,771
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

597
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:47,600
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

598
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,725
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

599
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:56,920
that your children are looked after.

600
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,295
But you are also a child of your Mother.

601
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:04,811
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

602
00:56:04,971 --> 00:56:11,201
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

603
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:14,803
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

604
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:19,764
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

605
00:56:19,924 --> 00:56:21,787
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

606
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:25,303
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

607
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:27,318
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

608
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:30,962
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

609
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:39,525
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

610
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,436
Today is to celebrate His birth

611
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:50,022
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

612
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:56,049
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

613
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:01,483
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

614
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:08,112
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

615
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,026
And that’s why He was first created.

616
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:17,889
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

617
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:21,440
so that He can look after all the people

618
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:29,479
who are going to come from ages to ages,

619
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:34,464
to guide them always on the right path.

620
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,405
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

621
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:43,733
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

622
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,444
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

623
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:48,553
That I should have not done.”

624
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:54,045
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

625
00:57:54,205 --> 00:57:57,389
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

626
00:57:57,549 --> 00:58:00,881
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

627
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:04,811
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

628
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:08,670
“Why did you give up your land?”

629
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:12,881
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

630
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:17,363
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

631
00:58:17,523 --> 00:58:21,546
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

632
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,623
So I thought it’s better to give up.

633
00:58:23,783 --> 00:58:26,194
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

634
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:30,549
And he so innocently was telling me that,

635
00:58:30,986 --> 00:58:36,756
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

636
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,858
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

637
00:58:40,018 --> 00:58:44,256
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

638
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,262
But I said, “What about your brother?”

639
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,908
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

640
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,998
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

641
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:57,381
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

642
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:00,537
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

643
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:03,366
Later on I might become a bad man.”

644
00:59:03,526 --> 00:59:07,177
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

645
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:09,889
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

646
00:59:10,049 --> 00:59:14,607
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

647
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:19,116
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

648
00:59:19,276 --> 00:59:20,694
I don’t know what to do.

649
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:24,030
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

650
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:30,003
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

651
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:33,467
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

652
00:59:33,627 --> 00:59:37,631
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

653
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:41,936
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

654
00:59:42,096 --> 00:59:47,951
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

655
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,647
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

656
00:59:51,807 --> 00:59:56,014
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

657
00:59:56,174 --> 00:59:58,858
So he can save me from the smoking.”

658
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:03,381
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

659
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:06,256
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

660
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:09,811
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

661
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:14,467
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

662
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:19,092
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

663
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:23,709
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

664
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:27,966
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

665
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:33,354
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

666
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:38,897
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

667
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:43,686
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

668
01:00:43,846 --> 01:00:49,319
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

669
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:55,037
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

670
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:58,858
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

671
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:02,006
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

672
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:06,522
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

673
01:01:06,682 --> 01:01:10,983
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

674
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:14,908
For example, I have never seen such honest people

675
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:18,728
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

676
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:22,510
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

677
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,541
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

678
01:01:25,701 --> 01:01:28,463
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

679
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:32,213
but most of you have become so honest.

680
01:01:32,373 --> 01:01:35,072
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

681
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:39,084
and to see people who are so honest.

682
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:43,030
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

683
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,908
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

684
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:53,865
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

685
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:59,689
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

686
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:04,255
how you people are so much fond of me.

687
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:15,828
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

688
01:02:15,918 --> 01:02:19,172
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

689
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,948
But the another quality, as I said, is that

690
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:29,870
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

691
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:35,597
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

692
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:42,394
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

693
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:49,948
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

694
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:53,423
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

695
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:57,113
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

696
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:02,527
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

697
01:03:02,687 --> 01:03:07,722
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

698
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:10,128
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

699
01:03:10,288 --> 01:03:14,019
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

700
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:19,917
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

701
01:03:20,077 --> 01:03:23,964
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

702
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:26,245
Nobody makes a mistake.”

703
01:03:26,405 --> 01:03:29,808
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

704
01:03:29,968 --> 01:03:34,300
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

705
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:38,460
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

706
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:42,738
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

707
01:03:42,898 --> 01:03:47,894
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

708
01:03:48,054 --> 01:03:51,933
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

709
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:56,519
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

710
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:04,222
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

711
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:15,710
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

712
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:20,948
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

713
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:25,808
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

714
01:04:25,968 --> 01:04:29,519
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

715
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,104
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

716
01:04:32,264 --> 01:04:35,573
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

717
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:42,480
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

718
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,386
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

719
01:04:48,546 --> 01:04:56,027
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

720
01:04:56,187 --> 01:05:00,933
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

721
01:05:01,093 --> 01:05:08,667
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

722
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:15,378
with such speed and with such lightness:

723
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:17,964
they were lifting their legs and hand.

724
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:23,499
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

725
01:05:24,608 --> 01:05:29,706
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

726
01:05:29,866 --> 01:05:33,784
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

727
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:37,698
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

728
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,573
They earn their living, they are farmers,

729
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:45,683
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

730
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:49,636
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

731
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:57,995
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

732
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:01,277
or another bad things that people think

733
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:04,881
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

734
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:08,127
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

735
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:13,870
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

736
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:16,011
in a very beautiful manner.

737
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:22,058
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

738
01:06:22,218 --> 01:06:25,402
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

739
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:31,402
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

740
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:37,706
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

741
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:43,058
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

742
01:06:43,218 --> 01:06:45,792
and think of violence and killing people?

743
01:06:45,952 --> 01:06:48,589
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

744
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:52,597
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

745
01:06:52,757 --> 01:06:57,613
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

746
01:06:57,773 --> 01:07:04,105
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

747
01:07:04,265 --> 01:07:08,339
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

748
01:07:08,499 --> 01:07:14,253
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

749
01:07:14,413 --> 01:07:16,534
There is no need for us to fight.

750
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:21,089
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

751
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:24,870
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

752
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,050
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

753
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,761
He’ll either become a transformed person

754
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:34,937
or he will not be there to trouble you.

755
01:07:35,772 --> 01:07:40,894
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

756
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:43,296
and our powers.

757
01:07:44,765 --> 01:07:49,097
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

758
01:07:49,257 --> 01:07:54,280
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

759
01:07:54,921 --> 01:07:59,175
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

760
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,835
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

761
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:04,623
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

762
01:08:04,784 --> 01:08:07,986
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

763
01:08:08,147 --> 01:08:10,206
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

764
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:13,214
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

765
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:18,605
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

766
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:24,534
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

767
01:08:24,694 --> 01:08:27,042
You can do it, everything. You can.

768
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:31,433
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

769
01:08:31,593 --> 01:08:36,277
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

770
01:08:36,437 --> 01:08:38,628
you are not going to spoil anybody,

771
01:08:38,788 --> 01:08:43,659
but your power itself will show that this power

772
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:52,214
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

773
01:08:52,374 --> 01:08:55,409
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

774
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:01,335
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

775
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:06,925
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

776
01:09:07,085 --> 01:09:14,585
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

777
01:09:15,366 --> 01:09:21,042
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

778
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:25,073
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

779
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:28,308
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

780
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:32,363
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

781
01:09:32,523 --> 01:09:36,136
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

782
01:09:36,296 --> 01:09:39,198
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

783
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:41,904
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

784
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:45,237
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

785
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:48,488
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

786
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:52,214
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

787
01:09:52,374 --> 01:09:54,417
and they are sitting there and fighting,

788
01:09:54,577 --> 01:09:58,253
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

789
01:09:58,413 --> 01:10:02,557
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

790
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:05,730
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

791
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,464
So there were four tiers.

792
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:11,464
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

793
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,823
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

794
01:10:13,983 --> 01:10:18,928
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

795
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:23,433
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

796
01:10:23,593 --> 01:10:31,421
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

797
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:38,191
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

798
01:10:38,351 --> 01:10:43,624
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

799
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:46,902
He’s the one who worked it out.

800
01:10:47,062 --> 01:10:48,464
That’s why they say always,

801
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:52,378
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

802
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:55,339
because then it gives you that peace,

803
01:10:55,499 --> 01:11:01,050
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

804
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,343
that you never thought it would.

805
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:11,956
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

806
01:11:12,116 --> 01:11:16,878
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

807
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:20,042
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

808
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:22,417
We are still hoping to get the land

809
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:25,824
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

810
01:11:25,984 --> 01:11:28,558
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

811
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:32,839
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

812
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:36,940
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

813
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:43,085
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

814
01:11:43,952 --> 01:11:47,659
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

815
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,019
But all that has worked out so well and now

816
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:54,894
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

817
01:11:55,054 --> 01:11:57,133
May God Bless you.
