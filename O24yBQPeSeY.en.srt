1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,530
You all have come now to Bangalore,

2
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,520
and yesterday you had gone to Mysore, which was

3
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,630
ruled by mahishasura.

4
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,600
That's the reason you didn't get your food - it crossed you.

5
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,620
It's better not to eat food in such places isn't it, all right.

6
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,520
So it's a very beautiful place, Bangalore is.

7
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,580
Climate is beautiful and you'll find always these rakshasas

8
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,590
lived in places like this. Like in Pune, you have,

9
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,590
you know this Rajneesh was there â€“

10
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,550
here is this mahishasura.

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,560
They always try to find places which are cold

12
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,490
because they have so much heat in their body.

13
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,520
Now as you know, there's one more rakshasa here

14
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,530
who has to be exposed.

15
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:08,550
And this, today through our puja, we should achieve it.

16
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,700
In the olden days when the Goddess had to fight

17
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,720
the rakshasas, the rakshasas were not involved in human

18
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,710
beings as such.

19
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,680
They didn't become gurus or anything.

20
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,670
And so, now we find in Kali yuga they have gone into

21
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,500
the brains of sadhakas, of their devotees.

22
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,680
It's very difficult to remove them.

23
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,570
And once they go into the brain of the sadhakas,

24
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,610
then sadhakas become of course possessed, they suffer,

25
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,580
they have all kinds of problems.

26
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,710
Despite that, they stick onto that person because

27
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,590
they are mesmerized, very much mesmerized.

28
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,650
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely so strong

29
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,600
headed that even if they have to die,

30
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,580
they wouldn't give up their gurus.

31
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,670
The main thing is that in this Kali yuga there are so many

32
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,590
sadhakas, they are running helter and skelter.

33
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,700
They are running all over trying to find out some way

34
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,650
of finding the Truth.

35
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,490
Why when the market is on, you know you get people

36
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,680
to sell it also.

37
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,610
So that's how so many have come up and are trying

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,620
these things, tricks, on people all over.

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,620
Most of them have gone to the Western countries

40
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,690
because people have money.

41
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,570
Thank God we are not so rich in India that they could not

42
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,630
befool us - especially in America.

43
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,540
And Americans took to these people as a fish takes to

44
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,480
water, very simple.

45
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,610
I went there and told them and warned them - they wouldn't

46
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,650
listen to Me. They can't understand anything that

47
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,520
you can get without money.

48
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,480
But despite all that, so many of you have been able to

49
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,680
come to Sahaja Yoga and get to the Reality.

50
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,710
It's your destiny. It's blessings to you of your previous lives

51
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,640
that you could see it so clearly and come to Sahaja Yoga

52
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,520
and now you have grown so much, you have become

53
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,550
so matured and you understand what others are doing

54
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,550
is absolutely wrong.

55
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,490
Also somebody told me about this fellow Boy John (George)

56
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,610
misbehaving with these homosexuals and all that,

57
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,610
and calling them "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna"

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,710
and all nonsense.

59
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,510
Then I discovered that this story is very prevalent in Kerala,

60
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,650
where they say that Krishna when he became, I mean

61
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,600
Vishnu, when he became Mohini, he had a child from Shiva.

62
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,720
Absurd. And now, Murti was telling Me when I told you this

63
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,500
story, you said "this is blasphemy, this is sin".

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Same way I feel.

65
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,490
It is very dangerous also to play about with

66
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,720
a person like Vishnu. He is a very dangerous deity.

67
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,540
Shiva ultimately is very dangerous but it takes time with Him.

68
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,590
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has to be very

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,500
careful, misbehaving like this.

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,640
I don't know what is going to happen to them.

71
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,520
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

72
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,550
One thing they should judge that if this thing you are doing

73
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,720
is good for them, is by God's blessings,

74
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,570
then why should you get diseases.

75
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,670
There is a regular one crore of people going to a nonsensical

76
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,560
place where they have this Ayappa business,

77
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,670
and they wear black dresses for one month,

78
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,650
and they have their beard and everything.

79
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,600
They starve themselves, they go up miles together,

80
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,630
they climb do all kinds of things that is a sort of

81
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,530
a suffering for one month.

82
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,520
And eleven months they do everything.

83
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,500
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

84
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,610
So now it has become like a craze like jogging or something

85
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,560
like that in Kerala.

86
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,680
And this year there were one crore of people doing this

87
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,540
stupid nonsense.

88
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,520
I mean even in India we have such stupid people,

89
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,680
you can see that.

90
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,610
But the number is not so much, I must say,

91
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,500
as it is in America, percentage.

92
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,520
In India, we are very conditioned by these ritualisms,

93
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,610
especially in the South we have lots of ritualistic things.

94
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,540
And we are impressed by people if you take out some watches,

95
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,710
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

96
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,490
To them, it is something really remarkable that how can you

97
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,650
have Swiss made watches here.

98
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,660
Very simple people.

99
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,690
They do not understand that none of the Incarnations did these

100
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:03,660
tricks and that truth should be based on the tradition,

101
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,630
on the shastras.

102
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:16,710
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates is actually heretic

103
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,510
and also is blasphemy.

104
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,530
But as I told you the other day that those people

105
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,550
who talk of Knowledge, like Sufis, who got their Realization,

106
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,530
real Sufis, they were called as heretics -

107
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,620
they were thrown out of the religion.

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,520
Also, the Christians, the early Christians,

109
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,550
who were Gnostics were called as mad people, heretics.

110
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,540
In the same way, those who are following stupid things,

111
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,530
and are following something that is very black and dark

112
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,610
negative, will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

113
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,710
and will say that this is something heretic or it is something

114
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,580
that is blasphemy.

115
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,650
But, as you understand now what it is, we have to bring forth

116
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,490
new laws that those who are not Sahaja Yogis are actually,

117
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,640
if they are practicing any religion, they are not doing

118
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,590
the right thing.

119
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,620
Slowly, slowly as Vatican is getting exposed and

120
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,650
the Christian churches are getting exposed,

121
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,700
even in India so many such organizations are getting exposed,

122
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,670
and people are understanding that this is very wrong.

123
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,560
These ideas actually have come from incarnations,

124
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,620
like Adi Shankaracharya said "Tatatkim, Tatakim, Tatatkim" -

125
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,480
if you have not followed your guru then "Tatatkim".

126
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,660
So they said now any guru can come from the jail,

127
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:15,630
can be a smuggler, can be anything, characterless person -

128
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,690
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

129
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,640
Whatever we call somebody, say we call somebody as a guru

130
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,680
and we stick on, "this is my guru".

131
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,630
But what did the guru give to you, that nobody asks.

132
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,550
You just feel happy, oh very nice. It's like the worms

133
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,620
clinging onto the lotus and saying, "oh, we have lotus".

134
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,560
What about you, you are a worm still, what is the use of these

135
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,610
lotuses or whether that is lotus or a snake, God only knows.

136
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,560
So a guru who doesn't talk of Realization,

137
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,570
who doesn't talk of Kundalini, who doesn't talk of ascent,

138
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,700
who doesn't talk of second birth - cannot be a guru -

139
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,720
minimum of minimum.

140
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,700
So like we also believe in say Rama - "I believe in Rama" -

141
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,710
so what? Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging you.

142
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,710
"I believe in Christ" - so what?

143
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,500
You believe in this, you believe in that -

144
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,550
it is such an absurd idea still I never understand when people

145
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,710
say, "I believe in this".

146
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,550
What does that make, what does that mean.

147
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,720
You believe in Christ.

148
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,500
You are leading a licentious life, you are doing all kinds -

149
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,500
but "I believe in Christ, I believe in God".

150
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,690
Doing everything against divinity and I believe.

151
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,560
So the question comes, what do you mean by believing?

152
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,660
It's like, "I believe it is silver" - so what, it is silver.

153
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,480
What does it make to you to believe by that,

154
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,680
saying something you have done great.

155
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,630
What is great in that?

156
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,670
Now if you say I believe in Shri Mataji, so what.

157
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,680
All right you believe in Me because of certain experiences -

158
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,650
still what?

159
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,650
Mataji should be in your life -

160
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,580
should be in your expression, in your behaviour,

161
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,560
in your treatment to others,

162
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,550
in understanding each other, and loving each other.

163
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,570
That is what impresses people.

164
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,640
People say, "All right, we'll come to Mataji,

165
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,540
e'll just pray to Her and go away - we'll not talk to Her.

166
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,530
Why? Because we believe in Mataji. Finished.

167
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,480
So now we have to understand that you believe in Sahaja Yoga,

168
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,690
of course it is shraddha (faith), it is not a blind faith I agree,

169
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,590
but still belief has to penetrate into your being.

170
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,690
This belief has to act, has to show results,

171
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,650
it has to work out in every way.

172
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,490
Somebody might say that we believe in Mataji and

173
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,720
She does everything - She'll do bhakti for us?

174
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,610
Should sit down and sing the song of Mataji or what?

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,710
So what is going to come from your side, that is what we have

176
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,720
to understand and once that starts working then these demons

177
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,620
and these rakshasas will all vanish, no problem.

178
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,510
So what am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?

179
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,500
You should ask the question, "what am I doing?".

180
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,630
Now if you make this instrument, and then if it is not doing

181
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,550
anything, what is the use of making the instrument.

182
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,690
Now you are the light, you have got enlightenment

183
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,650
but what is the use of a light which is hanging somewhere,

184
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,590
which is not giving light to anyone.

185
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,490
So when you are giving light to others, in a very innocent

186
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,600
manner, in a very reciprocal manner -

187
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,590
not this way that we are giving light because we want to have

188
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,700
an advantage over it, or we want to show off or

189
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,510
any all nonsensical things that are there.

190
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,610
Then the derailment starts. People start saying,

191
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,670
"Oh, I am this, I am that."

192
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,650
But with full understanding, that we are instruments

193
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,480
in the hands of the divinity and we are just enjoying

194
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,590
that divinity flowing through us and working out,

195
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,550
you won't feel tired, you won't feel upset,

196
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,540
you'll not be in any way in trouble.

197
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,490
But this has happened with you.

198
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,510
You are so matured, but still we all have to decide that

199
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,640
now we are going to India to get ourselves the whole joy

200
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,670
of the tour - but for what?

201
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,690
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it with others.

202
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,540
This joy is for you to share it with others.

203
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,480
Unless and until you learn that, your ego

204
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,700
will come back again and again.

205
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,480
And also you have seen the way people who have been

206
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,600
even spreading Sahaja Yoga got into the mess of ego.

207
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,660
So one has to be very careful.

208
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,690
The more you are rising in your divinity,

209
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,600
the more you are maturing, you have to be very careful.

210
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,710
See on a tree if you see, if there's a leaf no insect will enter.

211
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,570
If there's a flower, the insect will come

212
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,660
and it will make it into a fruit.

213
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,720
But when it is a fruit, then the insect will enter and eat it off.

214
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,580
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have to be very careful

215
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,640
that no insect should get into you.

216
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,580
On the contrary, now you have the capacity to destroy

217
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,530
all of the insects.

218
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,560
And that is what is, I would say, is the state where we should

219
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,550
all come up to.

220
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,690
So you are destroying insects on one side and

221
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,510
satisfying people on the other side.

222
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,670
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is the only way

223
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,710
you can be cleansed, but the greater thing is to go out, all out,

224
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,660
to find out where can I spread Sahaja Yoga - where can I go,

225
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,710
what is the nearest village I can go, where will I work it out.

226
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,590
All of those things the more you think the better it is and

227
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,510
you start moving in that direction.

228
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,690
Once you start moving in that direction, you will be surprised

229
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,480
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

230
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,480
You'll meet the people whom who want,

231
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,500
you'll get all the necessary help that you want,

232
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,610
suddenly you'll find some people who'll come down

233
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,490
and say "now what can we do for you."

234
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,530
Every type of help starts coming to you the way

235
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,710
you expand yourself.

236
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,580
Its like the expanding your wings, like a bird does,

237
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,710
and then you take off.

238
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,560
But if you don't extend yourself, you keep Sahaja Yoga

239
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,650
to yourself only, it doesn't work.

240
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,520
I know you love me very much and you know

241
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,610
I love you very much, but don't you think others should

242
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,620
also share this love.

243
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,700
Others should also have this.

244
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,680
Now when we start struggling, we also struggle with people

245
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
who are very difficult - like my brother, my brother's son...

246
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,690
Just don't go near "my", get away.

247
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,650
"My" is the most difficult thing. You see in my family,

248
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,660
I don't touch them because once you go to "my" they sit

249
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,490
on your heads, or maybe they'll sit on the heads

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,690
of the Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

251
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,620
So don't go to the people - it is my sister,

252
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,530
she's my sister in law, nothing of the kind.

253
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,660
What you have to do is to see what is beyond

254
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,570
and the more you'll go beyond the better it will be.

255
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,710
See you can see clearly, we have worked so had in Maharashtra

256
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,500
it is a useless place I find.

257
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,640
Maharashtran Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

258
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,520
but whatever are there are also not so good.

259
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,530
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here in Madras, in Bangalore,

260
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,620
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

261
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,480
So much work I have done there.

262
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,700
So those who are very near to you, always cannot see

263
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,570
the greatness of you.

264
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,700
Like if you go near the big mountain you cannot see

265
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,670
the big mountain, you have to be away and then you see.

266
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,650
In the same way, when you want to do some work with anyone,

267
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,540
try to see that you are not closely related nor do you have

268
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,700
any connections with them.

269
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,620
Something unknown.

270
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,500
These people are much better for you to follow and they

271
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,670
will keep your attention tight, absolutely.

272
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,510
Otherwise the people who are known to you will trouble you.

273
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,530
Now there are many difficulties in spreading Sahaja Yoga -

274
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,690
there were many many more before,

275
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,590
slowly these are coming down.

276
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,620
Naturally it is much better than at the time of Thomas

277
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,660
because he had to hide his treatise to save it from others.

278
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,550
He thought a day will come when there will be resurrection time,

279
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,500
then this treatise would be revealed.

280
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,560
Imagine, only 48 years back,

281
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,590
now it would be around 53 or 50 years back, it was discovered.

282
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,570
It was not discovered before. He had to hide it.

283
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,500
But now we are not to hide.

284
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,490
We are to go all out and must know, must forgive.

285
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,540
That, you see, ours is an open place where anybody can come in.

286
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,570
So we get all kinds of people - if you go and meet people

287
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,580
also there is all kinds of oppositions, all these things,

288
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,580
doesn't matter.

289
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,650
Everything can be overcome but first is your own initiative

290
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,600
and your own lethargy which has to be overcome.

291
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,550
Then it will start spreading out. Of course we have already

292
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,490
lot of Sahaja Yogis - in Russia, we say we have so many

293
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,650
in thousands.

294
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,510
But in every place we can have lots of people now and I'm sure

295
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,640
this is a nice year where they say so predict that

296
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,610
Sahaja Yoga will grow very much this year.

297
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,500
So this is the beginning we are starting today.

298
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,520
I just wanted to tell you that you have the power,

299
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,500
you have the Shakti within your reach.

300
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,560
They said it was very cold one day before I came here,

301
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,620
I said don't worry - I didn't give bandhan or anything.

302
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,570
I just came here and how they know. It's become all right,

303
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,530
you are sitting in your kurta pyjamas.

304
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,650
Otherwise you would have been in your three piece

305
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,520
suits shivering. That's how it works.

306
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,620
But you have to be that way dedicated.

307
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,540
Now for all these Surya [Sun] and Chandra [Moon] and all these

308
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,480
stars and whole cosmos has only one thing to do -

309
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,580
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading well,

310
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,530
is settling well and is achieving it's goal.

311
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,640
Every element is working it out.

312
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,680
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya is working around

313
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,500
so many ways.

314
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,630
You are not to be convinced about Me I know.

315
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,480
But now you have to be convinced about yourself

316
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,530
that you have all the powers within you.

317
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,630
I mean I don't do anything really to be very frank.

318
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,590
If I could do everything, I would not have had it,

319
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,650
I would have done it myself.

320
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,700
But you have to do it - you are My channels.

321
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,500
You are the channels of Shakti.

322
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,630
But do it in a way which is gracious, which is beautiful,

323
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,580
which is very satisfying.

324
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,720
Like yesterday, that musician -

325
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,640
he just wanted to entertain you.

326
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,580
He wanted to play.

327
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,720
Even he was enjoying it.

328
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,690
In the same way we should want to do it.

329
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,600
I don't have to tell you.

330
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:08,680
And I am sure, in every area that you work, in every personality

331
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,550
whom you meet, you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga

332
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,530
and tell them. It works. It acts.

333
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,700
Moreover it is behind you, the whole power of all the deities

334
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,520
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running forward fast,

335
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,490
this Paramchaitanya.

336
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,590
Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming, all right, let them not eat

337
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,540
their food, finished, organize it.

338
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,540
Everything so beautifully done.

339
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,630
Now see the arrangements - I mean I was thinking

340
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,580
such few people here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

341
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,720
can you believe it, all this arrangement.

342
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,590
How it's working out.

343
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,600
How it is giving results, it's really remarkable.

344
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,550
So have faith in yourself, have faith in all of Them helping you

345
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,640
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

346
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,540
Because the Shakti is in you. You have the Power.

347
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,540
Every kind of Power you have, I assure you,

348
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,700
you have every power.

349
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,530
Ask for It and you'll have It.

350
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,700
Whatever you ask for, you'll have It.

351
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,680
But don't hesitate. As I said the other day, that I beg you

352
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:33,550
sit on the throne and also I put the crown on your head.

353
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,700
And also I say that you are the king but still you are running

354
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,490
away and not believing Me - looking this side with fear -

355
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,590
"Am I a king, really how can I be?"

356
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,640
That's not the way. Have faith in yourself.

357
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,620
I'm very happy you all have come here.

358
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,680
We are trying to do whatever is possible to make you

359
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:05,680
comfortable and for you to provide whatever is necessary.

360
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:13,590
Of course you are only just spirits and you try to find

361
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,680
the comfort of your spirit.

362
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,690
I know that you are very adjusting yourself.

363
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,510
Everybody is surprised how you people from the West

364
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,530
who just believe in materialism can take to Sahaja Yoga -

365
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,560
they are quite surprised.

366
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,650
But you are all very sweet people, I think something

367
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,550
very special who have come to Sahaja Yoga.

368
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,480
And by God's grace, I'm sure you will be the people

369
00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:00,480
who will be the foundation of Sahaja Yoga and you will build

370
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:11,500
the great mansion of Sahaja Yoga with your wisdom, faith,

371
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,540
shakti and love.

372
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,590
Today we'll worship the Shakti - very much needed - the Shakti

373
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,540
who destroyed all the devils, all the rakshasas.

374
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,520
That is what you are going to worship today -

375
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,690
the Shakti within you and without.

376
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,480
It's your desire which is going to work.

377
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,720
So today we are going to worship the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

378
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,530
May God bless you.

379
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,500
So, today first will have the washing of Feet

380
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,480
and with that will have

381
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,530
one Atharva Shirsha we'll do

382
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,500
and then we can have thousand names,

383
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,550
which have made very easily

384
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,720
compiled together by the noida people,

385
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,700
which you can sing.

386
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,480
That's how we can worship the Shakti.
