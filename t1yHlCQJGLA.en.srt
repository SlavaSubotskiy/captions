00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,049
Shri Ganesha Puja
Canberra, Australia

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,049
April 14, 1991

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,670
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,690
we should have the Ganesha Puja.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,719
Is very important also, very helpful.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,250
We all should have Ganesha Puja, it’s very
important.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,789
And so today there will be Shri Ganesha Puja.

8
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:17,906
Have you got the hundred and eight names of
Shri Ganesha?

9
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:18,906
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra.

10
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:19,906
And he has agreed.

11
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:26,970
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,720
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:50,190
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:58,070
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,432
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

16
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:12,300
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:21,830
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:28,070
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,260
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,500
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

21
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,090
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

22
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,500
behave yourself.

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:01,500
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created 
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,880
into hell.

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:15,610
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:26,780
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:36,120
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,120
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,319
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

30
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,790
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

31
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,760
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,190
They have no moral values left in them.

33
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:13,319
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

34
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,690
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

35
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:27,959
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

36
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:37,290
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

37
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,459
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

38
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:55,540
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

39
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:07,410
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

40
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,050
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

41
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,630
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

42
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:26,129
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

43
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:34,030
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

44
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:40,410
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

45
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,590
So he wanted to see her.

46
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,270
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

47
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:58,309
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

48
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:04,650
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

49
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,729
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

50
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,300
fall on me directly.”

51
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,400
She agreed to that.

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:22,199
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

53
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,360
her to be.

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,599
So now he wanted to have her.

55
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,660
So physical, so superficial.

56
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,139
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

57
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,780
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

58
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,780
or not.”

59
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,780
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

60
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,490
We are not going to surrender.”

61
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:56,650
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

62
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,569
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

63
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,479
They could not bear the idea.

64
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,629
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

65
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:16,159
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

66
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,879
And they sent hundred palanquins.

67
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,460
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

68
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,569
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

69
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,830
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

70
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,129
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

71
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,180
It was a small kingdom.

72
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,520
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

73
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
“The queen is coming.”

74
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,020
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

75
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,409
“The queen is coming.

76
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,409
Queen is coming.”

77
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,029
So they were half drunk also.

78
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:02,339
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

79
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,440
that we have won.

80
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,639
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

81
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,080
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

82
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,149
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

83
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,749
king came out and they all fought those people.

84
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:30,830
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

85
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,770
weapons, so they were killed.

86
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,300
They did not lit the fire.

87
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,559
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

88
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:44,149
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

89
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:50,889
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

90
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,499
they made a big pyre on that.

91
00:07:52,499 --> 00:08:03,129
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

92
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:10,599
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

93
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,729
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

94
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,939
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

95
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,080
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

96
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,789
of perverted relations, incest relations.

97
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:38,550
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

98
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,010
relationship.

99
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:48,120
It’s hell that we have created.

100
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,290
In hell what else is going to be?

101
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,090
Same thing.

102
00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:00,100
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

103
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:09,180
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

104
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,839
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

105
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,970
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

106
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,510
They are made of innocence.

107
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,600
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

108
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,579
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

109
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:40,680
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

110
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,769
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

111
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,300
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

112
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,529
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

113
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,940
You can see it so clearly.

114
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:09,220
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

115
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,519
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

116
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:25,399
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

117
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,990
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

118
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,990
our head.

119
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,860
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

120
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,160
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

121
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,470
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

122
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:58,430
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

123
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,279
to come in.

124
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,269
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

125
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,329
will be there.

126
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:15,339
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

127
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,440
absolutely.

128
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,519
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

129
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,530
someone like us.

130
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,670
Let’s go enter them.”

131
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,430
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

132
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,709
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

133
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,480
Don’t cover your Agnya.

134
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,250
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

135
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,860
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

136
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,820
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

137
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,470
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

138
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,500
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

139
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,700
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

140
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:12,671
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

141
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:20,660
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

142
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:29,670
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

143
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,860
is innate within us.

144
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,480
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

145
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,949
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

146
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:53,110
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

147
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,620
we try to flout, because ego is there.

148
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,819
“What’s wrong?”

149
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,420
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

150
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,379
And you do not know how devastating it is.

151
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:14,579
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

152
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,319
they have got already children.

153
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:28,279
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they 

154
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,279
have got children.

155
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,300
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

156
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,639
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

157
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,990
things in such details in the newspaper.

158
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,790
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

159
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,519
But basically we are good people.

160
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,930
God has created us good human beings.

161
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:09,079
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

162
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:15,209
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

163
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:20,499
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

164
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:24,579
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

165
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,120
“Why they behave like this?”

166
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,300
I just don’t understand.

167
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:37,610
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

168
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,320
all these jattas, as we call them.

169
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,010
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

170
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,959
You look like a primitive man.”

171
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,259
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

172
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,209
I said, “You cannot.

173
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,860
Your brain is modern.

174
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,649
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

175
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,269
You cannot become primitive.”

176
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,250
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

177
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,300
For what?

178
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,930
To have an identity.

179
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:11,310
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

180
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,310
You can do anything.

181
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,550
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

182
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,310
I mean, there are no maryadas.

183
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,430
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

184
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,380
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

185
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,550
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

186
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:40,430
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

187
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,720
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

188
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,139
She knows that it’s wrong.

189
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,449
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

190
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:57,410
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

191
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,529
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

192
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,189
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

193
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,999
This is the situation of the wisdom.

194
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,899
This is really shocking.

195
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,200
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

196
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,149
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

197
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,519
For that the best is to meditate.

198
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:32,069
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

199
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,069
Sit on that.

200
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:40,839
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

201
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:41,910
Sheersha.

202
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,499
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

203
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:50,610
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

204
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,809
It’s going to help you very much.

205
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:57,839
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

206
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,809
very nice.

207
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:07,470
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

208
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,470
her husband.

209
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,400
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

210
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,880
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

211
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,770
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

212
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:30,560
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

213
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,710
of stupid things like that.

214
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,660
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

215
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,430
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

216
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,760
seven queens who were killed.

217
00:17:47,760 --> 00:18:09,920
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

218
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:54,030
So it’s not a 

219
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,910
something very simple thing.

220
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,600
It’s very serious.

221
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,720
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

222
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,470
They have to revive their innocence.

223
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,780
They have to revive their maryadas.

224
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,830
They have to delimit themselves.

225
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,370
It’s very important.

226
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:26,420
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

227
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,930
the heights?

228
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,590
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

229
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,590
Only by maryadas you can rise.

230
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,100
Of course the kundalini will help.

231
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,520
Of course Ganesha will help also.

232
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,720
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

233
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,920
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

234
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:01,240
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

235
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,480
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

236
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,040
not higher than that.

237
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,710
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

238
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:26,430
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

239
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:33,100
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

240
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,620
it, but is accepted.

241
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:44,050
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

242
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,130
one sin, so I must tell you.”

243
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,130
I said, “What?”

244
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,050
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

245
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:57,780
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

246
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:06,190
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

247
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,760
touch beer.”

248
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Imagine.

249
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,840
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

250
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,610
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

251
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,610
What is it?

252
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,820
You are all making money?”

253
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,310
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

254
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,440
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

255
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,350
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

256
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,350
Why not?”

257
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,480
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

258
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,670
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

259
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,050
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

260
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:50,220
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

261
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,520
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

262
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,550
It’s very difficult.

263
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,400
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

264
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,080
that we can fit into them.”

265
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,560
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

266
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
It’s easy.

267
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
They are your style only.”

268
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,350
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

269
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,610
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

270
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,010
India is like that, you see.

271
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,740
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

272
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,920
So you are like that and they are like that.

273
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,110
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

274
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,730
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

275
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,880
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

276
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,260
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

277
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,830
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

278
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:57,990
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

279
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,380
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

280
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,080
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

281
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,880
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

282
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:22,030
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

283
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:30,950
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

284
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:37,270
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

285
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:45,530
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

286
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,280
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

287
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,370
What else do they want?

288
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,970
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

289
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,510
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

290
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:08,100
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

291
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,200
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

292
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:23,440
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

293
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,980
special people?

294
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:37,890
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

295
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,290
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

296
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:48,520
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

297
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,650
principle, which should be very easy for you.

298
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,320
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

299
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,870
It has come down here.

300
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,570
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

301
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:15,080
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

302
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,490
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

303
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,540
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

304
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,340
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

305
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,420
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

306
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,450
A person is known by his maryadas.

307
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,910
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

308
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,950
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

309
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,360
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

310
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,490
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

311
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:58,370
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

312
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,820
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

313
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:11,990
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

314
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:19,020
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

315
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,060
fragrant.

316
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,990
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

317
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:37,040
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

318
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,010
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

319
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,280
May God bless you.
