1
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,800
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

2
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,000
In the center He resides as Shri Krishna.

3
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,480
On the left-hand side His power, Vishnumaya, His sister, resides.

4
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,200
There He resides as Gopala,

5
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,680
as the one who lived in Gokul played as a child.

6
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,360
On a right-hand side He resides

7
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,520
as the king who ruled in Dwarika, the king Shri Krishna.

8
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,880
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi Chakra.

9
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,320
The people who use their right side to dominate others,

10
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,600
use their voice to put down people,

11
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
to show their authority,

12
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,400
shout at people,

13
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,240
are the people who get affected by the right side.

14
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,480
The right side is caught up

15
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,840
on the physical side you get a very big problem,

16
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,040
because the Right Heart cannot work out its flow.

17
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,560
So you get what you call asthma and all these diseases.

18
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,000
But specially when the Right Heart is affected

19
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,520
by the fathers problem.

20
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,720
On the left side is the Vishnumaya,

21
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,720
is the sisterly relationship.

22
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,880
When the sister who is your pure relation

23
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,200
is not treated as the sister,

24
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,560
when the attitude of a person towards women

25
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
is of indulgence and of lust,

26
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,920
then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

27
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,680
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very strongly

28
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,560
and if he has a bad Agya of he has eyes which are roving eyes,

29
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,200
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot of trouble.

30
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,760
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you know,

31
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,680
by feeling guilty about things for nothing at all.

32
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

33
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,320
But Vishuddhi Chakra has a specialty.

34
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,640
When the humane beings raised their head upward

35
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,920
from Mother Earth towards the sky,

36
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,200
sky is, ether is Shri Krishna's nature,

37
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,280
when it raises head towards the ether, towards the sky,

38
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,480
then this Vishuddhi Chakra developed into a different dimension

39
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,000
and people started developing ego and superego.

40
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,200
Superego was already developed,

41
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,120
but ego developed in such a way,

42
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,880
that it started suppressing the superego.

43
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,480
That's how you have got conditionings on one side

44
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other side.

45
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,800
When I told you the other day that you give up your free will

46
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,440
in the sense that when you raised your head

47
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,440
you did it through your free will with your power of growing,

48
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,800
that you had as animals.

49
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
After that now you have reached to the humane level.

50
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,600
And to rise above the humane level now

51
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
you have to do is to seek your complete freedom.

52
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,960
And for that Vishuddhi Chakra is going to help you a lot.

53
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,400
On this Vishuddhi Chakra we have to really pay full attention.

54
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,080
It is such a complicated Chakra.

55
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,280
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari's script

56
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,560
emitting out of the sound

57
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,720
of the shakti that is passing through it,

58
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,480
of the Kundalini that is passing through it.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,080
So all the vowels are heard on these Chakras.

60
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,920
These vowels are, as you know, sixteen in number.

61
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,400
Without the vowel

62
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,800
in the Devanagari you cannot write anything.

63
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Vowels are the sustenance,

64
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,600
are the power that

65
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,240
supports every consonant.

66
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,720
So it's very important that our vowels

67
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,840
have to be fully nourished and respected.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
The movement of the neck,

69
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,120
as you have seen in all international life,

70
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,160
if you see, everybody has practically the same.

71
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Even those who cannot hear,

72
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,560
those who do not understand your language,

73
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,560
you can nod like this,

74
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,760
can say, "No", like this.

75
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,680
Everyone understand this is "Yes" or "No".

76
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,640
In some particular area

77
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,080
of course they have little different type of nodding.

78
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,480
But too much of nodding of head is not a very good sign.

79
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
I have seen people in the West,

80
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,160
if you tell them something

81
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
to show that they appreciated it,

82
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,920
they'll go on for quite some time.

83
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,680
That's not necessary.

84
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,040
Just have to say, "Alright", or "I've understood it", that's all.

85
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
You have to use your voice

86
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,160
instead of nodding like this all the time.

87
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,800
Is very bad, very-very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.

88
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Or some of them are the other way round.

89
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
That whatever it is they'll put up their head like this

90
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
and they won't talk properly,

91
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
they will not say a word, they'll just keep quiet.

92
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,560
You may go on pinching them, doing anything, they won't badge.

93
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,400
This kind of personality is also very much detrimental

94
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
to the growth of their evolution.

95
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a very big problem.

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,000
Because of Vishuddhi there are so many problems.

97
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Like angina you develop because of Vishuddhi.

98
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,560
You develop spondylosis because of Vishuddhi.

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,680
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

100
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,520
Sometimes they have all the time coughing.

101
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,720
And there are so many physical problems

102
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,960
out of Vishuddhi because, as I said,

103
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,640
this a very-very complicated center,

104
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,080
which looks after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteenth

105
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,960
sub plexuses are there, which are looked after by this center.

106
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,120
But above all is the center of discrimination.

107
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,320
The center of discrimination only comes when you are free people.

108
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Till you are biased, till you have your own concept,

109
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
you cannot be discrete.

110
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
And that's the one point where one must understand

111
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,360
that to achieve your complete freedom,

112
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,240
you have to get your Vishuddhi Chakra cleared out.

113
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,640
First and foremost thing is that we must speak in a sweet manner,

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,760
speak to someone in a sweet manner,

115
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,400
not artificially, but sweetly.

116
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Speak in a manner that another person likes it.

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Saptyam vadeyt, priyam vadeyt.

118
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,480
Speak the truth, don't tell the lies.

119
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,400
If you go on telling lies after some time,

120
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,360
even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.

121
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
But if you are telling the truth,

122
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,360
that even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

123
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,280
Now some people

124
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,000
think that they can be cunning,

125
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,760
by their talks they can cheat people.

126
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,520
But actually they are cheating themselves.

127
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,320
All such people who cheat others

128
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,120
by sweet talks, by artificial talks

129
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,200
or by some maneuvering

130
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
go to such a horrible state

131
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
and in this Kali Yuga specially they are cursed

132
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
and they get exposed and people know about them,

133
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,760
that these are the greatest liars ever known.

134
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
Now the times are coming

135
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,040
when all such people will be exposed

136
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,520
very much more than they have been ever exposed.

137
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,120
So be careful not to think that you can cheat.

138
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,760
In Sahaja Yoga specially you cannot cheat.

139
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,480
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,

140
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,200
"We can befool Mother, we can some or other carry on.

141
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,600
If we see in front of Mother She won't know, what we are up to".

142
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,880
Is not so.

143
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
I may not say, I may use My discretion not to say,

144
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
I may allow you to have a long way, but be careful.

145
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Do not come into My illusions,

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm very illusive.

147
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,040
And when I play My illusions you will suddenly find yourself

148
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,040
in a very difficult situation and then you will say,

149
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
"Mother, why am I in this situation?"

150
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,960
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna

151
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,240
that He is the one who becomes illusive.

152
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
And His illusiveness not cunning but illusive.

153
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,120
In His illusiveness He exposes people to themselves.

154
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,680
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,240
in which He had illusively acted to give

156
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,200
greater joy to some people,

157
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,600
to give nice lessons to some people

158
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,640
and sometimes to punish.

159
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,880
For us it is important, that we are Sahaja Yogis,

160
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
in this lifetime we have a chance

161
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,640
our Kundalini has risen,

162
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,640
that we can face ourselves,

163
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,720
that we can correct our chakras,

164
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,400
that we know about ourselves,

165
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,480
that we know where is the problem is.

166
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,960
I've known of people who were caught up with left Vishuddhis

167
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,560
and have become devilish by nature, devilish.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,560
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

169
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,680
they have criticized Sahaja Yoga,

170
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
they have tried to trouble Me a lot.

171
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
So don't think that if Vishuddhi is spoiled

172
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,280
there's nothing so special about it.

173
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,280
It can be a very dangerous center.

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,560
Of course, Heart, Agya and Vishuddhi, these three centers

175
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,680
one has to guard against

176
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,960
because three of them can allow you

177
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,200
or can force you to become one with identification

178
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,600
of evil as your own.

179
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,600
You might just feel that it's nice to be evil;

180
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,720
you might just feel that it is a great fun to be evil

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,160
and you might become evil.

182
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,360
So at the Vishuddhi Chakra one has to be extremely careful.

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,680
Vishuddhi Chakra you looks after so many things,

184
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,080
specially your skin, your eyes.

185
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,040
Skin is now I've seen people who have bad Vishuddhi

186
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,080
can have all kinds of funny troubles with their skins.

187
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Of course, it has to do with your liver,

188
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,800
but skin is the way it shines,

189
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,640
the way it glows,

190
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,720
depends on how you smile,

191
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,880
how you look at the world.

192
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing at all.

193
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Specially women I have seen, ladies I have seen,

194
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,120
they just smile stupidly.

195
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,320
That's not [inaudible], one should not be stupid.

196
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,320
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna's principle.

197
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,720
Like you have seen the stupid people, how they are.

198
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,320
Their tongue is always halfway out.

199
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,560
If you have noticed the stupid man,

200
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,480
his face is that, his tongue is always out,

201
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,480
mouth half open and he looks like a dumbfound fool.

202
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,600
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

203
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,640
Another one is the one where

204
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,920
you get the Vishddhi's straits.

205
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,680
So such a person has very purse lips,

206
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,400
angry lips and he doesn't talk.

207
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,560
The another one might even get the expression of an idiot,

208
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,360
but could be just making a face like that.

209
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,320
Because if he's cunning he may take a

210
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,680
I would say a kind of a

211
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,560
rupa or... (yogi: "Mask").

212
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
Mask you can say, a mask on his face,

213
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,280
that he is an idiot and make high to deceive you.

214
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,520
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

215
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,720
Whatever may be the expression of a person,

216
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,040
a person may look very innocent.

217
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,920
Because that's the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

218
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,400
You are free because you've raised your head

219
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,640
and this point you have achieved, this kind of a special aptitude

220
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,440
that you can deceive yourself and you can deceive others.

221
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,840
Some people look extremely innocent on the face.

222
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,560
They may look to be very simple people,

223
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,520
but may turn out to be horrid.

224
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,640
Some people may look to be idiotic,

225
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,560
but may be very intelligent.

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi

227
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,720
which is, which is responsible.

228
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,680
But the main thing what I'm trying to tell you,

229
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi.

230
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
The way you want to put your expression,

231
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,280
the way want you make your face,

232
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,440
the way you want to suggest something,

233
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,600
all you can maneuver

234
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,880
and you can keep your heart away from it.

235
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,480
In the heart you may have poison for a person,

236
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,040
but outwardly you may say

237
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
to that person in a very sweet manner something

238
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,960
that a person might feel impressed.

239
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,080
But in this all this behavior, pattern of behavior,

240
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,360
you are deceiving yourself, not deceiving the another person.

241
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,760
Because yourself is Spirit,

242
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,280
which knows you very well.

243
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,680
And this will go on and on

244
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
for all your lives that have to come.

245
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,320
So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression,

246
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,200
there is no need to hide anything in your expression.

247
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,480
Of course, I mean, if you don't like someone

248
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,400
you need not just say, "I don't like you",

249
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,560
but in that case you have to be

250
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,800
not also so much appreciative of the person,

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,760
that he's deluded into your appreciation.

252
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,760
Now, eyes are very important

253
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
and eyes in a way are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

254
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,760
because the muscles of the eyes

255
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,720
are looked after by Vishuddhi.

256
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
And the kind of the muscles we have

257
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,640
which pull our eyes,

258
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,360
which close our eyelids and all that is very much suggestive.

259
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,320
You must noticed that there are some people who come to Me,

260
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,200
their eyes go on like this.

261
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,600
When they close their eyes, they cannot keep it shut.

262
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,160
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me

263
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,920
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

264
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,720
Both are in trouble.

265
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,360
The ones which are the ones,

266
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,800
which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

267
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,920
are the people having supraconscious.

268
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,560
And those who flicking their eyes are having the subconscious.

269
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,720
Some people have also

270
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,120
habit of eh keeping the eyes in an angle all the time

271
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,480
they never see you straight,

272
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,800
but in angle they'll see.

273
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,320
Ah, they think it's sometimes it's very fashionable sometimes,

274
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,880
ladies think it's a very good way of looking at people

275
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,160
and some of them have such eyes

276
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
that they'll go on and looking and boring

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,680
their greedy eyes onto others,

278
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,960
or their lusty eyes onto others.

279
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,920
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes,

280
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,880
because such people are easily can become blind.

281
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
Such people might have trouble of the eyes.

282
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Specially reddening of the eyes

283
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,520
can come to such people

284
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,840
very much, very quickly.

285
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,400
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure.

286
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,280
The eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

287
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,160
He was a witness,

288
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,000
He, He was on this Earth,

289
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,480
He play, He played with Radha. He married five women,

290
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,360
they were the five elements.

291
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,440
Sixteen thousand women He married,

292
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,480
they were His sixteen thousand powers,

293
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
but He was Yogeshwara.

294
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
He was Yogeshwara;

295
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,400
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them, at all.

296
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,480
He was beyond them, He was Yogeshwara.

297
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,600
That was the testing point of His,

298
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,240
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

299
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,280
Such an Yogeshwara is there!

300
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,120
Of course, I don't expect you to be Shri Krishna.

301
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,440
But you have your wife.

302
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,280
Those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

303
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,480
That we'll get wives and will be,

304
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,560
ah, we'll have a wife and think of a wife,

305
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,880
who will be your own

306
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,000
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

307
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,160
who comes across ah with that kind of a thing.

308
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,480
I've seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

309
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,080
it's surprising, I mean, there's nothing in the photograph,

310
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,200
what is in a photograph?

311
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,840
But even a photograph can attract their attention,

312
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,720
I mean, I don't know what can attract their attention like this.

313
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,080
But they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes.

314
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,720
No control, they become absolutely lost and they have no control.

315
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,360
That shows that they have no powers in them

316
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,440
and they are slaves of their responses.

317
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,360
For the eyes are very-very important as Christ has said,

318
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,360
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

319
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,920
There should be no adultery.

320
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,640
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see.

321
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,320
If they have to show anger with their eyes

322
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,960
they'll just go on looking like this and show the anger.

323
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,480
I need there not do that to you, but.

324
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,400
And the angry eyes you see are another dangerous things

325
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,840
to do with your eyes,

326
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,160
because then they can become mesmeric.

327
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,880
If you start putting your eyes onto something

328
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,280
and concentrating on it your eyes might become mesmeric

329
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

330
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
First of all you'll catch bhoots in your eyes,

331
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,920
they'll settle down there and then

332
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,520
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

333
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,600
It's a very-very dangerous thing

334
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,960
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

335
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,600
There's another kind of a stupid thing or a bhootish thing maybe,

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,240
that people ask you to meditate here. It's absolutely wrong.

337
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

338
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
Nobody should put attention here.

339
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,480
Instead of put attention, put attention at the door.

340
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,320
What's the use of looking at a window?

341
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
You can't get out of it, can you?

342
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,200
If you have to look at anything be on a lookout for the door.

343
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,120
And the door is here.

344
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,680
The door of Sahasrara is to be open out.

345
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,480
So you should not try to concentrate on this path.

346
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,600
Many people who have concentrated on this path have become mad.

347
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
When they become mad, people say,

348
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,720
"These are Yogi but has got [SOUNDS LIKE - unmanitasha]."

349
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,520
That he moves like a madcap.

350
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,960
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

351
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,960
That means he's united with God. Is He mad?

352
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
All such mad people are really mad,

353
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,720
they've nothing to do with God, definitely.

354
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,040
But there are people who believe in such things,

355
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,120
"Oh, he is in love with God,"

356
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,760
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into ecstasy,

357
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
dances like a madcap.

358
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,800
How can God be mad?

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,520
First position is this that the sanest personality is God,

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
has to be.

361
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
From where do the sanity comes?

362
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,320
So this is one thing one has to understand,

363
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,200
that any such practices

364
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,320
can lead you to lunacy and one should not doing.

365
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,640
Thirdly in the indiscretion that one has

366
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,480
comes from people who are good hearted, nice people,

367
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,080
but they get kind away by the smiles of others

368
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,320
or by the artificial goodness they show on their faces.

369
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,240
I've known some people, they always have a face like

370
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,600
as if they are all the time smiling.

371
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,160
No, I can't do that way.

372
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,000
All the time if you look at someone like this, you see.

373
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,920
It means as if you are mocking at the person.

374
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,520
And there are people I've seen who just like this

375
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,160
all the time have them [lips] like this.

376
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
So, one should not be always in one pose.

377
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,400
Sometimes this muscles can get very weak

378
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,800
and start paining if you take one.

379
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,880
There are some others

380
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,920
who always try to show they are very miserable.

381
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't know what do they want to attract.

382
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,000
Attract the attention of others,

383
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,640
attract ah the bhoots in themselves

384
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,640
or I don't know what are they up to,

385
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,280
why can't they keep a normal face.

386
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,240
Even while sitting in dhaan, or meditation,

387
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,720
I've seen that trying to show Me or may whatever it is,

388
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,040
because My eyes are mostly closed, but doesn't matter.

389
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,720
When I open My eyes I find some people like this, like that.

390
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,160
Why? What is the need? You have to have a balanced face.

391
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,280
That's what Shri Krishna had described the Sthita Pragya,

392
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,400
One who is balanced,

393
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,600
who doesn't laugh like an idiot,

394
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
who laughs, but not like an idiot.

395
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,240
Nor he's a serious like another kind of an idiot.

396
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,320
So both the things are not at all

397
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,840
expression of your inner being.

398
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,400
Such a person is, as I told you today,

399
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,440
is not frivolous, but not serious either,

400
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,400
but full of joy within himself.

401
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,200
He doesn't want you to be unhappy,

402
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
never would like that you should be unhappy people.

403
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,240
But human beings if they want to be unhappy,

404
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
what can anybody help,

405
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,840
because they have got the free will to be unhappy.

406
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,920
They have got a free will to cut their nose,

407
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,080
they've a free will to cut their ears,

408
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,760
they've a free will to commit suicide.

409
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,560
They have this free will so-called.

410
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,160
Now the greatest freewill comes from Vishuddhi Chakra,

411
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,080
as I told you and that's why we call Him Yogeshwara,

412
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,800
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

413
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,720
The establishment of Yoga is possible

414
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,400
when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

415
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,600
Completely surrenders yourself to Shri Krishna.

416
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,400
Your Yoga will be established. Means what?

417
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,160
Means all your balances will be established.

418
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,880
You go into complete balance

419
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,400
and that balance is complete because Vishnu,

420
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Who is the Incarnation for sustaining the dharma,

421
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,040
Who is responsible for giving you the balance,

422
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,760
becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna.

423
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
That's why He said that, "You leave all the dharmas

424
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,080
[SOUNDS LIKE - sarva dharma nam partitte jam ma meik shana wraja]",

425
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,480
that's why surrender all of them to Me.

426
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,960
So all the dharmas if you put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna,

427
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,880
means if you follow His ideals,

428
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,520
then all your dharmas are balanced.

429
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,880
But after Realization you go beyond dharma.

430
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,400
Whenever you go wrong in dharma,

431
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
[SOUNDS LIKE - dharmatchutta] as they call it,

432
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,480
when you go wrong in dharma,

433
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,600
that's the time you have to surrender yourself to Shri Krishna,

434
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,360
so that He establishes your dharma.

435
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,480
There are so many dharmas.

436
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,720
There is the pati dharm -

437
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,760
husbands dharma, patni dharma - wive's dharma,

438
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,600
father's dharma, mother's dharma, son's dharmas,

439
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,280
the [SOUNDS LIKE - rashtra] dharma - means the nations dharma.

440
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,040
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also

441
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,960
of we can say ah where one has to bow

442
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,200
to the higher things of life.

443
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,960
But then He says, "[SOUNDS LIKE - Sarva dharma anam pari tedg]"

444
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,840
"Forget all the dharmas."

445
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,400
"[SOUNDS LIKE-Maa meikam charanam gachchhami ]", -

446
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,280
"Just surrender your dharmas, all of them to Me",

447
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
that is at Vishuddhi.

448
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,400
At Vishuddhi Chakra you surrender all your other dharmas.

449
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,920
It means that it all gets sublimated,

450
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,760
it all gets complete, the wholesomeness is achieved

451
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,400
because He is collective being,

452
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
He is the Virat,

453
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,160
because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas

454
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,200
and He is the Virata in our brain.

455
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,960
He represents our brain.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,760
And when this Virat in us is awakened fully,

457
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,880
then all the dharmas become natural with us.

458
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,600
We don't have to do any dharmas,

459
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
we don't have to be conscious of any dharmas,

460
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,360
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

461
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,320
For example, there are people now, say, Christ;

462
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,720
we can take example of Christ.

463
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,720
He was dharma personified.

464
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,880
He would not steal money from anybody, will He?

465
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,680
Will He run away with somebody's wife, will He?

466
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,560
When He do anything wrong? No, He cannot.

467
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,360
Why? Because He was Dharma.

468
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,480
So now you have become dharmateet,

469
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,520
means you have entered into the kingdom of God,

470
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
into the Virata's conditions

471
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
and there your condition is such that your state is such,

472
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,040
your state is such, that you are dharma.

473
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,360
If you try to do adharma, you'll suffer.

474
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
If you try to do wrong, you'll suffer.

475
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,960
Here I don't have to tell you to be righteous;

476
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,240
I don't have to tell you, there's no need.

477
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,280
I don't have to tell you that you tell the truth.

478
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,400
I don't have to tell you, "Don't steal".

479
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,720
I don't have to do all these things.

480
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Only thing I can tell you

481
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,120
that get rid of your ego and superego, that's all.

482
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,280
In a very general terminology.

483
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,560
But you will follow Christ automatically,

484
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
you will follow Krishna automatically, Sahaj,

485
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,480
because now you have gone beyond dharma,

486
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,040
you have crossed the limits of dharma

487
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,200
where you had to follow a dharma,

488
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,560
now you have become the dharma.

489
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Where you will stand, wherever you will be

490
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
dharma will stand with you.

491
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,080
People will look at you and say, "Here is a dharma standing,

492
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,480
he's the dharma to be worshipped".

493
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,600
Not because of anything but because your state

494
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,000
is that of dharma, you have gone beyond that.

495
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,920
Supposing this is loudspeaker I'm using today to talk to you.

496
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,920
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part and parcel of Me,

497
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't have to use this, I go beyond it.

498
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
In the same way

499
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,880
you are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself.

500
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,880
But when you go beyond dharma

501
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,840
into the state of Virata,

502
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,240
then you don't need any dharma,

503
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,640
you become the dharma of Virat.

504
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,560
Now, what is the dharma of Virat,

505
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,680
what is the dharma of Shri Krishna

506
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,360
is collectivity.

507
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,000
Krishna

508
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,040
is the Brain.

509
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Shiva is the Heart

510
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,240
and Brahmadeva is the Liver.

511
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,400
Now what's the faculty of this brain is?

512
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,880
That the tree of life of evolution grows downward as He says.

513
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,240
And this tree is growing downwards

514
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,800
of awareness from the brain.

515
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,560
But if you have to go to the roots

516
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,160
you have to ascend and that ascent you have achieved,

517
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,040
now you have gone to the roots of your brain

518
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,800
where all your roots are enlightened,

519
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
all your nerves are enlightened,

520
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,040
your brain is enlightened,

521
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,000
you are an enlightened person.

522
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,320
When you are in darkness

523
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,280
you may catch hold of a snake as rope,

524
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,080
but when you are in light you will drop it.

525
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,320
In the same way, when you become enlightened,

526
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,200
your dharma is enlightened.

527
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,560
You don't have to take to any guru

528
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,360
or to any book or to anyone,

529
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,840
you know yourself in your own life that this is wrong.

530
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Now the collectivity part of it is very important.

531
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,400
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

532
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,720
Not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all.

533
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,560
Collective in the sense

534
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,600
that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

535
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,200
who tries to find faults with someone all the time,

536
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,120
wants to run away with his wife

537
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,120
and'll stay somewhere else or with her husband,

538
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,360
who wants to get out, is not a person who's collective.

539
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,040
There's no need to say

540
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,440
that, "I cannot live under the circumstances

541
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,000
in which Sahaja Yogis can live".

542
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,440
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if are a Yogi, you can live.

543
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,360
Look at Me, I'm such an old woman, I can live anywhere.

544
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,840
You take Me to a village,

545
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,680
you take Me to any place I'm not bothered

546
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,520
about any physical comforts at all.

547
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,560
Because I'm comfortable within Myself.

548
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,920
My comforts are within.

549
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,400
In the same way, a person who is not collective,

550
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,920
like many people just come to Pujas, that's all.

551
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,560
It's like going to the church only once in Christmas

552
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,280
and then say, "Christ doesn't look after us".

553
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,040
Of course, not going to church and you don't meet Christ,

554
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,560
but I mean to say that just to have a casual way

555
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,040
of Sahaja Yoga you cannot gain.

556
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,280
You have to be collective.

557
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,520
And collective means

558
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,600
that at every collective program you should be there.

559
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,360
You should always meet collectively,

560
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,120
meditate collectively, live collectively,

561
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,560
and try to find ways and methods of being collective.

562
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,840
There are so many evil forces,

563
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,600
which are all the time trying to attack collectivity.

564
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,240
First they will attack the leaders.

565
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
That's the first thing.

566
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Any leader tell somebody, "You shouldn't do like this",

567
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,360
immediately that person will start spreading stories against,

568
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,960
"That leader is very bad, he's like this, he's very harsh.

569
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,160
He didn't garland me, he didn't give me this, that".

570
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,840
How can you garland a bhoot, can you?

571
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,520
That if that in that ah doesn't work out

572
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,160
then they have their sly methods

573
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,120
of going round and talking something here and there

574
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
in the ears to create some sort of a politics.

575
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,320
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

576
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
As there is a centrifugal and a centripetal force,

577
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
both acting equal and opposite.

578
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
Anybody who goes against collectivity,

579
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,440
who sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity

580
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,440
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga

581
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,080
and that's is to be remembered,

582
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,040
that to be collective is to be joyous,

583
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,680
is to be progressive, to be going further.

584
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,440
It was alright when people were meditating in the Himalayas.

585
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
It was alright at that time they were all alone,

586
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,640
meditating all alone,

587
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,560
to achieve something for the collective.

588
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,720
But they also did not get their Realization.

589
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,160
When you have got your Realization remember this.

590
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,000
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

591
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
into the Kingdom of Virat

592
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,240
where you are a part and parcel of a collective being.

593
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,120
You are not alone, you cannot be single out,

594
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,160
you cannot separate yourself.

595
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,120
Now you are awakened in the body of Virata

596
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
and you cannot get out of it.

597
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,400
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be nourished.

598
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,760
Supposing, I take out part of My body.

599
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,840
Will it be nourished by this body? It won't.

600
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,760
In the same way you have now become

601
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,240
part and parcel of that collectivity

602
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,560
and that collectivity that Virat is going to look after you,

603
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
going to nourish you,

604
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,240
going to do the everything that is necessary

605
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,040
for your spiritual, physical, mental, emotional,

606
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,480
even financial development.

607
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,440
But if you cut it short, if you

608
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,480
try to block the collectivity,

609
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,560
if you try to make problems for collectivity

610
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,240
or even if you try just to get out of the collectivity,

611
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,360
then that is not our interest, that is not our work.

612
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,760
This is to be understood fully,

613
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,160
in every way possible

614
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,280
and this when is understood in a proper way,

615
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,120
you should know that

616
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,880
collectivity is not only your advancement,

617
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,360
is not only your development,

618
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,120
is not only your achievements,

619
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,080
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

620
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,440
The purpose of your creation

621
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,040
is fulfilled by that.

622
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,840
Those people who live in the ashram

623
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,640
are better of always, than the people who live alone, always.

624
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,000
They will always have better results,

625
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,160
than the people who live alone.

626
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,640
Maybe they live alone

627
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,520
because they want to have a little private life or a privacy.

628
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,760
But their privacy is not going to help them.

629
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,880
That's not going to help them at all.

630
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,760
The more we live together,

631
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,560
the more you reside together,

632
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,000
the more you enjoy together,

633
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,520
there will be greater chances of your advancement.

634
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,520
The more you will try to make yourself private,

635
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,400
the more you'll try to get out of it,

636
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,880
whatever explanation you may give,

637
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,440
God understands, very well.

638
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,000
So all such things where you cut off yourself

639
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,680
from the mainstream,

640
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,600
you try to get out of the main stream,

641
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,360
then there is a big problem for you.

642
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,680
Of course, for certain conveniences you may,

643
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,160
for your certain understanding you may,

644
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,000
but you should enjoy more the company of Sahaja Yogis,

645
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,400
than your own private company

646
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,800
in the dingy room of yours.

647
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
That is one thing you can judge yourself.

648
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,080
Do you all enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis

649
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,600
or you enjoy the company

650
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,840
of three-four of your family people together in a circus.

651
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,400
Judgment is your own.

652
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,680
Yogi "A difficulty Shri Mataji".

653
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,840
Nothing is difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,400
It is the simplest thing to be a Sahaja Yogi.

655
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,800
And even more simple to be collective.

656
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,880
To be uncollective you have to do something.

657
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,440
Like I said that it is very easy not to drink.

658
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,160
Mean, I mean, drink some wines and things.

659
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,920
Because if you don't want to drink you are sitting at home,

660
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,440
it's alright, don't have to do anything.

661
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,960
But supposing you have to drink,

662
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
then you have to go a pub or you have to go somebody,

663
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,360
open the bottle, get a particular type of a glass,

664
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,640
pour it down, this, that.

665
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,840
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,

666
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,640
you are sitting with a fright.

667
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,840
But for a person who just drinks water he doesn't have to do it.

668
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,560
So to do wrong one has to do something.

669
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,880
But to be good you don't have to do much.

670
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,560
Is absolutely labor saving, energy saving process

671
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,080
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see,

672
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,920
I ah want to harm somebody,

673
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,760
I'll have to go out of the way to find out ways, methods.

674
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,720
If I to tell lies I have to think of ten lies to cover that one lie.

675
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,160
But if I tell the truth, finished,

676
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,480
I am still I've told the truth, finished, with few words it's done.

677
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,240
So to be collective is much more easier.

678
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,880
Of course, not for crooked people,

679
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,040
because crooked people whenever they move

680
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,560
their angularities trouble others.

681
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,560
You see, like ah ah poking ah of thorns.

682
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,520
But those who are flowers they fitting anywhere,

683
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,520
people like them.

684
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,800
They like their fragrance,

685
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,800
they look at them, they enjoy them beautiful things.

686
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,320
Now see, today they are looking like lotuses.

687
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,440
How is it? Without doing anything they have become lotuses.

688
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,320
How? How they have become like lotuses?

689
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,680
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies God only knows.

690
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,760
But they have become lotuses Sahaj.

691
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,480
How? Because they are one with God.

692
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,120
When we stand in our own way,

693
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,120
when we try to do something privately,

694
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,960
then God said, "Alright, go private'.

695
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,880
But when we are public He looks after us.

696
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,920
And then in Sahaj Yoga, as you know,

697
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,800
that collective growth

698
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,720
is the only way we understand Sahaj Yoga.

699
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,960
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something else,

700
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
somebody knows something else.

701
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,560
When we are collective,

702
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,880
then we really understand every aspect of Sahaj Yoga.

703
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,480
Supposing, there is somebody a scientist,

704
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,240
somebody is a musician,

705
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
somebody is another thing.

706
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,720
We cannot know everything.

707
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,480
So you know something from this one,

708
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,760
something from that one,

709
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,200
something from that.

710
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,560
So all the rivers has it's flowing into that collectivity

711
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,680
and you enjoy the ocean of these ah rivers.

712
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,920
You don't have to go to all the rivers in India,

713
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,040
like you go from Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Kaweri

714
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,400
you thousands of lives.

715
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,800
Go to the sea, all of them are there.

716
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,760
Like that you have to enjoy the sea where everything meets.

717
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,960
All kinds of beautiful things are there and you enjoy that.

718
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,480
I hope this Puja which is a very remarkable Puja.

719
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,800
Firstly so many things are Sahaj.

720
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,040
Firstly they told Me

721
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,960
the telephone number of this place is 32 16 32.

722
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,240
He, He's accompanied by 64 Yoginis, Shri Krishna.

723
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,080
So 32 on this side and 32 on that side and He sitting here

724
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,200
This place is called as Black ah Lake.

725
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,440
Krishna is black.

726
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,800
This place they got suddenly

727
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,120
and this is the only place in this

728
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,680
so-called military regime of Switzerland

729
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,240
where people can sleep on the ground.

730
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,440
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

731
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,080
If there's no cot you hang in the

732
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,360
air, but you cannot touch the ground.

733
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,480
That kind of the stupid military business is here.

734
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,720
Where to find such a sensible, practical,

735
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,760
such a cheap place for you is godsent.

736
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,520
We are here surrounded by beautiful things with the cows,

737
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,720
so many cows at the time when it is Krishna's birthday.

738
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,800
So many cows, so fond of cows

739
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,200
and the cows when they their bells

740
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,480
move in the morning I heard, in the evening so beautiful

741
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,320
and when they are moving home in the evening

742
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
how the as they call [SOUNDS LIKE -guraj] -

743
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,120
is the dust of their feet was filling the sky

744
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,840
is just Gokul here I felt.

745
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,680
Today also there's one thing more one has to say,

746
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,560
that is the sixteenth Shri Krishna Puja.

747
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,160
So in so many ways this is a very great Puja

748
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,040
which you are attending for which

749
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,840
people have to take thousands and thousands of janmas (births)

750
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,520
do so many punyas, which you have got so Sahaj,

751
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,400
because there must be something about you people also.

752
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,880
May God bless you.

753
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,600
Now, what are we decided?

754
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,880
Now they have got ah mantras

755
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,360
written in Sanskrit that

756
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,600
and 108 Names of Shri Krishna [NOT AUDIBLE] they got.

757
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,160
The one, one Rustam has done them in Sanskrit

758
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,080
and Gregoire has done them in.

759
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,360
I think everybody's hearing Me, aren't you?

760
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,960
And Gregoire has because you have to hear Me from Sahastrara,

761
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,360
you can.

762
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,320
And Gregoire has done in English language.

763
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,480
So we'll have

764
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,280
two types of Sanskrit and English words,

765
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,880
describing Shri Krishna's nature.

766
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,480
"Now today let the all the Sagittarius to [INAUDIBLE- My Puja?].

767
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,560

768
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,200
