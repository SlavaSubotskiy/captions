1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,260
it is very difficult to describe this

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:25,180
inner joy you can only enjoy it you can

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:32,619
only feel it something so you need to

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:37,090
see that so many of you have learnt this

5
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:47,170
difficult music and all of you have been

6
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:52,989
enjoying it I went to various places in

7
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:57,670
the West and I felt that why even small

8
00:00:52,989 --> 00:01:01,770
little children boys and girls take to

9
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,689
something which is self-destructive why

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,729
why do they take to drugs why do they

11
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,819
take to all these things which are

12
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:13,359
self-destructive I mean I could blame

13
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,889
the chip parents to some extent but on

14
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:20,759
the whole there was something within

15
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:24,429
them which was troubling them which was

16
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,020
trying to say that it's not true it's

17
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:30,279
not the thing it's not the thing that

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:33,240
you want and that's what made them go

19
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:36,399
into all kinds of various types of

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,659
rebellion I should say against all the

21
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:47,169
accepted truth or accepted goodness or

22
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:49,240
values and I just thought that of course

23
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:51,669
in India the parents are rather strict

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,149
ever say right but there's one more

25
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:59,950
thing in India there's a big outlet for

26
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:03,939
them and I found that outlet was the

27
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,149
talent that they had they had lots of

28
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,520
talents all of them I felt when I talked

29
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,370
to them and this and that I felt that

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,600
they have lots of talent but there is no

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,600
way to express it

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:26,860
people have been doing some sort of and

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:30,340
haphazard expression right and they

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,690
could not understand themselves why they

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,730
were doing and this was the main thing

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,360
that was lacking I think in the West

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:43,960
that the children had no way of

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,470
expressing themselves of expressing

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,800
their talent and this talent was making

40
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:57,160
them mad I think that was making them

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,860
absolutely rebellious it was not their

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,160
mistake by any chance it was an energy

43
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:09,190
within which was bubbling and had no

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:14,800
outlet and whatever outlet they had was

45
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:18,310
not recognised was not appreciated and

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,410
this made me feel that if these children

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,900
are given an outlet a means of

48
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,210
expressing themselves I am sure they'll

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,650
take to it they'll forget all these

50
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:35,890
things they'll never take to all

51
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:40,810
self-destructive ideas because they were

52
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:45,570
angry with them I think and it worked it

53
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:51,240
worked in the sense that first I wanted

54
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:55,750
you to start a school for small children

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,590
and I was surprised how this children

56
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:04,180
took to another kind of lifestyle very

57
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:08,260
discipline style and if they were very

58
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,300
different children like in the West I

59
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,070
found a child supposing you take him to

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:18,609
the shop he'll make you mad because it's

61
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:22,820
a find me this and buy me that not

62
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:25,790
understanding that one cannot afford it

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,360
and left to himself I would say that he

64
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:36,050
would go on dying with the whole of the

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,790
market so mad about it but I thought

66
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,230
that there was some sort of a thing

67
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:45,170
that's lacking in him in satisfied on

68
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:50,900
the contrary in India if you take one

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:55,460
boy or a girl to that market they'll say

70
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:58,010
Pass was only one one will do big very

71
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,340
big problem I add my own granddaughters

72
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:04,310
I took them once to Delhi because they

73
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,200
had broken their Chuck Paulson and they

74
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,080
had only one pair the parents have work

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,670
to do no problem but one cupful that

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,220
will get broken I said all right you

77
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:18,560
come along now in Delhi you can get good

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:21,530
ones we'll buy from so they came and I

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,290
bought for them they said nanny at any

80
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:28,820
cost will not take the second one we'll

81
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,970
just take one but I said supposing this

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,570
breaks and what we have then you will

83
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:38,000
come back again to Delhi to my chapel's

84
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:42,280
have one spare at least they won't

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,660
listen and they ran away into the car I

86
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,270
went there I said what are you doing why

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,000
don't you buy chapel's for yourself why

88
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:54,740
do you want to waste your money nanny

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,950
you can use it for something else now I

90
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,960
was surprised their way they were so

91
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,540
satisfied of course they are born

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,790
realized no doubt but also the whole

93
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:10,630
atmosphere I felt that this atmosphere

94
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:15,530
if the children from the West can get

95
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:18,440
they will definitely prosper they'll

96
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:22,970
definitely express themselves and

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:27,390
they'll become excellent people but I

98
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:32,820
know the energy was so much after

99
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:36,120
my brother your Baba mama I asked him

100
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,700
why not start an Academy of vision and

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:44,040
when they came to music I was surprised

102
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:46,680
I was really surprised when we had not

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,920
expected anything from them within three

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,650
months within four months they picked up

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,140
such a difficult music style it's

106
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,490
impossible it's impossible for Indians

107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,540
to do that they can never do in four

108
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,530
four months

109
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:12,260
oh wow I've seen in my own family there

110
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:16,500
were musicians and my sisters my brother

111
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:22,130
for hours together every morning is to

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,130
get about five o'clock and start them

113
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:30,690
every day we asked for 3-4 hours every

114
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,120
day I used to think now when will this

115
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,330
end I mean after all if somebody has to

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,950
sleep after 5:00 you better stand still

117
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,000
but that's a custom in India to get up

118
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,270
very early in the morning but the way

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,350
these people are learning it so fast it

120
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,650
is because that urge to express

121
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:58,260
themselves was inside very very strong

122
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:01,350
much stronger than Indians just I can

123
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:05,850
tell you very clearly I have never heard

124
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:09,150
of anybody learning this difficult music

125
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:13,200
in three months and four months four

126
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:16,200
years together they would not show same

127
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:22,410
about two people how you have started

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:25,200
appreciating it I just don't know I mean

129
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:33,270
it's a different atmosphere that has

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:35,460
started so full of hope and joy you see

131
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,990
now there was one fellow who went to

132
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:43,000
Belgium

133
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:45,220
he was a Italian Italian sahaja yogi he

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,850
said mother I was surprised there was a

135
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,130
nice program with the Indians and the

136
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,580
Indian consulate had arranged so I went

137
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,040
to the program and they were talking to

138
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,300
each other and some of them went out

139
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,520
some of them came in these Indians they

140
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,120
never understood that it was Balloon

141
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Rally when they do guten tag even an

142
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,100
ordinary pillow rock they cannot

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,779
recognize me I was surprised that this

144
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:21,730
Italian that he what he saying is really

145
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:26,430
I've seen the Indians when they go for

146
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:31,920
this kind of a very deep type of music

147
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,920
after 15 minutes they start slipping out

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:41,350
also they told me that in England they

149
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,100
went to a music centre or we can say for

150
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:49,570
the buying of the records or something

151
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,260
so all the boys who were there who were

152
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,410
Indians

153
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:58,209
we're buying pop music that music and

154
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,190
they looked at these sahaja Yogi's

155
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:05,170
decide you stupid fools why are you

156
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,690
buying this music this Indian music what

157
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,880
is there in this Indian music this said

158
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:15,339
is better not to talk to you because you

159
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:20,200
have gone now you see because some or

160
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:23,800
other this is a Sahaj trick I think that

161
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,760
your energies tuned up to a very circuit

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:31,000
and deep understanding of this otherwise

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,510
it would never have worked like I mean

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,920
it is the Kundalini of course no doubt

165
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:42,130
but their way she is nourished you to

166
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,839
absorb to understand to enjoy this is

167
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,839
very subtle music

168
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,829
and it has happened more with the

169
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:56,810
Western people than with the English I'm

170
00:10:51,829 --> 00:11:00,139
sorry but Indians don't have that much

171
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,740
of understanding not that much of in

172
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,970
German

173
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:09,379
Westerners may not injure may not

174
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:14,810
understand but they enjoy Indians field

175
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:19,029
those who are a little bit educated in

176
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:22,910
music will start finding out faults

177
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:27,500
finding out ragas this was not good that

178
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:32,930
no but not Western Western people are so

179
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:36,620
humble about it isn't it remarkable how

180
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:40,639
is it they have picked up so quickly and

181
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:43,339
ever understood because they have become

182
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,899
subtler this is the only thing I can say

183
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,839
they have become subtler

184
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:53,779
and their energies are flowing through

185
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:57,199
the subtler level surprising from Imam

186
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,769
also for me for everyone that in 3-4

187
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:04,399
months

188
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:09,500
how can you play Malcolm's Rock first

189
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:15,529
time I heard I how can that be

190
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:21,050
and that gives such a hope to save this

191
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:29,180
music it may be that in India it may be

192
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:32,750
declining but in the West its rising is

193
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,019
the other way now the Sun rises from the

194
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,930
east and sets on the west here is the

195
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:41,660
other way round now for music and I

196
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:48,500
would request all the Indians to develop

197
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:54,470
that subtle understanding see say if you

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,829
are a honeybee only then you can suck in

199
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,829
Donnie

200
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:07,700
the Flies cannot so you have to develop

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,339
that sensitivity I would say to Indians

202
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm sorry to say that you have to

203
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:19,000
develop that sensitivity with anything

204
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:23,290
which is possible through meditation and

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,290
through Kundalini awakening and

206
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:29,870
balancing and ultimately getting

207
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:34,130
connected with this all-pervading power

208
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:37,760
of Satan because sound is the second

209
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:42,589
state first was of course they said the

210
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:47,510
word but it was silent came into sound

211
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:54,529
and if you can understand the subtle of

212
00:13:47,510 --> 00:14:01,459
the sound within you if you can get one

213
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:05,170
with it it gives you that joy you will

214
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:11,899
be surprised I have never studied music

215
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:16,940
never you see I don't know why but

216
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:21,190
somehow I never study because I could

217
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,190
not have a guru this is the problem I

218
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,220
couldn't have a guru

219
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,339
so some or other I never studied music

220
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:37,930
but what I have is the same as you have

221
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:41,899
now is that subtle enjoyment sense of

222
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:45,560
music and that's why I say this is

223
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:48,410
divine of course I also enjoy some pop

224
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,810
you'll recall so enjoy western music

225
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,920
very much and the Western great composer

226
00:14:50,810 --> 00:15:01,690
side no doubt but this music has one

227
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,690
speciality that nothing is written down

228
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:11,610
there is no composure the musician is

229
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:16,860
the composer he is the player and he is

230
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:19,980
the book it's so individualistic if you

231
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:26,160
see that but today I was happy to see

232
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:28,860
all of them see this is the western side

233
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,339
of it that so many of them put together

234
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:40,529
we're singing see like a choir but not

235
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:42,660
so bad as that in the quiet you see

236
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:47,730
because I have attended many choirs also

237
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:50,460
it was too systematic to discipline this

238
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,580
is not here it is complete freedom

239
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,650
within themselves and the whole thing

240
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:59,550
worked out so well I mean it's such a

241
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,920
good combination of both the thing one

242
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:06,360
side is the music another side is the

243
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:11,490
collectivity so I have not said a word

244
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:15,860
about Baba's University or Academy but I

245
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,860
told him that I'm very proud of

246
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:32,610
he's very lovingly brought up this

247
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:38,480
Academy and has that character of our

248
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:46,079
old guru system which is very important

249
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:50,579
that keeps the whole place very holy as

250
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,589
you called power and that is working out

251
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,870
is working very hard I know Baba is

252
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:58,160
working very hard and all of you are

253
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:01,379
working very hard to help him but this

254
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,030
Academy will definitely I'm sure one day

255
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:07,530
we'll give that universal knowledge of

256
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:19,110
that subtle thing I am telling you about

257
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:23,850
I know it is late today

258
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:28,830
and tonight I should say but I'm used to

259
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:31,799
this more because you see in our when we

260
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:35,070
were young my father was so fond of

261
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,809
music and with position that so many

262
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,880
times we have slept at about five

263
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:39,679
o'clock in the morning so makes no

264
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,539
difference to me

265
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,240
same I find me new people that you are

266
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:48,179
the way you are enjoying so we have

267
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,919
great hope of saving our young people

268
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:59,419
who are going astray people who are

269
00:17:52,919 --> 00:18:03,750
frustrated people who are unhappy

270
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:08,580
because they have no satisfaction people

271
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:12,120
who are committing suicide in the

272
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,520
affluent countries also in our country

273
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,990
people who are becoming politicians I

274
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:22,590
think that's the worst thing that can

275
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:27,049
happen to it also we have people who are

276
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,049
doing all kinds of criminal things

277
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:36,430
bring all kinds of violence and

278
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:42,730
everything all that can be completely

279
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:46,120
covered with the ocean of music and if

280
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:50,890
it is done by sahaja Yogi's it would be

281
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:55,420
such a great emancipation for the whole

282
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:59,760
world which is absolutely do it is going

283
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:04,030
to work out so I am thankful to Bob mama

284
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:08,910
and to all others who are supporting him

285
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:13,590
in this and I hope you all will enjoy

286
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:16,450
this music on a very subtle level

287
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:22,410
because immediately with a mind which

288
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:27,870
reacts one start discussing arguing

289
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:32,400
condemning all that's not the way to

290
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:36,160
understand this music but just to enjoy

291
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,420
enjoyment he hasn't got two sides only

292
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:45,840
enjoyment signal and that should happen

293
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:51,930
to you all of you I am so much so much

294
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,930
overwhelmed really by this beautiful

295
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,940
renderings we have had for example now

296
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,610
we had from Oregon I mean I can't

297
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,790
believe that you know Rhonda Barr you

298
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:09,610
could have such beautiful dancing this

299
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:11,880
mr. Oren's a doctor who this name is

300
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,790
giving or Indaba

301
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,910
I don't know why it's called on the but

302
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:23,170
whatever it is it's such a horribly

303
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:29,590
phonetic man every day he used to kill

304
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:33,640
so many Hindus and thank God he was a

305
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:36,670
thin man he was wait in there thread

306
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,250
Jenna you thread how many were healed

307
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:43,060
you know imagine what a great man he was

308
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:45,730
and under his name is this or Inaba if

309
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,530
you have to change any name in this

310
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:54,610
country it should be or ins a man around

311
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:57,010
about Annie he had no sense of music he

312
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,250
never used to listen to music you know

313
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:04,060
but he was extremely honest that's

314
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:07,420
another point about honesty and he would

315
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:14,230
not take any money for his survival from

316
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:18,460
the state is to stitch toe piece and

317
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:21,220
sell them then imagine if you had not

318
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,720
done that and had been a little bit

319
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,230
loving person would have been much

320
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,230
better but from that around abbath comes

321
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:33,550
this music and gamble I was amazed I

322
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:36,070
thought how can it be how did they call

323
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:43,330
it or Anka bod I don't know but he's the

324
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:47,310
one who hated music how these people be

325
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:50,760
born there and what dancing they show

326
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:53,590
also you have seen the Kuchipudi from

327
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:59,070
Baba's Institute was another one of us

328
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:02,320
just I hope right these are girls from

329
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:05,680
absolutely from countries where they

330
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,740
have never known always and in such a

331
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,730
short time to learn such a dance like

332
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:15,990
Kuchipudi is the most difficult done

333
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,190
very fast my goodness I thought that

334
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,180
what has happened to them

335
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:27,340
oh you may say mother this is due to

336
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:29,680
surge whatever it is but sahaja also is

337
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,590
to be borne by you people

338
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,330
now if you have a very small little

339
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:38,140
candle how much it can burn but these

340
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:43,990
are

341
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:47,020
like the ocean of energies and the way

342
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:50,320
they are expressing themselves is

343
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:54,400
remarkable of course I love you very

344
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:57,070
much and it is not out of that love and

345
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,610
admiration I am saying this but it's a

346
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:04,030
fact

347
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:12,030
is a reality I I had no idea that one

348
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:12,030
day a will go that and this global

349
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:21,160
movement is going to work out wonders

350
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:24,310
you must spread also the music along

351
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:35,080
with the vibrations I am sure it would

352
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:38,500
be really or definite I can't believe I

353
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,750
asked Baha is how how is it is there

354
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:47,800
only four months time everybody four

355
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:51,820
months very remarkable then we have one

356
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,480
from Spain I saw him playing Spanish but

357
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:58,720
Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

358
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,180
because it goes hectic you know it is

359
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,780
very fast sometimes very slow but it's

360
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:09,340
very rhythmic but is hectic ours is very

361
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:13,540
much I should say discipline whatever it

362
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:18,430
is he also is played so well so there

363
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:21,910
are so many examples to show that you

364
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:23,740
may be from the western country it's

365
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:30,760
better to be from the western country

366
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:33,370
now for music and from this I can't

367
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,940
understand why they say it's a miracle

368
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,620
but why should this miracle work in the

369
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:43,540
West and not in India I don't understand

370
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,340
though I am sure the Indians are

371
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,740
enjoying this music no doubt because

372
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,040
they are all sahaja Yogi's but you go to

373
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,230
any program

374
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,140
any other program where there are very

375
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:59,940
few sahaja Yogi's you see that the way

376
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,160
they behave without any discipline the

377
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,600
respect that is paid in India to the

378
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:11,370
musicians has to be of a very high level

379
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:15,030
or any talent say even art see also

380
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:18,630
people who make beautiful things from

381
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:22,050
their hands all these people who are so

382
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,690
talented are to be respected very much

383
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:28,860
because it's a special gift God has

384
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:32,930
given now in India we have got a very

385
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:39,870
big problem also all great artists but

386
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:46,080
in - there should say into the influence

387
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:52,310
of the West and so many of them take

388
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:58,530
scotch whisky or dizzy - that so many

389
00:25:52,310 --> 00:26:00,810
and their music is finished you can't

390
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:06,030
even play cricket with Scotch whisky

391
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:09,420
live alone music and this Western

392
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:14,420
influence of taking drinks and things

393
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,650
like that has rained our musicians I

394
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,410
don't know what's going to happen I was

395
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,780
quite worried that how is it going to be

396
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:25,080
retained in this country but now I have

397
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:28,410
great hopes because if they see the

398
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:33,240
Western people doing so well see four

399
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:37,700
against this goes into their heads that

400
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:42,350
how can they do it oh that was very much

401
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:47,880
where you can see Western people doing

402
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:51,510
such good music it's very influential so

403
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,100
instead of having any Indian artist on

404
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:58,500
the stage we should really bring foreign

405
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:04,679
it will have a great effect I tell you

406
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:07,080
on English now it was very shameful the

407
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:10,799
way sometimes Indians behave in a

408
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:15,210
classical music programs very simple for

409
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:18,150
anybody they have no sense nothing and

410
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:22,500
they go on misbehaving they come there

411
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:29,039
for social social affair I think that's

412
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:34,020
all on this point the Indians as sahaja

413
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:39,049
Yogi's are to be responsible and to see

414
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:46,260
for yourself how much they have achieved

415
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:49,980
how much they have understood somebody

416
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:52,890
who saw them said mother now even in

417
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:59,429
Indian music if they go ahead of us what

418
00:27:52,890 --> 00:28:02,700
will happen to us but still we have very

419
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:12,150
great musicians as you have our own apt

420
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:15,080
a before you I must tell you we had a

421
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:19,590
program in Pune

422
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,080
that's called a shearing and I was very

423
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,360
tired and so I told yogi what's the

424
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,809
program next one he said some musician

425
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:32,370
has come he wanted to sing so he has

426
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:34,710
come I said which musician I don't know

427
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,730
his name but you see yogi I think was

428
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:41,820
that time not so much music landed

429
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:45,990
typical Indians time so what are you go

430
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:49,559
and sleep so I'd lay down and I heard

431
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:53,909
his voice and I'm hurting I said who's

432
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:58,500
just seeking I came back I to change my

433
00:28:53,909 --> 00:29:03,080
sari I asked you who is he they told me

434
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,320
the name I said she's a great seeker

435
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,740
what do you understand

436
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,290
how much are you going to pay he told me

437
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:19,690
such a meager thing I said are you mad

438
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:22,960
you'll be then I went out and I heard

439
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,100
this great music I heard his guru also

440
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,290
before who was also very great that time

441
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:33,580
and also got it characterized a guru

442
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:36,280
bandhu both of them but I was surprised

443
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,900
that none of the Indians could

444
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:44,020
understand him what he was saying this

445
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:49,720
Maharashtra is known for music for

446
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:53,590
classical music but surprisingly it's

447
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:58,510
not that level now that we had seen I am

448
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:02,830
happy to see this resurrection of Indian

449
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:08,730
music through you people that was one of

450
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:15,070
my greatest desire to get the art

451
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:17,890
handicrafts and music all kinds of

452
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:22,600
things which are created through this

453
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:31,240
talent should prosper and I am very

454
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:36,309
happy to see that despite so late you

455
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:40,750
all are still alert and enjoying I can't

456
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:43,500
say about other artists who have very

457
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,610
much impressed you and impressed me so

458
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:50,380

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:56,830
