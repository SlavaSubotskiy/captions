1
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,500
Sahaja yogis should not fall to such a level

2
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:04,375
of mundane type of people after all what is going to happen to you

3
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:08,792
I would say those who have been worrying and all that,

4
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,291
should go into great meditation and understand

5
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:15,208
that you are insulting yourself. You are saints;

6
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,458
why should you worry about what plane you are going to get,

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,583
what you are not going to get? Shows that your level is very low;

8
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,041
definitely; all those who have worried.

9
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:30,583
You have come here under My protection,

10
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:41,291
and you will go back under My protection.

11
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,208
we’ll not have any pujas. You must know

12
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:49,875
that you are all part and parcel of My being;

13
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:58,125
I have put you in My body and you have to behave yourself.

14
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:08,041
so in such an auspicious day when we all have come here

15
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:16,792
to do this special puja, and I would say this should be called

16
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:21,709
as a Mahalakshmi Puja because it’s something to do

17
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,625
with the industry of this country, and of the whole world.

18
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:35,667
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

19
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,500
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

20
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:45,291
That’s why we have problems now in the West.

21
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,417
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

22
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:53,333
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions

23
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,375
and things because they have no balance.

24
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:01,834
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

25
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:06,166
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:17,834
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

27
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:23,166
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:30,709
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

29
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,625
and for helping others, with a balance,

30
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:43,291
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

31
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,750
all this She has produced before.

32
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,542
She can produce for people who are sensible,

33
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:58,250
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

34
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:09,750
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

35
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,291
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

36
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:21,792
And that is how an industry can grow.

37
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:25,291
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

38
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:30,333
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

39
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:36,500
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

40
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,667
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

41
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:48,875
So a balance has to be drawn.

42
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,792
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

43
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:59,542
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

44
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,250
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

45
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,875
about which the Indians are not aware.

46
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:09,583
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

47
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:17,792
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

48
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:24,792
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

49
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:28,542
because otherwise who will look after them?

50
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,500
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

51
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:37,875
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

52
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,792
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

53
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:51,750
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

54
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:59,250
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

55
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:06,250
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

56
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,667
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

57
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:16,208
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

58
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,083
They have tried something like that.

59
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:25,458
But industry should not be looked down upon

60
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,917
as it is looked down upon in our country.

61
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,500
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

62
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:35,750
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

63
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,500
It should be treated with respect,

64
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,667
and should be understood that it’s very important.

65
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,250
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

66
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,625
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

67
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,500
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

68
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,458
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,750
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

70
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:10,583
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

71
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:16,041
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

72
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:22,500
who are under the protection, or under the service,

73
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,333
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

74
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,417
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

75
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,208
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

76
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,709
to be the worst people, which is not so.

77
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,000
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

78
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,333
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

79
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,500
of very poor people how they behaved

80
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:49,166
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

81
00:07:49,208 --> 00:08:00,166
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

82
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:05,667
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

83
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:13,667
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

84
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:20,417
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit

85
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,875
will become very important.

86
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,999
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

87
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:30,583
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

88
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:35,792
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon

89
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:42,291
for everyone. But still we are struggling

90
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:49,208
to be on that state; many are; and still we go into materialistic tantrums

91
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:55,250
or some sort of a stupid worrying fall.

92
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,834
All these must be carefully watched.

93
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:06,041
If you can keep this chariot of new progress

94
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,458
progressing faster

95
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,709
we are going to create a new world of complete harmony,

96
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,917
complete peace, joy and love. But for that

97
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:24,125
you are the ones who have to do it. I cannot do it.

98
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,458
If I could have done it

99
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,375
I would not have asked you to join Sahaja Yoga.

100
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,250
It’s like the horses and the charioteer;

101
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:38,125
horses are to be driven; charioteer doesn’t drive the chariot.

102
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:42,583
In the same way you must understand your responsibility

103
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,291
that this is the greatest work we are doing.

104
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:54,083
It’s not only the industry, or the labor and the capital,

105
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,542
I’m talking about, but I’m talking about the totality of well being.

106
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:03,709
Of course all of this is a part and parcel of that, no doubt.

107
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,500
But the balance should be with the totality.

108
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:12,250
So we have to think of a total well being.

109
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,542
Once we start thinking of the total well being then –

110
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,208
first thing that should come to us:

111
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:23,125
Are we capable of bringing up that total well being? Are we?

112
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:29,166
Have we got the total well being within ourselves or not? Have we?

113
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,834
We are still worried if the plane is coming or not,

114
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,999
I mean, we are so mundane, so little, so small.

115
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:44,041
With one bandhan you can control any plane, any atmosphere,

116
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,125
and here you are, I mean, still worried about things

117
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,041
which are absolutely under your control.

118
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,250
So this totality has to be thought over.

119
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,625
What is this totality that Mother is talking about?

120
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:07,834
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

121
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:21,750
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

122
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:25,291
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

123
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:33,208
So for that, what She does is to give  Avaida

124
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,959
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

125
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,000
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

126
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:49,041
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

127
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,500
because everything is mythical for you.

128
00:11:52,542 --> 00:12:02,709
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

129
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,667
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

130
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:15,125
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

131
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,750
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

132
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:22,250
and panicked, because they panic others

133
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,542
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

134
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:29,999
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

135
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,667
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

136
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,750
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

137
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,375
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

138
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:46,709
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

139
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,750
they are the same English who ruled us here.

140
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,375
And we were so bewitched before them and now

141
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,667
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

142
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,041
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

143
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,250
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

144
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,583
that the other person will dominate him.

145
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,375
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

146
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,583
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

147
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,875
out of this mythical fear.

148
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:19,917
The fear is created by our ego.

149
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:26,083
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

150
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,583
because he has not harmed anyone.

151
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,583
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

152
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,542
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

153
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:40,458
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

154
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,458
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

155
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,709
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

156
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:55,792
That’s what it is. So when I talk of total benevolence

157
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:01,083
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

158
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,000
So first is the fear,

159
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,333
which should go out of your mind completely

160
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,834
if you believe in the Almighty God. We’ll say,

161
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,542
“You are Almighty God, you are almighty this thing”

162
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:17,166
It's all lip-service. If you believe that God is almighty,

163
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,959
and you are connected with God,

164
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,834
then why should you have any fear of anything?

165
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:26,792
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

166
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,792
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

167
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:35,000
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

168
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,125
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

169
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:45,750
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

170
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:52,417
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

171
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:58,750
But you think you are God. You are not.

172
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,792
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

173
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,667
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

174
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,208
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,

175
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,917
for yourself, and for everybody else.

176
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:21,500
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

177
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:26,959
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

178
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,583
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

179
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:36,542
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

180
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,500
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

181
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,375
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

182
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:50,667
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

183
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,291
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

184
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:59,917
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

185
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:04,250
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

186
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,375
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

187
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:13,417
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything

188
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,667
that I am telling you. Only I can tell you. Who else?

189
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,250
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

190
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.

191
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:29,041
This is another style of reaction one gets,

192
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,625
means they are not interested in their own benevolence,

193
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,999
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their children,

194
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:39,375
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their country or the whole world.

195
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,250
Now why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? Just ask one question.

196
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,625
Of course for you to ascend. But ascend for what?

197
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,417
Supposing we bring one tube light.

198
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:55,625
For what we have to take the tube light? But for what?

199
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:59,041
We have to put the light. But this tube light doesn’t give light,

200
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,458
nothing of the kind, so what’s the use of having this tube light?

201
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,166
In the same way, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga

202
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:14,250
if you cannot become the light of the Divine?

203
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:24,500
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

204
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,709
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

205
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,542
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

206
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,125
you are no good. All of you can come up,

207
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:39,417
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

208
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:47,125
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

209
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:52,875
Then the attention is very important.

210
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:57,333
The attention should be on your own perfection

211
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:03,917
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

212
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,500
that they start finding faults with others

213
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,125
instead of finding faults with themselves.

214
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:15,834
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

215
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:21,417
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

216
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,959
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

217
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:31,667
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

218
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,166
you have every right, you have every control,

219
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:42,834
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

220
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,999
is to find faults with others.

221
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,417
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

222
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:55,375
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

223
00:18:55,417 --> 00:19:02,333
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

224
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,291
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

225
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:10,750
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

226
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,250
They see somebody doing like this,

227
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,208
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

228
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,417
so what’s the harm if I do?”

229
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,667
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

230
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:24,625
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

231
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:31,417
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

232
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,917
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

233
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,792
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

234
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,792
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

235
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,417
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

236
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:49,417
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

237
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,500
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

238
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:58,750
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

239
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:04,208
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

240
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,041
will get their realization to begin with, never.

241
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:13,834
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

242
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:19,166
but I never expected. But it has happened,

243
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:24,875
and even now I have to expect that all of you

244
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:29,750
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

245
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,166
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

246
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,333
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

247
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,166
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

248
00:20:41,208 --> 00:21:09,999
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

249
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,208
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

250
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,291
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

251
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:03,583
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

252
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:08,041
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

253
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,834
he just went and stood before him stunned.

254
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:20,041
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

255
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:25,041
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

256
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,750
This is the appreciation one should have,

257
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,792
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

258
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:34,750
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

259
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:40,208
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

260
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,792
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

261
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:53,291
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

262
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,875
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

263
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:00,999
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

264
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,999
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

265
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:09,500
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

266
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:13,333
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

267
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:18,166
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

268
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:23,291
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

269
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:28,333
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

270
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,834
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

271
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:37,333
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

272
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,750
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

273
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,917
that this has come from our country;

274
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:46,333
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

275
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:49,917
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

276
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:56,041
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

277
00:33:56,083 --> 00:34:00,875
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

278
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,999
We have reached that state where we are all one.

279
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,458
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

280
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,291
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

281
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:21,208
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

282
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:27,375
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

283
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:33,000
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

284
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:38,291
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

285
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,834
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

286
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,917
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

287
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:49,834
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

288
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:55,000
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

289
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,999
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

290
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:01,875
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

291
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:08,166
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

292
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:14,250
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

293
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:19,667
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

294
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:26,667
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

295
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,041
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

296
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,875
that this is this; nothing; we love them

297
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:38,875
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

298
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:43,667
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

299
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,041
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

300
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,917
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

301
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:56,792
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

302
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:01,000
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

303
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:09,083
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

304
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:14,250
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

305
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:22,000
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

306
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,917
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

307
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:32,999
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

308
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,291
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

309
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,709
not only that, but he told him that,

310
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,458
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

311
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,041
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

312
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:52,166
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

313
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:57,875
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

314
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:01,917
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

315
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:07,542
What can you do? So at that time,

316
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:10,709
if these saints could love each other,

317
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:16,375
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

318
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,792
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

319
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:23,834
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

320
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:28,959
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

321
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,500
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

322
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:37,375
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

323
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:40,542
and this is what we are going to know;

324
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:45,500
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

325
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:51,125
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

326
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:55,917
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

327
00:37:55,959 --> 00:38:03,792
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

328
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:11,542
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

329
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:15,208
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

330
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,375
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

331
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,667
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

332
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,959
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

333
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,625
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

334
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,041
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

335
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,667
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

336
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,834
to hang themselves for a time being.

337
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:38,125
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

338
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:47,709
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

339
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,333
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

340
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:57,458
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

341
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:04,625
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

342
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:11,166
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

343
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:16,999
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

344
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:19,917
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

345
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,375
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

346
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:26,750
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

347
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,500
What does it matter? Why is it so important

348
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:36,417
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

349
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,291
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

350
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:43,083
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

351
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,959
so why worry?

352
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:50,750
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

353
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,291
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

354
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,917
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

355
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,917
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

356
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:03,375
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

357
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:09,041
then again I forget. So you are,

358
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:12,792
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

359
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:18,667
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

360
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,458
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

361
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:27,625
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

362
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:31,999
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

363
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:35,500
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

364
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,959
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

365
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,083
but still they go on doing like this.

366
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,375
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

367
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:47,834
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

368
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:52,500
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

369
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:57,125
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

370
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:03,208
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

371
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,208
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

372
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:11,375
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

373
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,917
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

374
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,125
So it is important, it’s a drama.

375
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:24,917
The worry should be one:

376
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:32,542
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

377
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:39,750
I tell you only this universal love will give you

378
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:45,041
that confidence and that higher status.

379
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,750
Why these saints suffered for you?

380
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,125
Why did Christ suffer for you?

381
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,750
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

382
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:56,166
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

383
00:41:56,208 --> 00:42:01,125
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

384
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,250
What did they get?

385
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:10,500
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

386
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:14,959
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

387
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,208
whatever they have done, it’s just

388
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:21,250
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

389
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,959
Why not you do it?

390
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,999
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

391
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,667
to be all the time burning, then please

392
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:35,792
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

393
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,542
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

394
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:41,417
May God bless you.
