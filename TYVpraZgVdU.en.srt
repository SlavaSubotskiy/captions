1
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Very happy to be back here in Melbourne, after
such a long gap, and everybody's grown up

2
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:16,149
so much; nice to see you all so healthy, beautiful
and joyous. Of course I feel sad about the

3
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:44,079
ashram that 
we have lost, that we should not have lost
the ashram. But whatever has happened you

4
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:41,130
can't help it; but it's important for Sahaja
Yoga that we have to live together. I also

5
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,320
told the same thing in Perth, that try to
get a big place, because you know your children

6
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,780
are there, and you all are there, and if you
are together, negativity runs away. It has

7
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
such a tremendous force, an ashram has a tremendous
force. When you live together, you help each

8
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:58,490
other, you understand each other, you know
so many things, you learn so many things from

9
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,600
each other and, it could be done very easily,
once you start enjoying the collectivity.

10
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:37,379
Human being is a social being. He is not a
person who wants to live in a -- single way.

11
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:47,100
That's why if you jail someone, if somebody's
in jail, it becomes a punishment. Though in

12
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:54,840
the jail you have all the conveniences, everything
is there, on the contrary you don't have to

13
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,840
work so hard, you get your food all right,
everything is fine, somebody cooks for you.

14
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:13,929
But it's a punishment.
And for our ascent is very important to be

15
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,990
collective. It's said that wherever you are
together I reside there[with you?]. But human

16
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,909
nature is funny. In some places collectivity
has acted very well, like in Austria and we

17
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:53,909
have the best ashram in Austria. Now they
have about five, six ashrams there, one better

18
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:01,179
than the other. In itself in Vienna we have
I think four ashrams, and it's growing so

19
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:08,659
well. Nobody wants to live alone, so anxious
to join, come back to ashrams; and so many

20
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,210
problems are solved otherwise also on very
material level. Everything gets shared, you

21
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:23,210
don't have to pay too much money. Now if you
are living alone, then sometimes you feel

22
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,399
like spending your money here, there and at
the end of the day no money is left out. But

23
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:38,840
in the ashram you know how much to pay.
Then there are some people who want to buy

24
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,840
-- I mean on a material level -- something
very exorbitant, something great and this

25
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:53,409
and that, and nobody to control that, that
desire that need. As a result, we become extravagant,

26
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:08,020
so much so that you are left with nothing.
Exactly this happened in Perth. I know of

27
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:14,860
people who had money, and when they took their
houses and they're living there, they have

28
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,860
no money at all. I said, 'Why?' He said, 'For
food we spend so much and then need to go

29
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:31,129
and get this and do this,' and the whole day
they are busy working it out -- on individual

30
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,850
basis. There's no time for meditation. There's
no time for listening to My tapes, no time

31
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:44,850
for anything. And everybody has gone down
so much in vibrations there that I was really

32
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:52,760
shocked. Perth was one of the places I felt
was a very good place. It's so open and so

33
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,760
clean and so nice; and what are you doing
-- going out shopping, buying this cloth,

34
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:07,240
that cloth, this dress, that dress and piles
in the house, because that fashion was the

35
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,220
other day.
In Sahaja Yoga there's a Sahaja fashion. We

36
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:19,220
don't change our dresses every day in Sahaja
Yoga. Every year we buy whatever is needed.

37
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,290
That's all. And Australia specially, being
such an expensive place, I mean, I think this

38
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:30,240
is one of the most expensive nations I've
seen -- the most expensive. First I used to

39
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,960
think Helsinki, Finland is the most expensive
but now I've gone just to buy these shoes,

40
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,960
I've walked for hours together to get the
pair of shoes here. In India you can get it

41
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,050
in no time and I've paid at least three times
more that I would pay, even in London and

42
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,839
at least four times more that I would pay
in Italy. In India I need not tell, you know

43
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,710
that very well.
So if you -see it's a kind of a time that

44
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:07,710
you have that if you start doing this, doing
that. And the essence of all that is what?

45
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:16,490
Is to please others. We buy good clothes to
please others; want to have nice curios to

46
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:23,609
please others; want to decorate our house
to please others; we don't do it for ourselves,

47
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,320
do we? So then there is not the other -- like
we were staying in London and there were seven

48
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:39,639
houses, and everybody was busy you see, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, doing all the lawns, everything

49
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:48,300
and polishing all the brass and everything
in those houses. But not even a rat would

50
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,629
enter that house. I said, 'For whom are they
doing it? I don't know'. Poor things, they

51
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:59,629
are working so hard, nobody to see it. And
that's how they become extremely depressed

52
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:08,899
and unhappy.
This depression you don't find among Indians

53
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:10,770
at all because their houses are open, anybody
can walk in, have food, walk out. You will

54
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,770
not know whose house, to whom it belongs.
Then this depression walks in. Is a psychological

55
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:28,060
thing, because human beings are social beings.
You must understand the essence of [INAUDIBLE].

56
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:35,000
You can never be happy living alone. And this
aloofness and this individualism has brought

57
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
this kind of a new thing which we call as
tensions and as depressions and then go to

58
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,169
schizophrenia. There's not a single case of
schizophrenia I have seen in India -- not

59
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:56,169
a single case. Ah some people become lunatics
but lunatics are there and they are put in

60
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,730
the jail. There are very few lunatics.
Now, in England the lunatics are so many,

61
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,839
and so many schizophrenics that they have
said: "Now we'll not have any more, let them

62
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:10,149
be with the society. If they live with the
society they'll be all right". So now they

63
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:15,070
are starting a society of people who would
like to stay with lunatics and the lunatics

64
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,579
have improved, living with society. Even here
they will start after some time, that allow

65
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:27,579
the lunatics to live with the people. Talk
to them nicely. Because, how do we live? With

66
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,970
love, with rapport. We can't live alone. That's
a little bit of a, idea we have that, 'This

67
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:46,820
is my house, this is my this thing, this is
my...' But you rise above a little bit and

68
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:55,839
then you'll say, 'It's so nice to decorate
the ashram, it's for everyone.' Do good to

69
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,790
others, so everybody says, 'What a nice thing
it is'. Now see such a nice house [man's name?]

70
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,690
has got. If he had not come you would not
have seen it. She would have worked so hard,

71
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:15,270
poor thing, nobody would have appreciated
it.

72
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:22,190
And this idea of 'my-ness' and 'I-ness' has
to be given up in Sahaja Yoga, then you will

73
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,560
know what is joy is; and then you will write
to Me, 'Mother, we are all swimming in the

74
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,060
Ocean of Joy'. Matter is just -- you know
you'll be surprised -- matter is only for

75
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:38,589
expression of love and for nothing else. They
all call Me very generous but you don't know

76
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:45,589
I am very selfish because I enjoy Myself by
giving it to others, that's the greatest enjoyment

77
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,129
for Me. But this time I had gathered so many
things for you, and they told Me, 'Don't bring

78
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:59,129
anything to Australia'. Look at this country
-- funny one -- they don't allow any presents

79
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:05,169
to be brought here for people whom I want
to give and enjoy My generosity.

80
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:11,190
So that is what it is that when we understand
the essence, now we are on the essence because

81
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:18,190
we are on the Kundalini. Then we must know
the essence of joy. And the joy is in sharing.

82
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:28,940
But here people share which should not be
shared, their privacy. Where they have to

83
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,940
be private they are not. Just the other way
round. I shouldn't say that but is a fact

84
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,940
you know it for definite. You see even Mrs.
Thatcher said that, 'It's our culture that

85
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,139
women must expose their body.' Can you imagine
Mrs. Thatcher saying that? But I heard with

86
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:54,139
My Own ears. So whatever is to be shared is
not shared, whatever is not to be shared is

87
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:02,440
shared, and if you say, 'Why are you sharing?'
'You are jealous, you are very small-minded,

88
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,440
you are very narrow-minded, you are very selfish'.
As Sahaja Yogis you can see it because you

89
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,770
have the witness power, you can see it clearly.
You have that Divine eyesight, you can see

90
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:23,770
that clearly, that this is this thing, just
the opposite. Of course you don't have to

91
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:35,839
take sannyasa. You don't have to do all these
stupid things, but you have to enjoy the collectivity.

92
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,000
This is the culture of Sahaja Yoga. And now
if you people cannot live together, how do

93
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I expect the whole world to live together?
Of course there are problems, because of our

94
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,570
ideas, not because there's something wrong
with collectivity. I told them this morning

95
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:03,570
the same thing I would like to tell you: that
the first thing is when we start looking at

96
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,170
others we try to gather the thorns, 'What's
wrong with that another person,' instead of

97
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:16,170
gathering the flowers. If you want to gather
the thorns, all right, go ahead. I mean how

98
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:22,320
can you get flowers then? As simple as that.
It's a very simple mathematics. But if you

99
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,230
want to have flowers you should see to the
beauty of another person, glory of another

100
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:34,130
person, the better side of it. And those who
cannot see it, can never enjoy another person.

101
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:41,130
And the Sahaja Yogis can enjoy each other
very well. It's so sweet it is and so beautiful

102
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,020
that you all can live together like that.
I wish I could, all the time, with you all.

103
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:53,020
But it's not in My Fate I have to travel from
one place to another. I left them there. I

104
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:04,040
was so much wrenched in My Heart really and
I was so heavy that I just closed My eyes

105
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,930
trying to get over it; and there I find all
the flowers smiling at Me at the airport and

106
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:15,720
whole thing finished. Neutralized. I said,
'Now these were also waiting. After all I

107
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:22,720
have to come for them, here.'
So you see this love, this affection, this

108
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,579
deeper understanding that we have, within
ourselves, that we are in love with each other,

109
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:37,579
where can we express? In a house which is
separate, the housewife is busy with the household,

110
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:43,940
man is busy with another thing. But doing
it together is such a beauty, and that's what

111
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,460
has happened to Australia today. As it is
Australia is such a cut-off place, from the

112
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,460
whole world, is more necessary that you should
ask for collectivity here. Even to come, even

113
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:04,190
from Perth to here took three hours for us;
such a vast country so separated from each

114
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:11,190
other. When you are separated you come closer
to each other, very much more. Try to understand

115
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,160
your essence and I think now your attitudes
will change and next time I should come to

116
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,950
an ashram here. That's what I want. All of
you if you work it out you can do it. After

117
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,950
all there is paramachaitanya working on it.
But is a common case with people that they

118
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:39,030
don't want to live collectively. It's very
common case. But those who enjoy, you see,

119
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:46,030
their Spirit cannot enjoy life without living
together. Because Spirit is the collective

120
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:53,589
being. It is a collective being. It's nature
it is a collective being. That's the trouble.

121
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,599
So you can't be in the water as well as in
the boat. And either you have to be spiritually

122
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:12,530
inclined, or you should be in the Spirit or
in the body. And for your ascent is very important.

123
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:22,130
We have to establish very good ashrams, where
you can also have a center down below or something.

124
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:28,900
All of you put together can manage that, I
know that very well. If it is decided you

125
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,380
can do it. If you need any help I am willing
to help you. This Kew thing, I don't know

126
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,579
why it fizzled out. The man became very greedy
or whatever it is. But this was a very beautiful

127
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:45,579
place, I enjoyed it very much thoroughly there.
Also sometimes it happens that somebody becomes

128
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,780
despotic, somebody becomes dictatorial, some
things happen like that, but it will pass

129
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,420
out. But once you break away, it will be difficult
for you to come together. You'll find excuses,

130
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,329
'I have got this work', the another will say,
'I have that job', 'I have to do this'. Everything

131
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:07,910
can be done collectively much better. Just
now see I was talking to him, one minute,

132
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,740
before, but I didn't know what he was doing.
I said, 'What do you do?' He said, 'Government

133
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:18,740
service,' 'What kind?' He said, 'Immigration.'
I said, 'That's it. I wanted you.' Not for

134
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:24,290
My immigration, but for John Watkinson, and
he's worrying Me too much because poor fellow,

135
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:30,000
John Watkinson, you know; you know John Watkinson
very well -- how beautifully he works out

136
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,619
everything, you know that very well. And he's
in trouble. He can't get his wife in England.

137
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:40,640
So I want him to immigrate here. I was talking
to him and he gave Me very good idea. Supposing

138
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,640
we were not together, I would not have done
anything. Immediately you see, as soon as

139
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:54,440
a problem comes up, they say, 'All right,
so this place, there is someone like that,

140
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,930
Mother can we take her?'
All over the world we have people. It's like

141
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:06,890
one big body. And as soon as there's problem
with the eyes, some hand is there to help

142
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,880
us. That's how we are going to work it out.
Do you understand the importance of Sahaja

143
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Yoga, at this juncture? It's not 'by the way',
it's very important, extremely important thing.

144
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:29,770
I don't know if you really know about it.
Such work was never done in the history of

145
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:35,609
Spirituality, in the history of this world,
or universe whatsoever. And this kind of a

146
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:40,810
masse transformation that is taking place,
which is going to transform the whole world.

147
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:46,250
But just the opposite of us are Russians.
Russians are tremendous people.

148
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:53,250
Now we have a house, big, huge house, in Russia.
I've been there only twice, once for eight

149
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:02,430
days, another time for two days, and they
are so dynamic and so spiritually evolved,

150
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,000
I cannot describe to you, when I went there
in Leningrad, there were two thousand people

151
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,500
inside the hall, and two thousand sitting
outside, and I didn't know what to do with

152
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:21,069
them. After all lecture, program -- it lasted
for two hours or so, two and a half hours,

153
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:28,069
when I came out all two thousand were still
outside waiting. It touched My Heart really.

154
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,650
Said: 'But Mother what about us?' I said:
'All right, tomorrow you come along here outside

155
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:38,490
I'll see you, all of you, I must meet you
tomorrow.' So the two thousand who were inside

156
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,069
and the two thousand who were outside -- all
were there on the grounds and all of them

157
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:48,650
are there now in Sahaja Yoga. The follow-up
we had to take in the same hall.

158
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:55,650
Now they've found a house for us, anything
you want. Even their ministers. They gave

159
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,490
us an independent chart. There's no organization
from outside Russia has got an independent

160
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:09,349
chart. We can do what we like. They are willing
to pay for My ticket, for the ticket who comes

161
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:16,349
with Me and they are going to pay for My hotels
and they are going to do everything. Tremendous

162
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,900
personality and they might one day become
the greatest Spiritual people -- the way they

163
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:32,480
are. But they had to learn collectivity through
their training of communism, that has come

164
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,890
handy. Though there are many defects of communism
no doubt, but the greatest advantage they

165
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:44,270
had is the collectivity; to know to share.
And that's why it has worked. I've been thinking

166
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,550
"Why is it so much?" Of course they have no
conditioning of religions and things, they

167
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:55,440
all divide us, religions this that. But there
is one thing that is so great about them is

168
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,050
that they are very collectively conscious.
I mean we all went there, forty-five of them

169
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:09,050
just jumped in, from all over the world to
come to Russia because very interesting now.

170
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,790
You won't believe they looked after us like
lords, gave them food, this, make all arrangements.

171
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:18,000
Where My program was there was a big dinner
they threw; not a single pie we had to pay

172
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
them. I mean there was no organization there,
nothing; no Sahaja Yoga, nothing. Only Oleg

173
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:35,710
was there; nothing in Leningrad- and Oleg
was actually in Moscow, and even to touch

174
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:45,460
the platform on which I was sitting there
was a big cue and when I went away also they

175
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,890
were touching the platform, can you imagine.
They said: "We have never heard of such a

176
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:01,890
thing, it's such a great thing. I cannot believe
it there such a thing exists." And they're

177
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:09,119
all very well-educated people.
They are scientists, lots of scientists, doctors,

178
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,119
architects, businessmen, all kinds of things.
And the ministers of the Supreme Council.

179
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:24,619
What do you say? They came to my program.
They all touched My Feet. I said: "What world

180
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:31,619
is this?" And they haven't got this sense
that you are a minister or anything; everybody

181
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:40,520
just the same. Of course that's the thanks
to communism. But communism has given them

182
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:47,520
something very very great and that is collectivity;
they know how to share. I just really didn't

183
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:03,839
know to really measure out their potential,
really, I couldn't make out. They're all waiting

184
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:12,440
for Me there.
They made a film out of Me already, and they

185
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,920
showed it and all the film had nothing but
vibrations and some light tuck tuck on people

186
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,630
and all that. So that film became very popular,
they made a lot of money out of that. All

187
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:28,630
that they have given to Sahaja Yoga now. And
first only they brought lot of money I said:

188
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,950
"Why? For what?"
They said: "For Sahaja Yoga."

189
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,369
I said: "I don't need any money just now."
Lot of money.

190
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:39,990
"No but we've saved this for You, we saved
for You.

191
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:46,990
I said: "But you never knew".
When I was going for this another seminar,

192
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:53,920
this Yoga seminar My husband said: "What's
the use of going there now? You've been there

193
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,730
eight days now. Again for the seminar? Anybody
can look after".

194
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,210
I said: "I have to go."
He said: "Why?"

195
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,099
"To break the Eastern Block."
He said: "How will You break?"

196
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,099
I said: "There will be all of them there in
the seminar."

197
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:10,390
Really it happened. They gave Me only forty-five
minutes. I spoke for thirty minutes and for

198
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,900
fifteen minutes I gave them Realization. See,
and in that fifteen minutes all of these were

199
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:23,130
from all East Germany, from Czechoslovakia,
Poland; everybody was there. All of them walked

200
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,150
with Me out; there was nobody left in the
hall for any other lectures, and they gave

201
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,210
Me their addresses. "You must come to Poland,
You must come to this, You must come to East

202
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:40,940
Germany." And just after that this triggering
took place and they all started. But they

203
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,299
must be very powerful means, that's the point
you must remember. From every country there

204
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:52,299
could be ten or fifteen people who could have
attended this. All together there were only

205
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:59,299
three hundred delegates. And in Romania also
[spacing] I found people were very spiritual,

206
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:03,619
and I said: "Romania will be all right. Don't
you worry." It has happened there also. They

207
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:10,619
have broken the whole shackles. Then came-
before that was the Hungary, you see; they

208
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,079
said: "What about Hungary, Mother?"
I said: "Let there be one Sahaja Yogi from

209
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:24,349
Hungary." And there was one; he was quite
sick though. Hungary became free.

210
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:28,940
So you are the channels, you are the ones
who are going to work it out. If it was not

211
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,099
so you think I would have asked you to do
all these things? I would have done it Myself.

212
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:40,940
I can't. It is you have to do and you must
understand your responsibilities. You should

213
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:47,940
not go into the same mundane nonsensical ideas
but come forward with it and work it out.

214
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:55,460
You can break all these shackles completely,
if you have that power within you. But if

215
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:01,480
you, who are the one who are the one who are
going to transmit this, are not equipped and

216
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,480
are not strong enough what will I do? How
can I emit? Still we are going in that small

217
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:15,670
circle of: "Me, my family, my children, my,
my, my, my". So it's very important.

218
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:24,299
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier; I should
have come. There's nothing wrong with you

219
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:31,410
that I didn't come. But I wanted to see how
you grow, and I think this is not the way

220
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:38,410
we are going to grow at all; we are not going
to get separated. We are going to live together.

221
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:43,599
If you have any problems let Me know. But
you should immediately try to find out some

222
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,599
place- big one, immediately. We all can contribute.
From all over the world people will contribute;

223
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:57,680
I know that. Same thing in England, you know;
England is another mess.

224
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,460
We got so much money for Shudy Camps, and
in the Shudy Camps who lives are people who

225
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:08,460
have no money, paying nothing. Like Hounslow
house nobody paid anything, living free. English

226
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,569
are the worst in this, the worst of all, I
should say; and I don't know how they are

227
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:21,539
going to come up now; everybody has given
up. The leaders say: "Mother no use making

228
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:25,410
any house, anything for them; they'll all
come with their bag and baggage and we'll

229
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:32,410
have to pay for even their food". But now
we are getting some better-educated people,

230
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:40,039
some professionals and things, but still I
would say that England this Shudy Camps has

231
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:47,119
failed completely. We wanted about seven doctors
to see to this. We had made everything arrangements

232
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,380
beautifully done, worked very hard for it.
I put in such a lot of money in there; effort,

233
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:00,380
planning ; everything has all failed. Is just
haunted by some people who have no place to

234
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:08,450
go to. This is another kind. What's the use
of their collectivity there? Except that it's

235
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:16,089
a pressure on us in every way. Now you have
to show them. You were running very good ashrams,

236
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:28,900
no doubt. There were no such problems, no
such things happening, and then something

237
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:38,480
went wrong here; I know that also. Because
of that we should not give up our unity. Has

238
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:47,869
happened something; doesn't matter; we should
reunite. Unless and until we are united we

239
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:57,319
cannot fight. And the negativity is at your
door that can enter through even Sahaja Yogis.

240
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:05,930
As it had through your leaders also; I know
that. But nobody told Me about it, surprisingly.

241
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:14,869
I've already said that you don't tell Me against
the leaders but you tell Me if they are doing

242
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:21,239
something wrong; is absolutely allowed. Nobody
wrote to Me a word till I Myself discovered

243
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:28,239
it. Otherwise from Australia I get at least
sometimes minimum of ten to twenty pages letters.

244
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:39,170
But not a word about what was happening here
or how people were dominating you and how

245
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:46,019
things were going worse. I had to discover
it. We are all one family, after all I'm your

246
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:51,970
Mother. If you don't tell Me, who is going
to tell Me about it? You have every right

247
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:58,970
to tell Me. Leaders is just a myth as such.
That's the way I can communicate. But if you

248
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:06,690
find anything wrong with any leader, or anything,
you should tell Me. I'm always available,

249
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:14,130
you can always telephone to Me, I can always
talk to you. How many people have talked to?

250
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,849
I never say: "no" if I'm there. Any Sahaja
Yogi is trying to telephone to Me, if I am

251
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:27,480
in England or if I'm available, I'll talk
to that person. Or if there is David Spiro

252
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:34,480
he can convey to Me, he'll communicate to
Me exactly what you tell.

253
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,819
So nobody told Me. I never knew what was happening.
You'll be amazed I even did not know that

254
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:47,819
the school was removed 
to Sydney. I did not know; nobody asked Me,
nobody told Me; I had no idea. I never knew.

255
00:54:57,529 --> 00:55:04,529
Suddenly the photographs of 

256
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:22,549
the children came and their eyes, you see:
"What's the matter? Where are they?" Then

257
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:53,079
they told us the school has been removed and
all that, and the children were not normal

258
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:46,670
at all. I was so shocked. Then I found out
that the school was removed without My knowledge,

259
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:41,739
without telling Me. So arbitrary and everything.
Nobody told Me. You have to tell Me, you have

260
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:06,989
to inform Me. Now, in My lifetime, if this
is the situation, I don't know what's going

261
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:32,890
to happen later. Will it be 

262
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:17,729
like other Christianity of Paul or another
Hinduism or another thing like that; after

263
01:00:55,609 --> 01:01:02,609
all 
you 

264
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:05,140
are Sahaja Yogis. And then you forget your
responsibilities because if you are together

265
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:56,220
you remember your responsibilities that 

266
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:56,430
you are carrying a big load, a cross you can
call it,a big load. Suddenly you remove your

267
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:21,579
hand: "Get out. I have nothing to do. I'm
alone, I'm separate". Who is going 

268
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:28,370
to carry this 

269
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:37,050
big load?
