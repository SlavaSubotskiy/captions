Advice, “Introspection and Meditation”. Shudy Camps (UK), 18 June 1988.

2
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,260
This year we won’t be having I think,

3
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,820
public programs in UK,

4
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,580
because also there are certain circumstances.

5
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,060
But whenever there is a circumstance

6
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,420
which, somehow or other, changes our programs,

7
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,060
we must immediately know

8
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,700
that there is a purpose behind all that change,

9
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,260
and we must immediately accept it

10
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,500
with an open heart – that Divine wants us to change.

11
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,740
Supposing I am going on a road

12
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,980
and people say, “You are lost your way Mother.”

13
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,140
That’s all right. I am never lost, because I am with Myself!

14
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,180
But I had to go by that particular road, is the point.

15
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,820
I had to do it, and that’s why I have…supposed to be,

16
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,820
not on that road and I have lost My way.

17
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:58,900
If you have that kind of a understanding,

18
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,620
and if you have that satisfaction in your heart,

19
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,020
then you’ll find life is worth much more than what you think it to be.

20
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Now, as it is, what was the reason, I thought,

21
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,540
that we have decided to have public programs

22
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
this year definitely, and we could not have public programs?

23
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,060
So the reason is that we have to consolidate.

24
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,020
In the growth of a tree, which is a living tree,

25
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,660
it happens that it moves in a particular direction up to a point,

26
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,940
till it has to change,

27
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,500
because there is no sun coming that side,

28
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,660
maybe there is no water levels arriving,

29
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,620
so they start changing.

30
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,140
In the same way, one has to understand that,

31
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,740
we are in the hands of the Divine,

32
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,980
and if some plans are changed,

33
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,220
it is reflecting back on us, and we have to see why.

34
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,500
And the why of it is that we have to consolidate.

35
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,020
Consolidation of sahaja yogis is very important.

36
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:45,060
The first thing to consolidate yourself, you must do introspection.

37
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,420
You must do introspection, is to reflect the light within

38
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,020
and see for yourself:

39
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,300
what have you done so far in Sahaja Yoga?

40
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,780
Where were you, How far you have gone,

41
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,420
and how far have you to go.

42
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,420
What is the thing that is lacking in you?

43
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,460
You’ll be surprised when you start seeing yourself,

44
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,260
in a very unbiased manner, not justifying yourself

45
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,300
not blaming any bhoots,

46
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,940
or need not blame any badhas within you, or somebody else.

47
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,700
If you start yourself [seeing] what has gone wrong with you

48
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,220
that you could not consolidate yourself properly,

49
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,820
you’ll be amazed that there has been problems

50
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,860
still lingering on which must be corrected.

51
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,900
Now these problems you can see very clearly.

52
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,340
In the light of the Spirit you can see them very clearly

53
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,740
that, “This has gone wrong with me.”

54
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,020
One of the most interesting things I’ve noticed is that

55
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Sahaja Yoga is all the time covered with some sort of a maya.

56
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,620
And this maya is ignorance, complete ignorance sometimes,

57
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,140
sometimes partially.

58
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,380
Now when you get into Sahaja Yoga you get blessed.

59
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,780
You get blessed maybe,

60
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,900
your family gets blessed, your children get blessed.

61
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,660
You get some sort of a blessing for your physical being.

62
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,780
Also for financial [side], you get jobs, you get money,

63
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,940
you get something exceptional, which is really miraculous.

64
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,020
Now people get very much lost in those achievements

65
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,980
and start drifting, thinking that,

66
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,620
“Oh, this is the blessing we have got now.

67
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,660
We don’t have to do anything anymore,”

68
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,900
that you are being rewarded sufficiently

69
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,620
for whatever you have done so far. That’s not so!

70
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,900
Is just a sort of a support to you comes

71
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,500
so that your faith should be fully established in Sahaja Yoga.

72
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,140
And specially, you should know Me, what I am.

73
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,580
But, if you go on still drifting,

74
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,420
then maybe some of these blessings may turn out to be curses,

75
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,140
and you might feel that what a curse it has fallen upon us

76
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,340
and how it has gone in the wrong way.

77
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,340
For some people it takes time to feel,

78
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,060
to get to the feel of the blessings.

79
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,780
For example, mostly, according to the modern ideas,

80
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,540
we think that to get more money is the biggest blessing.

81
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,620
So, so many get that also.

82
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,820
But actually, it is not.

83
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,700
To get your peace within,

84
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,100
to get to your witness state,

85
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,980
and to feel your vibrations all right,

86
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,020
and to be in the center, all the time ascending,

87
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,980
is the real blessing.

88
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Because with that, you get everything else.

89
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,420
The completion is only possible

90
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,820
when you have the complete joy bubbling within yourself.

91
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,540
After all, everything is just a means to achieve joy,

92
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,860
to feel the joy.

93
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,500
It is not the end.

94
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,060
If it was, those people who have money,

95
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,140
those people who have good health,

96
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,700
those people who have all the success, so-called, with them,

97
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,380
they should have had been happy and peaceful,

98
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,780
but they are not, they are suffering,

99
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:18,580
they are suffering too much, and they are, in a way,

100
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,900
destroying themselves, day by day,

101
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,260
because they hate their lives, they can’t bear it.

102
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,940
They cannot understand why they are on this Earth.

103
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,860
So all these blessings that come to you,

104
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,740
all these changes that come to you,

105
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,860
all these new venues that open to you,

106
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,500
one has to know that it is for your benevolence,

107
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,580
everything for your benevolence,

108
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,740
and your benevolence is your ascent,

109
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,780
nothing else but your ascent.

110
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,740
The rest of it is all useless and fruitless.

111
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,660
Once you understand that this is

112
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,980
what you have to achieve in life,

113
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,500
that is what you have to enjoy, then it works out.

114
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,540
But in Sahaja Yoga as you see, it’s compassion and love.

115
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,620
It is not so much restrictions.

116
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,700
You are left to yourself to develop yourself.

117
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,500
Is your Spirit which has to guide you.

118
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,140
There’s no coaxing or correction going on all the time.

119
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:41,220
But it is left to you to understand yourself,

120
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,900
to see for yourself, and work it out.

121
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,860
But one of the criteria should be

122
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,780
that “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

123
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,060
Now what have I done for Mother?”

124
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,700
These two things are very important to understand.

125
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,060
Whatever small thing I could do for Sahaja Yoga

126
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,500
is important because

127
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,340
if you are intelligent, you can see

128
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,740
that this is the greatest thing you have to do

129
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,140
is to work for God.

130
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,060
This is the most important thing so far

131
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,740
human beings have indulged into,

132
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,500
is the highest type of enterprise

133
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:39,380
that human beings have ever had a chance to indulge into

134
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,460
and what a chance it is too!

135
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,660
You may say that, “Mother we are mediocres,

136
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,340
we are no good, we are useless,”

137
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,820
but you are chosen.

138
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,820
You are the one chosen so there must be something about you.

139
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,140
You might not have seen that part within yourself

140
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,500
which is going to work out this great work of God.

141
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,580
So you have to locate and find out:

142
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,500
“Why am I selected for Sahaja Yoga?

143
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,500
What can I do in Sahaja Yoga?

144
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,500
What can I work it out in Sahaja Yoga?”

145
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,260
This should be a constant reminder to you that,

146
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,740
“I have been chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

147
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,780
I want to take full advantage of Sahaja Yoga.”

148
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,980
Supposing somebody doesn’t have money,

149
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,980
he expects that Sahaja Yoga should give money,

150
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,980
must give jobs, must give this, must give that,

151
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,340
must have children, must give good health,

152
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
all that. Expectations are all right.

153
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,380
But “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

154
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,980
This is another point of introspection.

155
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,500
Very important to see that

156
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,100
we have to do something for Sahaja Yoga.

157
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,740
It’s not money, it’s not work,

158
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,900
it’s not thinking, it’s not any kind of a support.

159
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,180
But one of them, the most important thing is,

160
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,500
how many people you have given realization to?

161
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,540
You have to count.

162
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,100
How many people you have been able to give realization to,

163
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,420
how many people you have talked about Sahaja Yoga.

164
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,340
You may think that you give realization to some people,

165
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,060
they come, they disappear – doesn’t matter.

166
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,260
They will ultimately come to you.

167
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,820
Today you try on some, they’ll be lost.

168
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,060
Again tomorrow. You have to relentlessly work for it.

169
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,900
As you know I’ve worked very hard in UK.

170
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,420
My coming to UK itself was all predetermined.

171
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,980
There was a need for Me to come here,

172
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,140
to make the heart work better.

173
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,860
But heart is lethargic, you know that,

174
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,100
and lethargic heart gets all kinds of problems.

175
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,620
But all these years I have been working,

176
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,060
every year, whatever time I could give for sahaja yogis,

177
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,780
for their problems, for Sahaja Yoga,

178
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,900
for their minutest problem,

179
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,100
for any kind of help they needed,

180
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,660
every sort, I have tried to work it out.

181
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,260
Directly, indirectly, you are all blessed.

182
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,980
Still, what about you people who are now yogis?

183
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,700
You are saints.

184
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,460
You must see a photograph that I have,

185
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,100
very interesting photograph, where you are all certified saints!

186
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
Have you seen that photograph?

187
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Not yet? You better see it, let’s have it!

188
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,140
The photograph is in My box, I think, yes.

189
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,260
You are all certified saints!

190
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,260
By the Divine, not by any cardinal or by any pope.

191
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,420
So what are all these saints doing?

192
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,980
One saint which is certified by pope,

193
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,620
who is artificially certified,

194
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,100
is such a big thing, you know.

195
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,980
What about you, who have been certified by God Almighty?

196
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,820
You are still busy with your work,

197
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,140
you are still busy with your little, little things,

198
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:44,820
you are still busy with your small lives and small families.

199
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,820
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

200
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,060
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

201
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,140
for a person who is of a generous nature,

202
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,860
means a person who is a saint,

203
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,860
the whole world is his own family.

204
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,860
Are you still only worried about your own family?

205
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,660
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

206
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,820
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

207
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,500
about his own child, about his own house,

208
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,300
he worries about the whole world.

209
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,900
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

210
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,300
You are very powerful people.

211
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,980
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

212
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,620
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

213
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,220
or you have to be people who are

214
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,980
some sort of politicians, or something.

215
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,340
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

216
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,140
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

217
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,660
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

218
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,220
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

219
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,660
You can’t just be in Niranand.

220
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,580
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

221
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,660
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

222
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,340
And you have to think about them,

223
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,060
not only your problems that, “Mother

224
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,580
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

225
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,300
But you have to worry about the whole world.

226
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,340
You have to think, what’s happening in the world,

227
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,660
what are the problems of the world.

228
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,660
You are responsible for that.

229
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,900
Not only that, but you have to pray.

230
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,500
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

231
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

232
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,740
from yourself, from your smaller life,

233
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,460
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

234
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:59,420
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

235
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,420
that all these problems should be solved.

236
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,020
This is your job for which you are selected.

237
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,420
Your asking is going to work out

238
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,700
because as you know, I am desire-less.

239
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,980
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

240
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,780
The protection, the affection, the compassion

241
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,900
of Mother is with you.

242
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,740
But you have to look after this world

243
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,500
and show the concern that you have,

244
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,740
not to live with a very limited areas,

245
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,260
and with a very limited ways.

246
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,340
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

247
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,380
“UK problems are our problems.” No

248
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Your problems extend to

249
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,740
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

250
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,820
And you have to worry about all of them.

251
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,660
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

252
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,500
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

253
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,620
So, you have to see to it that

254
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,140
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

255
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,980
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

256
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,940
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

257
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,180
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

258
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,420
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

259
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,980
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

260
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,060
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

261
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,660
Then there are general problems as you see.

262
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,140
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

263
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,140
or whatever you may say,

264
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,820
so you have to put your attention to America.

265
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,740
You have to stretch your attention outside,

266
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,260
not inside

267
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,180
just worried about yourself, about your family,

268
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,780
about your house, about your children.

269
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,860
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

270
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,740
your problems are solved in the house,

271
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,140
in the smaller circle they are solved.

272
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
You have to pay attention outside!

273
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,340
Now these days there are televisions,

274
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,180
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

275
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,780
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

276
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,420
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

277
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,900
But now there are important things that are happening

278
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,940
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

279
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,940
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

280
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,220
where you have to put your attention.

281
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,860
You should become aware of your personality,

282
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,500
it’s not a personality that can be

283
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,660
completely involved into a very small area.

284
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,500
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

285
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,340
into all the problems of the universe,

286
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,580
all the problems there are.

287
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,260
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

288
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,740
in a very collective way.

289
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,660
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

290
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,740
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.

291
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,260
Would you like to have a look, all of you?

292
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,820
Just see! All of you, sitting in Ganapatipule.

293
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,060
So stretch out your vibrations. Stretch out your attentions.

294
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,500
And you’ll be amazed that

295
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,860
all other stupid problems that you have will be finished.

296
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,140
Now have a look. Let the children see first of all.

297
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,500
Just see. You all have vibrations on top of your head.

298
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:02,740
Let them grow, I tell you, I’m just waiting for them to grow!

299
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,740
So the attitude toward ourselves should be

300
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,900
to be aware of our own glory, of our own position,

301
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,180
to know that we are saints,

302
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,740
that we have reached a stage where we are at the highest,

303
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,500
and that, now, we have become the light

304
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,820
and we have to give light to others.

305
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,860
If you see, in the Bible, Christ has said something,

306
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,500
which is very important, that you
don’t put the light under the table.

307
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,900
That’s what it is. You have to put the light on a pedestal.

308
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,900
And that’s what it is that

309
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,900
you have to put your light on the citadel,

310
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,500
at a very highest point to give light to others.

311
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,060
And this is working both ways

312
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,940
if you start understanding what you are,

313
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,340
what you have to be aware of, what is your situation,

314
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,300
what is your powers, what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga,

315
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:26,340
what is the debt you have towards Sahaja Yoga,

316
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,660
and what you have to give for Sahaja Yoga.

317
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,860
How Sahaja Yoga has made you so capable,

318
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,460
so good, so nice.

319
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,900
Are you righteous enough? Are you behaving properly?

320
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,820
Are you doing all the rightful things,

321
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,620
which are necessary?

322
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,740
Because it is only you who can do it.

323
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,580
You are the people with a very very special energies

324
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,420
and special contacts with the spiritual life,

325
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,900
and if you start behaving like all other mundane, nonsensical people,

326
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,140
limiting yourself to your family, your children,

327
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,540
your nonsensical previous lives,

328
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,020
you’ll be lost.

329
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,300
Lost to yourself and lost to everyone.

330
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,460
The problems are much more than what you know about.

331
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,420
That is the understanding you have to reach,

332
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,140
that Mother has made us yogis.

333
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,980
We are saints.

334
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,740
And we have to show to the world the right path.

335
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,500
She has told us that we are the light

336
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,500
and we have to show to people which way to go,

337
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,060
how to go further.

338
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,060
Instead of that everybody seems to be a problem,

339
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,980
seems to be in a very small little whirlpool,

340
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,260
going round and round and round.

341
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,580
How can that be?

342
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,260
I’ve told you many a times, look at these false gurus.

343
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,660
They have no vibrations, they don’t know anything

344
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,180
about Kundalini, nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

345
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,420
But how much they are doing!

346
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,860
While what are we doing?

347
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,900
We’re struggling still with ourselves and with our problems,

348
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,500
with our own ideas, with our very small-mindedness

349
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,500
and chicken-heartedness.

350
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,620
Now it is for you to understand.

351
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,220
It is for you to decide about yourself.

352
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,900
It is your own desire, it is your own bigness,

353
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,300
your own magnanimity, which has to come forward.

354
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,060
To see for yourself what you are capable of,

355
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,740
what you can do.

356
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,700
It’s very easy for people to say that,

357
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,900
“Oh Mother, it’s too much. I can’t do anything about it.”

358
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,540
Or somebody to say that, “Mother, I’m busy with my family.”

359
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,780
Or somebody to say, “I’m busy with my children.”

360
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,860
You have come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

361
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,140
I have given you realization for that?

362
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,580
All these blessings have come to you for that?

363
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,420
So the consolidation that you have to do is very important.

364
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,340
You can see it clearly that’s why

365
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,420
we could not have any public programs,

366
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,300
because we really need consolidation in UK.

367
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
Though I have lived in UK for so many years,

368
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,460
people take me for granted here.

369
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,940
Because I am here, because I am staying here,

370
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,660
they think if we go to the airport, finished!

371
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,580
We have done all the haj, everything.

372
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,660
“We’ve been to the airport; we’ve seen Mother, finished!”

373
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,660
What’s the use of seeing Me?

374
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,140
What have I given you?

375
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,260
Is your light spreading?

376
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,980
How many people have got realization from you?

377
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,580
Just find out, how many people

378
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,580
have learned Sahaja Yoga from you,

379
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,300
or from your lives, or from your wisdom,

380
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,820
or from your behavior?

381
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,940
That is the way, that is the criteria.

382
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,140
It’s not that

383
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,660
“All right, I have sent Mother Her money for Her travel.”

384
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,060
That’s not sufficient.

385
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,100
At My age, from India, if you see any lady at My age,

386
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,700
she walks with a stick, she can’t climb even one step

387
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,900
Indian women can’t, because of the heat that they have suffered.

388
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,580
But I’m traveling, you know how I’m traveling,

389
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,780
how much I am doing. What about My family?

390
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,420
I deprive them of My company, I deprive My husband of My company,

391
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,500
everybody is just without Me.

392
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,140
I am traveling traveling every day,

393
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,980
you know that very well, and I’m working so very hard.

394
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,540
Sometimes I sleep at two o’clock, sometimes at three o’clock.

395
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,340
This time Harsh was with Me,

396
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,740
and I saw him, he was fagged out!

397
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,900
So I was saying you people do only relay race.

398
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,780
I am in Australia, all right, Australians are working.

399
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,180
Then I’m in Austria, then Austrians are working,

400
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,260
then they are having a nice time there!

401
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,860
I’m in UK, all right, little bit in UK, little work done.

402
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,380
Then they all sit down nicely, enjoy.

403
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,700
What about Me? I am having a marathon!

404
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,740
In the same way you have to feel,

405
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,740
after all, what is My gain in it?

406
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,140
What do I gain out of it?

407
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,260
I gain something:

408
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,140
I have brought My children back to normal conditions,

409
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,420
I have taken them to the Kingdom of God.

410
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,060
You have to do the same.

411
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,580
You have to take them to the Kingdom of God.

412
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,340
But if you, yourself, are involved into your own mayas,

413
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,660
you’ll be everyday going down and down and down and down.

414
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,060
I may shout, I may say anything, it will not go into your heads,

415
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,260
it will never click with you.

416
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,740
You’ll be all stranded wherever you are,

417
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,260
because you don’t want to see.

418
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,580
For that I would say, you have one advantage,

419
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,740
especially in UK. You are all very intelligent people.

420
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,180
You have intelligence, no doubt,

421
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,140
you are not idiots like Americans.

422
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,060
You are intelligent.

423
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,260
This intelligence became cunningness once upon a time,

424
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,660
and now you are tired of your cunning.

425
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,900
Indians have learned the cunning from you,

426
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,860
they have become really very cunning.

427
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,900
But you are tired of your cunningness,

428
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:53,900
so now you are tired, fed up, fagged out, and lethargic.

429
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,900
But with your intelligence you can understand

430
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,260
that this is such an important work our Mother is doing.

431
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,580
You’ll go down in the history!

432
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,820
Every word you say, everything you say,

433
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,340
every way you behave,

434
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,260
everything is going to go down in the history!

435
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Not how many children you produced,

436
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,100
or what sort of a wife you have,

437
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,540
but what you did for Sahaja Yoga.

438
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,980
Remember that.

439
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,580
History is going to record everything,

440
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,980
whatever you have done

441
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,780
and whatever you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,980
It’s not showing off.

443
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:37,580
It’s not just a demonstration.

444
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,340
It’s not talking big.

445
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,980
It’s nothing of the kind.

446
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,580
It’s actually, really, totally what you have achieved,

447
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,340
is the point, will be recorded.

448
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,180
At least God knows hypocrisy, and God knows bombastic temperaments.

449
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,100
It’s God who knows where you are,

450
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,980
and what you are up to.

451
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,180
You cannot befool God, one thing you must realize.

452
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,580
But when you are befooling God, you are befooling your Self,

453
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,500
your Spirit, your realization, your own ascent!

454
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,540
So we have to be careful.

455
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,060
As a Mother I would say try to be

456
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,180
introspecting yourself very carefully

457
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,620
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

458
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,180
What have we done for other people who are drifting?

459
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,700
What has been our behavior towards other sahaja yogis?

460
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,260
How much peace and love and compassion we have given to others?

461
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,980
How much understanding and tolerance we have shown to others?

462
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,820
If somebody gets here a little more money,

463
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,340
he becomes so bombastic, he becomes so aggressive,

464
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,580
he becomes so rude.

465
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,660
I can’t believe it!

466
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,380
How can money lure you into these vices?

467
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,060
You are not ordinary people, you are the saints

468
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,100
whose feet were washed by the River Ganges.

469
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,580
Try to understand your glory. Try to understand your own powers,

470
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:32,500
your own position as saintly people, sahaja yogis,

471
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,260
which are above all the saints

472
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,420
because you know how to give realization,

473
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,380
you know everything about Kundalini,

474
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,620
you know everything about realization.

475
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,500
How many people knew about it?

476
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,420
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking

477
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,580
I have given all this knowledge to some bunch of fools

478
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,060
who do not know what is the value.

479
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,180
As Christ has said, “Don’t throw pearls before the swines.”

480
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,660
But I don’t think I have done that mistake.

481
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,660
I cannot believe I have done that mistake,

482
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,900
that I have thrown pearls before swines.

483
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,180
I have not done it.

484
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,420
But, it is for you to decide where you stand, in what category.

485
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,580
It is so obvious that

486
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,780
it’s a very precarious time we are passing through.

487
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,660
It’s very important [that] we have to fight it out.

488
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,820
It’s much more than any wars you have fought.

489
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,260
It’s much more than any struggle human beings ever had.

490
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,900
It’s such a horrible world that is being created,

491
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,260
and we have to transform it.

492
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,420
It’s a tremendous task.

493
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,420
For that you have to work out

494
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,420
in a very sincere and a innate manner.

495
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,260
And I’m sure one day will come

496
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,500
that in the history of this world

497
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,060
sahaja yogis will have their names written with golden letters.

498
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,820
I am sure this will work out.

499
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,180
I am sure this has to work out,

500
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,820
and that you all have to achieve it,

501
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,180
collectively, with one mind, with one heart.

502
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,820
What should I sacrifice?

503
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,340
What should I do?

504
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,580
How should I help?

505
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,980
What is my contribution?

506
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:37,180
I wish I could see those days in My lifetime.

507
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,940
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

508
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,420
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

509
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,340
Please close your eyes.

510
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,540
All of you close your eyes.

511
00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:01,420
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing in the halls

512
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,900
wherever we had public programs.

513
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,940
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

514
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,060
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

515
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,340
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

516
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,140
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

517
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:34,820
So, you have to thank your Spirit that it has brought light to your attention,

518
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,660
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

519
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,460
has to enlighten the whole world.

520
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,420
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

521
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:57,380
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

522
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,140
With all sincerity and understanding

523
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,980
that you are connected with the Divine and whatever you desire will happen

524
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,620
with full confidence in yourself.

525
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,340
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

526
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,260
on the left hand side, on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

527
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:34,340
And now here is the center of your dharma.

528
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,140
Here you have to pray that,

529
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,420
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

530
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:49,420
Let people see the light through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

531
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:55,140
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

532
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:03,220
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

533
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,140
and a desire to ascend."

534
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:20,660
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

535
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,140
on the left hand side. Press it.

536
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,740
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

537
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,540
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

538
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:47,820
that "our Mother has given us the full idea how the Divine works.

539
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,580
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

540
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,380
that we could bear and understand.

541
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,180
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

542
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,420
I have seen if the man is a leader,

543
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,620
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

544
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,260
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga, the husband doesn't know anything about it.

545
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:24,580
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

546
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,900
so that I can give realization to people,

547
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:46,820
make them understand what is Divine Law,

548
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,940
what is Kundalini, and what are the chakras.

549
00:42:54,060 --> 00:43:00,820
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga than all these mundane things."

550
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,780
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

551
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:12,500
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

552
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:20,980
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit, and I have my own guru

553
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,580
which is the Spirit. I am master of my own.

554
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:35,660
Let there be no abandonment. Let there be dignity in my character.

555
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,100
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

556
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:46,900
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:56,580
Let me not show off, but have a deep, deep knowledge about God's love

558
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,900
and His doings so that when people come to me,

559
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,700
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

560
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:15,140
and give them this great knowledge with humility and love."

561
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,940
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

562
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:31,340
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

563
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,260
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

564
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,340
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

565
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,900
which we have seen is so tremendous.

566
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:55,420
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

567
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:02,900
And my love should resound the name of God."

568
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:13,940
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.

569
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:23,140
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi that is on the left Vishuddhi,

570
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:30,380
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

571
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:40,260
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt, because I know it is falsehood.

572
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:49,260
I will not escape my faults, but face them and eradicate them.

573
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,820
I will not try to find faults with others,

574
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:59,980
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, let me remove their faults."

575
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:06,380
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

576
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,460
"Let my collectivity

577
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:22,500
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race is my own family,

578
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:29,220
my own children, my home, my everything.

579
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,940
Let me get that feeling completely,

580
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,780
innately built within myself that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

581
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,220
because we all have one Mother.

582
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,740
And let my concern go to the whole world,

583
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,540
to know what are their problems and how can,

584
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,820
through my true desire power, solve that.

585
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,940
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

586
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:16,940
and innately to remove all of them from the basis of which they are,

587
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,740
from the basis from which they are generated.

588
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,580
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

589
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,860
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

590
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,020
through my saintly powers."

591
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:39,180
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

592
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,100
Now here you have to say, first of all

593
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,740
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

594
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,580
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

595
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,100
who jump in and jump out.

596
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:02,020
But, first of all and foremost, I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

597
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,300
because they are all better than me.

598
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,540
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

599
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,580
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

600
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,340
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

601
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,860
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

602
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,660
This humility has to come within us, so you have to say here

603
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,180
"Let the humility in my heart, in a true sense,

604
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:41,780
not hypocritical, work out this feeling of forgiveness,

605
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:51,620
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

606
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,780
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

607
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,420
and push back your head here. And you have to say here,

608
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,980
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

609
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,580
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

610
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,500
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

611
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,500
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You, please forgive us.

612
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,300
" You have to ask for forgiveness.

613
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,700
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

614
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,540
I don't have to tell you again and again.

615
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,500
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me. At Sahasrara, put your hand,

616
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,700
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

617
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,140
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

618
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,340
And Mother, thank You very much for making us understand how great we are.

619
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,260
And thank You very much for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

620
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,980
And thank You very much for raising us higher, much higher,

621
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,820
than from where we were.

622
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,260
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

623
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,820
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

624
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,900
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

625
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,580
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

626
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,780
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

627
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:16,300
Press it hard and move it hard.

628
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,540
Now take down your hands.

629
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,020
Heads are all very hot.

630
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,020
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

631
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,940
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

632
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,700
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

633
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,780
Now again, second one.

634
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,140
Now the third one.

635
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,900
Now the fourth one.

636
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,660
Now the fifth.

637
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,540
Now the sixth one.

638
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,820
And now the seventh.

639
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,780
Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

640
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,620
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

641
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,540
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

642
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,020
one knot.

643
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,300
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

644
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,780
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

645
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,180
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

646
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,940
Take it to your head, push back your head and give it two knots there,

647
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,740
one and two.

648
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,180
Now let's do the other one.

649
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,940
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

650
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,340
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

651
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:31,420
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

652
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,340
Now see your vibrations.

653
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,180
See your vibrations. Like this.

654
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,300
All the children, see your vibrations. Like this. Put your hands.

655
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:21,300
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

656
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,540
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
