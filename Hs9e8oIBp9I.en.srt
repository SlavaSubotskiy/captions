1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:14,548
Today we have such a great opportunity
to celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:26,484
He was born in a manger.

3
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:32,235
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:43,263
That He should be born in a manger
in difficult situations,

5
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,671
to show that whether you are born
poor or rich,

6
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:56,045
whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems,

7
00:00:56,246 --> 00:01:01,687
if you have Divinity within you it shines
by itself.

8
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:17,737
As the Christianity took a very wrong
deviated line,

9
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:24,958
they have never been able to understand
the significance of Christ.

10
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:35,133
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely
not possible.

11
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:40,737
Most of the people think that it's some
sort of a mythical story.

12
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:46,949
But in India we do believe

13
00:01:47,150 --> 00:02:02,029
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out
of Her own vibrations

14
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,034
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

15
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:12,885
We accept it. But not in the West.

16
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,049
They will never accept such a thing

17
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:22,409
because their mental side is over-developed
and dominates them.

18
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:30,827
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

19
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:35,708
to understand that above all is God.

20
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,625
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

21
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:45,518
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

22
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,701
it has not provided any proper guidance.

23
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:57,914
On the contrary, whenever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

24
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,539
But it's very simple to understand
for Indians,

25
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,309
that anything is possible for God.

26
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,423
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

27
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:21,342
Because of this mental attitude which
is much lower

28
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:26,154
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

29
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:30,661
the ordinary, mundane type of this
superficial knowledge

30
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:40,007
can never allow the personality to accept
the greatness of God.

31
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,606
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

32
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:54,515
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

33
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:58,150
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

34
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,351
They will not say: "How is he going to meet
God?" but they accept, you see:

35
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:02,932
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

36
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:08,145
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

37
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:14,431
sitting there, nicely singing songs,
bhajans of God,

38
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:18,285
doing nothing on the roadside.

39
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:21,397
So he said: "Oh, so you are going
to meet God?"

40
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:26,556
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have
you any message for Him?"

41
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:30,527
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

42
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:37,236
but He should arrange for my food, because
I think the food is now finishing."

43
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:40,933
He said: "Really, that's what you want
me to tell Him?"

44
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:49,326
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course
He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

45
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:53,226
So he went ahead and he met another
gentleman

46
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,517
who was standing on his head, or
in a Christian way I would say

47
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:01,502
he was going to church every day with nice
suits, and singing hymns every day,

48
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:04,847
listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say;

49
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:08,620
and in the Indian way we can say he was
going to the temple every day,

50
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:13,502
standing on his head, doing all kinds
of yoga asanas and everything.

51
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:18,539
And he asked him: "Please go and ask
God - I've tried everything.

52
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,249
When is He going to meet me? I would
like to see Him.

53
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,046
I would like to have His darshan."
He said: "All right."

54
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:29,859
So he went to God,

55
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,397
and whatever work he had he finished
with it,

56
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,301
and then God asked him: "Have you got
anything to tell Me?"

57
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:47,473
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one
gentleman while coming

58
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:51,509
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

59
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:54,432
and when will God meet me? I am standing
on my head,

60
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:58,817
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga
asanas, and all kinds of things,

61
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:02,356
and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying,

62
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:08,277
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will
God meet me?'"

63
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,252
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little
more.

64
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:17,477
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga
will come we'll see!"

65
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:32,684
So then even he said: "And there’s another
one who was on the road, You see.

66
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,882
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

67
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,030
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

68
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,208
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask
God to arrange it for me.'"

69
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,422
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

70
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:48,969
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

71
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,288
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we
arranged it, all that."

72
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:55,568
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

73
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,765
you know, that this fellow who is trying
all these things

74
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:00,982
and God is still saying that he has
to wait.

75
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:04,639
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that,

76
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,954
and why is it so much impressed by this
another fellow

77
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:14,392
who is doing nothing to seek God?

78
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,834
So then God realized that he is in some
sort of an illusion.

79
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:22,733
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

80
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:28,415
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there

81
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:36,883
was that He made a camel pass through
the eye of a needle.'"

82
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,769
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

83
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,052
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see
the reaction."

84
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,422
So he went down. So this is, the first one
met him, he said: "What God has said?"

85
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:53,330
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

86
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,952
Before that you go round like this."

87
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,202
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

88
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,796
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me
sometime?

89
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:05,619
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

90
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,569
And he was quite disappointed.

91
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,301
So he went and he asked him that:
"What did you see with,

92
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,859
there when you went to see God?"
He said: "I saw that, you know,

93
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,059
He passed a camel through the eye
of an, of a needle."

94
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:25,094
He said: "What? How is it possible?
It's impossible!" -

95
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:28,045
Now mental - "How is it possible,

96
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:31,211
that a camel can pass through the eye,
it's not possible,

97
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:36,666
see the volume of this one and such
a little thing. How can he pass?

98
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,666
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

99
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:43,894
you are trying to show off, that's all. I,
I don't believe in all this nonsense.

100
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:47,591
You see, you are just telling me lies,
and don't try to befool me."

101
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:52,405
So he went to another person who was
on the street eating nicely.

102
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:55,389
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had
arranged before you reached there,

103
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,785
I know it was all right after all. You see,
He looks after me all the time.

104
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:05,489
So what did you see when you went there?"
He said: "I saw that God Almighty

105
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,477
passed a camel through an eye of a
needle. It's a very amazing thing."

106
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:17,883
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God,
do you know He is God?

107
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:24,968
Do you know He is God? God can do
anything. He can do anything!"

108
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:33,528
That's made him understand, that if you
understand that God is all-powerful -

109
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:37,922
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can
move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

110
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:41,240
It doesn't mean that!

111
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:54,242
But it means He is all powerful.

112
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:58,343
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest
thing, and such things

113
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:03,706
which our brain, this mental side cannot
understand.

114
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:09,794
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

115
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:15,180
This is what God is.

116
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,026
He is the One who has created human beings.

117
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,250
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

118
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,706
If a potter creates a pot that means
he is beyond the pot.

119
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:27,437
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

120
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:33,133
And the potter has created the pot,
so that means that this pot

121
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:38,273
which is created by him has to be -
something which is made by him,

122
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:43,837
so he has to be much more powerful
than the pot is.

123
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:52,957
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond
the conception of human beings,

124
00:10:53,158 --> 00:11:02,904
that what a God it must be Who has made
this great computer.

125
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:07,475
We take everything for granted.

126
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:13,590
We cannot even make a particle of clay
ourself.

127
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,310
We cannot make anything, human beings
cannot make.

128
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,534
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you
can put this up.

129
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:25,508
If there is some clay, you can make some
sort of a house out of it.

130
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,099
But it’s all dead from the dead.

131
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:43,392
But can you make a candle which will
burn badhas?

132
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:54,862
You have seen it with your own eyes that
before My photograph the badhas burn.

133
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:58,129
Can you do that?

134
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:07,282
Now you, we have no, also the idea
of the complete, intricate working,

135
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:18,775
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic
explosive machinery,

136
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:24,450
how it works to create human beings,
to create all this universe,

137
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:31,782
to create all these beautiful flowers and
trees and everything.

138
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:36,751
Look at the stars. Look at how many
they are.

139
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:41,929
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

140
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,545
How He has made it?

141
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:56,716
When He wants to send His own Son, He
can send it the way He wants to send it.

142
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:10,351
Even to challenge this shows the mental
mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

143
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:19,143
So to accept it is only possible

144
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:23,301
when you have saints, real saints who
tell you,

145
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:29,997
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born
out of Gauri.

146
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:38,497
But to jump into it, into faith,

147
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:44,821
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start
seeing miracles taking place.

148
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:50,199
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place

149
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,484
and if there is another miracle that has to
take place it will take place in any case.

150
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:01,157
 We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

151
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:08,327
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt
you become again the same

152
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:15,816
human being which is just embedded
in the mud.

153
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,089
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

154
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,994
You are not flying in the air. Your roots
are down there.

155
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:31,505
But you are now lotuses,

156
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:38,916
and that's what is on top of the lotus,
this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

157
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:45,623
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which
came on this earth

158
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:56,922
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary,
as Mother Mary.

159
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,077
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out
of the sea.

160
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:10,049
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means,
you know, Marine means "the sea".

161
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,498
She was born out of the sea.

162
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:21,362
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She
could create a child. What's the harm?

163
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,356
She could do anything,

164
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:33,271
and this is the thing you have to rise
above.

165
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:37,408
Christians have to rise above this
Christianity,

166
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:41,602
and has to understand that it's such
a great thing that was Christ

167
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:48,320
Who came on this earth, Who was the
Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

168
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,445
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is
a very big thing

169
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,722
which one should try to understand.

170
00:15:54,923 --> 00:16:01,799
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

171
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:14,629
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first
created before creating anything,

172
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:22,690
any atmosphere, anything, because He is
the Omkara,

173
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:28,923
and the Omkara is the first breaking
of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

174
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:34,032
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.
From there started Omkara

175
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:39,285
and He is the One Who is the embodiment
of that Omkara.

176
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:43,318
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

177
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,823
was created first foremost thing, just
to create holiness, pavitrata.

178
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,269
When this holiness was created, this
pavitrata was created,

179
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:03,333
then everything was created in the sea
of that holiness.

180
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:12,652
And then He incarnated as Christ, but
as Mahavishnu,

181
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:18,351
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

182
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:26,271
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle
of Shri Ganesh.

183
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:34,231
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

184
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:41,126
So the, it was brought up, we should say,
by Mahavishnu, we can say,

185
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:47,973
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

186
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:51,274
In the Kundalini chart you can see that
the Shri Ganesha

187
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:56,380
is connected on the left-hand side
to the Ida Nadi,

188
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:03,828
and the Kundalini is above that.

189
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:11,093
So now what has happened is this, that
He transcended that part,

190
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:13,994
and if He had to come for the redemption,

191
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:19,261
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

192
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:22,846
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

193
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:30,713
or we should say, really conceived Him
within Himself as Christ,

194
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,525
and He became Mahavishnu.

195
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:45,244
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

196
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:52,793
It is beyond human mind to understand
how these things

197
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:59,627
are working out in that realm. Very
difficult.

198
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,870
But now you have got Realization, you can
feel in the cool breeze,

199
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:08,443
so many new things are happening to you.
So now believe Me,

200
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:13,616
that there is no unholy alliances

201
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:16,762
among the Gods and Goddesses, no
unholy alliances.

202
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:21,723
There is nothing that is human in them.

203
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:28,181
They are all divine, pure people.

204
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,599
Once you understand this point, then
you will understand

205
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:43,938
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be
a Son of Mahalakshmi,

206
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:48,478
was born to Him as Christ.

207
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:56,238
Because He had to come on Agnya,
and for the redemption,

208
00:19:56,439 --> 00:20:02,016
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption
part,

209
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:10,481
because at that stage He is for
the innocence, for the holiness,

210
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:17,820
for the wisdom or also for destroying
a negativity.

211
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:23,802
But He had to come up; only He,

212
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:34,189
only Ganesha could be brought to this
very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

213
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,126
Now why is it constricted? It's quite
a scientific thing

214
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:40,978
which I would not like to discuss today.

215
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,651
But it had to be constricted

216
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:47,179
and it goes on getting more constricted,
this Agnya chakra,

217
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,695
the more, the more we think, the more
we go into the left or right,

218
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:59,445
it goes on really becoming like this,
absolutely like this.

219
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:07,523
So in this very subtle area only Christ
could be settled,

220
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,862
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:18,431
He's even subtler than an atom, because
in the atom

222
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:23,214
those vibrations which move asymmetric
and symmetric movements

223
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:28,298
are subtler than the atom.

224
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:31,715
And this is the subtler of that also.

225
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,966
So in that little very constricted area,

226
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:46,786
only a personality like Christ, which is
nothing but purity.

227
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:59,460
There is no other element in Him
but purity.

228
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:08,678
All other Incarnations have all the five
elements in it.

229
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:15,476
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure
vibrations.

230
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:19,402
That's why He could walk on the water,

231
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:27,605
because there was no mass in His body,
no matter in His body. No matter.

232
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:33,131
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

233
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:38,723
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

234
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:44,362
or the what you can say, the thing that
came out of Her body.

235
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:49,160
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage
we can say

236
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:54,051
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

237
00:22:54,252 --> 00:23:00,914
but in the state of Christ it was no
longer there.

238
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:09,771
But the whole drama was played later on,
of His death and resurrection,

239
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:14,022
because He is the One who is responsible
for our resurrection,

240
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:19,562
because He is the Gate. He is the Path
because He is Shri Ganesh.

241
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:25,965
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate,
but He is not the destination.

242
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:32,622
His Mother is the destination.

243
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:39,533
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

244
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:45,223
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination
where you have to reach.

245
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,363
All these things were never told
in the Bible

246
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:56,139
because He could hardly live for four
years with public life.

247
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,937
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know.

248
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:07,768
Also there was a definite suppression
of all Divine things,

249
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:12,608
for these people are all commercialized
institutions,

250
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,756
as we have also in India all kinds
of commercial institutions.

251
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:22,388
But the only advantage in India is that
religion is not organized.

252
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:25,207
Thank God for that!

253
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:27,792
But they organized it, they organized
Christ,

254
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:30,750
they organized all His principles,
everything,

255
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:34,434
and now they think He was a good human
being.

256
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:37,787
What a certificate to give!

257
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:45,396
So today we are here to celebrate
the birth of Omkara.

258
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:50,693
It's a very big thing. I don't know
if you can realize it, what it is,

259
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:58,311
which moves into everything, whether it is
anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

260
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:05,782
into all the organizing of chemicals and
also the periodic laws,

261
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:15,140
and also in the gravity, into everything
that moves is this Omkara,

262
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:20,450
and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

263
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:25,827
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:30,509
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

265
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:35,999
How is it happening, these lights look
like Omkara?

266
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,557
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis,

267
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:43,576
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads -
there is Omkara?

268
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:52,659
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name
also, in Arabic?

269
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:57,767
Who is doing this?

270
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:04,359
It is He who is doing all those things.

271
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:13,865
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

272
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:21,563
He is the One who is handling all these
powers.

273
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:28,371
He doesn't enter into the photograph,
no, He does not,

274
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:32,233
but He plays a trick.

275
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:38,477
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

276
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:44,052
Through the light. The light passes
straight, in a straight line.

277
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:48,792
But if He wants, He can make the light
pass another way round.

278
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:52,552
He can just transform the light into
something else.

279
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:55,843
He can do whatever He likes.

280
00:26:56,044 --> 00:27:00,220
And that's what He does to convince you.

281
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,629
And He said that "Anything against Me
I'll tolerate,

282
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,390
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

283
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:11,949
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

284
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:20,734
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

285
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:24,182
So the in the whole play He is like
the sutra dhara,

286
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:28,180
He is the One who is the conductor,

287
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:34,948
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

288
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,010
And so it is very important to pray
to Shri Ganesha,

289
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:41,067
every time we have Puja, we have
to pray to Him

290
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:47,765
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord
Jesus Christ. Every time.

291
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:53,329
Without His auspiciousness, without His
help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

292
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:00,088
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting
here and He is the manager.

293
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,220
Supposing there is no management, how
will I speak here?

294
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:07,649
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

295
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:13,587
and you never see Him working out
everything, doing everything.

296
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,940
(Hindi talk)
