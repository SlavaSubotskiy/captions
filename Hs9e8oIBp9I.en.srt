1
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:14,467
Today we have such a great opportunity
to celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:26,404
He was born in a manger.

3
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:32,155
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:43,183
That He should be born in a manger
in difficult situations,

5
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:48,591
to show that whether you are born
poor or rich,

6
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:55,965
whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems,

7
00:00:56,166 --> 00:01:01,607
if you have Divinity within you it shines
by itself.

8
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:17,657
As the Christianity took a very wrong
deviated line,

9
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:24,878
they have never been able to understand
the significance of Christ.

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:35,053
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely
not possible.

11
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:40,657
Most of the people think that it's some
sort of a mythical story.

12
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:46,869
But in India we do believe

13
00:01:47,070 --> 00:02:01,949
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out
of Her own vibrations

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,954
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

15
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:12,805
We accept it. But not in the West.

16
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,969
They will never accept such a thing

17
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:22,329
because their mental side is over-developed
and dominates them.

18
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:30,747
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

19
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:35,628
to understand that above all is God.

20
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:40,545
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

21
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:45,438
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

22
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,621
it has not provided any proper guidance.

23
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:57,834
On the contrary, whenever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

24
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:04,459
But it's very simple to understand
for Indians,

25
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,229
that anything is possible for God.

26
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,343
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

27
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:21,262
Because of this mental attitude which
is much lower

28
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:26,074
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

29
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:30,581
the ordinary, mundane type of this
superficial knowledge

30
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:39,927
can never allow the personality to accept
the greatness of God.

31
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:46,526
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

32
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:54,435
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

33
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:58,070
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

34
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,271
They will not say: "How is he going to meet
God?" but they accept, you see:

35
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,852
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

36
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:08,065
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

37
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:14,351
sitting there, nicely singing songs,
bhajans of God,

38
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:18,205
doing nothing on the roadside.

39
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,317
So he said: "Oh, so you are going
to meet God?"

40
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:26,476
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have
you any message for Him?"

41
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:30,447
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

42
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:37,156
but He should arrange for my food, because
I think the food is now finishing."

43
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:40,853
He said: "Really, that's what you want
me to tell Him?"

44
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:49,246
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course
He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

45
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:53,146
So he went ahead and he met another
gentleman

46
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:56,437
who was standing on his head, or
in a Christian way I would say

47
00:04:56,638 --> 00:05:01,422
he was going to church every day with nice
suits, and singing hymns every day,

48
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:04,767
listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say;

49
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:08,540
and in the Indian way we can say he was
going to the temple every day,

50
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,422
standing on his head, doing all kinds
of yoga asanas and everything.

51
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:18,459
And he asked him: "Please go and ask
God - I've tried everything.

52
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,169
When is He going to meet me? I would
like to see Him.

53
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,966
I would like to have His darshan."
He said: "All right."

54
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:29,779
So he went to God,

55
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,317
and whatever work he had he finished
with it,

56
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:40,221
and then God asked him: "Have you got
anything to tell Me?"

57
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:47,393
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one
gentleman while coming

58
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:51,429
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

59
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,352
and when will God meet me? I am standing
on my head,

60
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:58,737
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga
asanas, and all kinds of things,

61
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:02,276
and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying,

62
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:08,197
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will
God meet me?'"

63
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:12,172
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little
more.

64
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:17,397
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga
will come we'll see!"

65
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:32,604
So then even he said: "And there’s another
one who was on the road, You see.

66
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:35,802
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

67
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,950
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

68
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,128
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask
God to arrange it for me.'"

69
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:45,342
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

70
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,889
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

71
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,208
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we
arranged it, all that."

72
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:55,488
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

73
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,685
you know, that this fellow who is trying
all these things

74
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,902
and God is still saying that he has
to wait.

75
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:04,559
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that,

76
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,874
and why is it so much impressed by this
another fellow

77
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:14,312
who is doing nothing to seek God?

78
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,754
So then God realized that he is in some
sort of an illusion.

79
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:22,653
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

80
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:28,335
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there

81
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:36,803
was that He made a camel pass through
the eye of a needle.'"

82
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:41,689
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

83
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,972
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see
the reaction."

84
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,342
So he went down. So this is, the first one
met him, he said: "What God has said?"

85
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:53,250
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

86
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,872
Before that you go round like this."

87
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:58,122
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

88
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,716
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me
sometime?

89
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:05,539
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

90
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,489
And he was quite disappointed.

91
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,221
So he went and he asked him that:
"What did you see with,

92
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:16,779
there when you went to see God?"
He said: "I saw that, you know,

93
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,979
He passed a camel through the eye
of an, of a needle."

94
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:25,014
He said: "What? How is it possible?
It's impossible!" -

95
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:27,965
Now mental - "How is it possible,

96
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,131
that a camel can pass through the eye,
it's not possible,

97
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:36,586
see the volume of this one and such
a little thing. How can he pass?

98
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:39,586
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

99
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:43,814
you are trying to show off, that's all. I,
I don't believe in all this nonsense.

100
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:47,511
You see, you are just telling me lies,
and don't try to befool me."

101
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:52,325
So he went to another person who was
on the street eating nicely.

102
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,309
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had
arranged before you reached there,

103
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,705
I know it was all right after all. You see,
He looks after me all the time.

104
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:05,409
So what did you see when you went there?"
He said: "I saw that God Almighty

105
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,397
passed a camel through an eye of a
needle. It's a very amazing thing."

106
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:17,803
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God,
do you know He is God?

107
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:24,888
Do you know He is God? God can do
anything. He can do anything!"

108
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:33,448
That's made him understand, that if you
understand that God is all-powerful -

109
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,842
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can
move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

110
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:41,160
It doesn't mean that!

111
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:54,162
But it means He is all powerful.

112
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:58,263
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest
thing, and such things

113
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:03,626
which our brain, this mental side cannot
understand.

114
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:09,714
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

115
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,100
This is what God is.

116
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,946
He is the One who has created human beings.

117
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,170
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

118
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:23,626
If a potter creates a pot that means
he is beyond the pot.

119
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:27,357
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

120
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:33,053
And the potter has created the pot,
so that means that this pot

121
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:38,193
which is created by him has to be -
something which is made by him,

122
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:43,757
so he has to be much more powerful
than the pot is.

123
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,877
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond
the conception of human beings,

124
00:10:53,078 --> 00:11:02,824
that what a God it must be Who has made
this great computer.

125
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,395
We take everything for granted.

126
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:13,510
We cannot even make a particle of clay
ourself.

127
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:17,230
We cannot make anything, human beings
cannot make.

128
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:20,454
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you
can put this up.

129
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:25,428
If there is some clay, you can make some
sort of a house out of it.

130
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,019
But it’s all dead from the dead.

131
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:43,312
But can you make a candle which will
burn badhas?

132
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:54,782
You have seen it with your own eyes that
before My photograph the badhas burn.

133
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:58,049
Can you do that?

134
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,202
Now you, we have no, also the idea
of the complete, intricate working,

135
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:18,695
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic
explosive machinery,

136
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:24,370
how it works to create human beings,
to create all this universe,

137
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:31,702
to create all these beautiful flowers and
trees and everything.

138
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:36,671
Look at the stars. Look at how many
they are.

139
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:41,849
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

140
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,465
How He has made it?

141
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:56,636
When He wants to send His own Son, He
can send it the way He wants to send it.

142
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:10,271
Even to challenge this shows the mental
mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

143
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:19,063
So to accept it is only possible

144
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:23,221
when you have saints, real saints who
tell you,

145
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:29,917
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born
out of Gauri.

146
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:38,417
But to jump into it, into faith,

147
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:44,741
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start
seeing miracles taking place.

148
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,119
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place

149
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,404
and if there is another miracle that has to
take place it will take place in any case.

150
00:13:56,605 --> 00:14:01,077
 We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

151
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:08,247
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt
you become again the same

152
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,736
human being which is just embedded
in the mud.

153
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,009
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

154
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,914
You are not flying in the air. Your roots
are down there.

155
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:31,425
But you are now lotuses,

156
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:38,836
and that's what is on top of the lotus,
this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

157
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:45,543
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which
came on this earth

158
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:56,842
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary,
as Mother Mary.

159
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,997
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out
of the sea.

160
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:09,969
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means,
you know, Marine means "the sea".

161
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,418
She was born out of the sea.

162
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:21,282
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She
could create a child. What's the harm?

163
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:27,276
She could do anything,

164
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,191
and this is the thing you have to rise
above.

165
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:37,328
Christians have to rise above this
Christianity,

166
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,522
and has to understand that it's such
a great thing that was Christ

167
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:48,240
Who came on this earth, Who was the
Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

168
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,365
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is
a very big thing

169
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:54,642
which one should try to understand.

170
00:15:54,843 --> 00:16:01,719
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

171
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:14,549
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first
created before creating anything,

172
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:22,610
any atmosphere, anything, because He is
the Omkara,

173
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:28,843
and the Omkara is the first breaking
of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

174
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:33,952
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.
From there started Omkara

175
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:39,205
and He is the One Who is the embodiment
of that Omkara.

176
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:43,238
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

177
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:51,743
was created first foremost thing, just
to create holiness, pavitrata.

178
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,189
When this holiness was created, this
pavitrata was created,

179
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:03,253
then everything was created in the sea
of that holiness.

180
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:12,572
And then He incarnated as Christ, but
as Mahavishnu,

181
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:18,271
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

182
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:26,191
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle
of Shri Ganesh.

183
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:34,151
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

184
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:41,046
So the, it was brought up, we should say,
by Mahavishnu, we can say,

185
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:47,893
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

186
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,194
In the Kundalini chart you can see that
the Shri Ganesha

187
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:56,300
is connected on the left-hand side
to the Ida Nadi,

188
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,748
and the Kundalini is above that.

189
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:11,013
So now what has happened is this, that
He transcended that part,

190
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,914
and if He had to come for the redemption,

191
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:19,181
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

192
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,766
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

193
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:30,633
or we should say, really conceived Him
within Himself as Christ,

194
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,445
and He became Mahavishnu.

195
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:45,164
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

196
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:52,713
It is beyond human mind to understand
how these things

197
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:59,547
are working out in that realm. Very
difficult.

198
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:03,790
But now you have got Realization, you can
feel in the cool breeze,

199
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:08,363
so many new things are happening to you.
So now believe Me,

200
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:13,536
that there is no unholy alliances

201
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,682
among the Gods and Goddesses, no
unholy alliances.

202
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:21,643
There is nothing that is human in them.

203
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:28,101
They are all divine, pure people.

204
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:33,519
Once you understand this point, then
you will understand

205
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:43,858
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be
a Son of Mahalakshmi,

206
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,398
was born to Him as Christ.

207
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:56,158
Because He had to come on Agnya,
and for the redemption,

208
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,936
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption
part,

209
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:10,401
because at that stage He is for
the innocence, for the holiness,

210
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:17,740
for the wisdom or also for destroying
a negativity.

211
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:23,722
But He had to come up; only He,

212
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:34,109
only Ganesha could be brought to this
very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

213
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:38,046
Now why is it constricted? It's quite
a scientific thing

214
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,898
which I would not like to discuss today.

215
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,571
But it had to be constricted

216
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:47,099
and it goes on getting more constricted,
this Agnya chakra,

217
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:54,615
the more, the more we think, the more
we go into the left or right,

218
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:59,365
it goes on really becoming like this,
absolutely like this.

219
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:07,443
So in this very subtle area only Christ
could be settled,

220
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:11,782
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:18,351
He's even subtler than an atom, because
in the atom

222
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:23,134
those vibrations which move asymmetric
and symmetric movements

223
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:28,218
are subtler than the atom.

224
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:31,635
And this is the subtler of that also.

225
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:36,886
So in that little very constricted area,

226
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:46,706
only a personality like Christ, which is
nothing but purity.

227
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:59,380
There is no other element in Him
but purity.

228
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:08,598
All other Incarnations have all the five
elements in it.

229
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,396
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure
vibrations.

230
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:19,322
That's why He could walk on the water,

231
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:27,525
because there was no mass in His body,
no matter in His body. No matter.

232
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:33,051
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

233
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:38,643
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

234
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:44,282
or the what you can say, the thing that
came out of Her body.

235
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:49,080
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage
we can say

236
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:53,971
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

237
00:22:54,172 --> 00:23:00,834
but in the state of Christ it was no
longer there.

238
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:09,691
But the whole drama was played later on,
of His death and resurrection,

239
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,942
because He is the One who is responsible
for our resurrection,

240
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:19,482
because He is the Gate. He is the Path
because He is Shri Ganesh.

241
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:25,885
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate,
but He is not the destination.

242
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:32,542
His Mother is the destination.

243
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:39,453
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

244
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:45,143
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination
where you have to reach.

245
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,283
All these things were never told
in the Bible

246
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:56,059
because He could hardly live for four
years with public life.

247
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,857
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know.

248
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:07,688
Also there was a definite suppression
of all Divine things,

249
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:12,528
for these people are all commercialized
institutions,

250
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:16,676
as we have also in India all kinds
of commercial institutions.

251
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:22,308
But the only advantage in India is that
religion is not organized.

252
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,127
Thank God for that!

253
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,712
But they organized it, they organized
Christ,

254
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:30,670
they organized all His principles,
everything,

255
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:34,354
and now they think He was a good human
being.

256
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:37,707
What a certificate to give!

257
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:45,316
So today we are here to celebrate
the birth of Omkara.

258
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:50,613
It's a very big thing. I don't know
if you can realize it, what it is,

259
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:58,231
which moves into everything, whether it is
anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

260
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:05,702
into all the organizing of chemicals and
also the periodic laws,

261
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:15,060
and also in the gravity, into everything
that moves is this Omkara,

262
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:20,370
and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

263
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:25,747
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:30,429
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

265
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:35,919
How is it happening, these lights look
like Omkara?

266
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,477
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis,

267
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:43,496
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads -
there is Omkara?

268
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:52,579
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name
also, in Arabic?

269
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,687
Who is doing this?

270
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:04,279
It is He who is doing all those things.

271
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:13,785
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

272
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:21,483
He is the One who is handling all these
powers.

273
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:28,291
He doesn't enter into the photograph,
no, He does not,

274
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:32,153
but He plays a trick.

275
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:38,397
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

276
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:43,972
Through the light. The light passes
straight, in a straight line.

277
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:48,712
But if He wants, He can make the light
pass another way round.

278
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:52,472
He can just transform the light into
something else.

279
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:55,763
He can do whatever He likes.

280
00:26:55,964 --> 00:27:00,140
And that's what He does to convince you.

281
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:03,549
And He said that "Anything against Me
I'll tolerate,

282
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,310
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

283
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:11,869
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

284
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:20,654
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

285
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:24,102
So the in the whole play He is like
the sutra dhara,

286
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:28,100
He is the One who is the conductor,

287
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:34,868
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

288
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,930
And so it is very important to pray
to Shri Ganesha,

289
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,987
every time we have Puja, we have
to pray to Him

290
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:47,685
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord
Jesus Christ. Every time.

291
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:53,249
Without His auspiciousness, without His
help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

292
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:00,008
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting
here and He is the manager.

293
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:04,140
Supposing there is no management, how
will I speak here?

294
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:07,569
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

295
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,720
and you never see Him working out
everything, doing everything.

296
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:18,096
You all would not have understood everything I said in English.

297
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,837
And today is Jesus Christ’s birthday.

298
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:28,399
Jesus Christ, what a great personality He is, that’s what I was telling them.

299
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:34,303
We people pray to Shri Ganesha, worship Him, because others told us to do so.

300
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,134
But what is He? What is Shri Ganesha?

301
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,540
We say that He is Omkara. What is Omkara?

302
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:48,501
All the functions of this whole universe, takes place due to the power of this Omkara,

303
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:52,366
which we call as “chaitanya”, call as “Bramha chaitanya”.

304
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:57,456
The concrete form of Brahma chaitanya is Omkara,

305
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,582
and the idol form of that,

306
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:02,862
or the iconic form of that, is Shri Ganesha.

307
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,540
And the incarnation of that (Brahma chaiytnya)

308
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,072
is Jesus Christ.

309
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:13,407
If you understand this point,

310
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:18,052
so, when we worship Shri Ganesha, like mad people we keep singing.

311
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,357
In each and every word of what we are saying,

312
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,511
We are describing His powers.

313
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:28,639
Why are we doing this?

314
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,295
Whoever has powers, supposing I have some powers, and you have some powers,

315
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:36,051
then what is the need to describe them?

316
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:39,495
So that we also achieve those powers,

317
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:42,702
and with those powers we also become powerful,

318
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:45,170
That is why we worship Shri Ganesha.

319
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:48,568
The greatest of his powers is sacredness.

320
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,191
Anything that is sacred is most powerful..

321
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,361
Nobody can touch it.

322
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:57,710
For example take a soap.
You wash it as many times you want

323
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,500
or wash it with anything, it doesn’t get dirty.

324
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:04,432
At times soap also may get dirty,

325
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:07,689
but this Omkar is holy, clean,

326
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:13,322
and eternal being,

327
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:18,560
or it is a power, which can work endlessly.

328
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:24,115
When you worship this power, you should remember,

329
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:28,178
that, we want to absorb this power within us,

330
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,477
so that, we become pure from within and all our chakras get cleared.

331
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:34,639
Our lives become pure and our society,

332
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,744
our political field, our country, and the whole world get purified.

333
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:44,784
And in that purity lies the joy.

334
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:47,010
When something becomes very clean,

335
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,323
for example when you have a bath and you wear a clean dress,

336
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,940
then you feel very nice.

337
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,801
But, when your whole life,

338
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:58,192
gets purified by this Omkar,

339
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,771
then

340
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,323
 we call it as “Atmanand”, (joy of spirit) we get that, achieve that.

341
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
And in the atma (spirit) also,

342
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,647
the prevailing power is that of “Omkara” only.

343
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:18,302
But we do not understand what Omkara is.

344
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:23,773
We just say it is something like “ardha matra” (half a syllable).

345
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:28,040
By saying this we don’t understand what exactly it is.

346
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:35,480
And when this four powers,”chatvari”, which is Ganesha’s powers,

347
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,288
We see the advent of the same in the life of Jesus Christ

348
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:45,983
But He was alive only for four years.

349
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:53,888
And somehow, about Him, there has been very less knowledge.

350
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:57,823
But in western countries, people started following Him.

351
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:01,760
Now these people have only brain and nothing else.

352
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:04,799
They have no heart but have only brain.

353
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,655
So in that brain,

354
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,000
how can such a subtle thing enter?

355
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,559
To understand this subtle thing

356
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,816
in the mind of human being,

357
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,609
the intellect should awaken, meaning,

358
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:29,007
within him that sensitive power should generate,

359
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:38,145
by which he gets filled, with luminary.

360
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:40,173
Gets flooded with light.

361
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,896
In that light, You can see that,

362
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:47,300
when this light is falling on the eyes, how dazzling it is.

363
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:50,343
But the light that comes from within,

364
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:54,391
doesn’t blur your eyes, but in that light everything is visible.

365
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:58,600
To achieve that enlightenment of the spirit,

366
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:02,910
You see the agnya chakra, this chakra is exactly above the “Medha” (brain).

367
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,334
This is Medha,

368
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:07,880
which is known as brain plate, agnya chakra is on this.

369
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,760
When Medha opens,

370
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,863
meaning Medha is like this “closed”.

371
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,976
When it opens, that is when we say agnya chakra has opened.

372
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:21,407
And when kundalini comes up from inside this,

373
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:25,663
and when it covers the upper part of Medha,

374
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,980
then in the intellect of human being

375
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,436
a distinct quality,

376
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,876
which is beyond human being,

377
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,532
beyond the intelligence of human,

378
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:45,470
a distinctive divine power, gets awakened.

379
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:48,079
And with this divine power

380
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:53,479
you start understanding what is truth and what is untruth.

381
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,387
You feel the same power in your hands also.

382
00:33:57,706 --> 00:34:00,875
Gradually, you don’t even have to check your hands for anything,

383
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:03,216
you will know it just like that.

384
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:06,347
You will at once understand this is wrong, this is right.

385
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:10,334
But some people start understanding this very soon,

386
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,701
I say that such people have been blessed by Jesus Christ.

387
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:18,431
And some people get stuck in the vortex of mind

388
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:21,849
For example, unnecessarily getting trapped in religion,

389
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,507
Getting stuck in caste and creed,

390
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,056
and thinking that “I like Indians only” or “I like English only”.

391
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:32,459
These kind of thoughts, and narrow mindedness and also conservatism,

392
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,337
And miserliness and such things around the world, In our country (India),

393
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:40,803
many kind of parasites, mosquitoes, bugs are available (who live on other’s money)

394
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,110
Which are not available anywhere else.

395
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:47,505
Whatever is available here, is not available anywhere else.

396
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:51,987
A human, how far and how deep, can fall into a pit,

397
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:55,198
is seen only in this country. Sometimes it is very surprising,

398
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,176
that in the country where great incarnations took birth,

399
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,212
the culture of which is full of devotion,

400
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:07,222
where Lord is worshipped, in such a place, by this kind of filth,

401
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:11,048
and this kind of conservative attitude,

402
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:15,051
we are decaying ourselves and continuing do so.

403
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:18,095
At least after coming to Sahaja Yoga we should leave them.

404
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:22,021
But even now this caste creed, this, that, and every other thing

405
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:25,200
is still making us like a vermin.

406
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:30,120
So this “Vishwa Nirmal Dharma”, this religion

407
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,977
is that of “Omkara”,
is that of holiness.

408
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:37,079
In this religion if all these attitude is going to be with you,

409
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,071
then you can not get into this religion,
And externally whatever you may say,

410
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:46,280
that “we worship Mataji, we use Her photo, and we follow Her,

411
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,776
So by that neither you are going to gain anything,

412
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,218
nor the world is going to benefit anything.

413
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,210
It is something like a lamp says

414
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:01,807
” yes sir, I have light, so I am giving light to everyone”.

415
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:05,223
then others will say ” show, where is your light”?

416
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:08,520
We are deceiving ourselves.

417
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:12,799
So whoever is in Sahaja Yoga, first they should completely convince themselves,

418
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,521
that now we are not going to deceive ourselves.

419
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:19,920
“We are going to leave this completely and get deeper into Sahaja Yoga”.

420
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,938
Only then you will benefit out of this.

421
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:27,803
Now I have noticed what happens to this, half baked people.

422
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:35,465
It is possible that because of going to some Guru you may have problems.

423
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:40,115
Or because of the wrong company also you may have problems.

424
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:47,399
Because today we are in that Era, which we call as kruti Yuga,

425
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,920
where in this brahma chaitanya (vibrations) will become active. This will work.

426
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:53,887
Now you,

427
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:59,113
can neither deceive yourself nor you can cheat Me.

428
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:04,418
Whoever adopts the path of deception, will bear the consequences.

429
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:09,376
One gentleman came and told Me

430
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:12,845
“mother, when I am meditating my face becomes this big”.

431
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,555
I said ” is that so”?

432
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,635
“how does it look like”?
“Like Hanumana” he said.

433
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,395
I said good, “you have become Hanumana”.

434
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:23,596
He said “no mother, I feel agitated, that my face is going to burst”

435
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:25,693
“You chew tobacco, right”?

436
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:27,384
“Yes, That is right”.

437
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:30,486
I said, ”if chew tobacco, why do you meditate”?

438
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:34,614
“You want to chew tobacco and meditate as well”?

439
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:37,080
Then the face will obviously bloat.

440
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:44,911
Another gentleman came, and said ”look Mother, my this finger is cut”.

441
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,574
“alright, were you smoking”?

442
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,467
he said “Yes”.
“so this finger of mine hurt”.

443
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,825
 gentleman met with a car accident.

444
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,086
He came and told that “Mother, only this finger is gone”.

445
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:59,731
“only this is hurt (index finger) because I smoke”.

446
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,215
You come to Sahaja Yoga and still smoke and consume liquor.

447
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,430
And you do all other things,

448
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,964
you claim to be a Sahaja Yogi,
roaming around with a big badge.

449
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:15,160
The same badge which you are wearing,
is going to break your head, let me warn you.

450
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:19,390
If you think that it is a simple thing to wear a badge, then it is not so.

451
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,136
The badge which you are wearing

452
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:25,391
 will break your head,
which I don’t want, I am not going to break.

453
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:29,440
Do you understand that this badge is not an ordinary thing.

454
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:34,050
It has a coefficient.
Meaning, vibrations flow out of it.

455
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:37,557
The same vibrations, if encircles your throat and strangles you,

456
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:40,007
then you will say, “Mother, I was sleeping with the badge on,

457
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,265
then how did this happen to me?

458
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:46,156
The badge you were wearing, came out and broke your scull.

459
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,503
So don’t put on the badge.

460
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:50,955
But if you want to use it, then be worthy of it.

461
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:56,252
Now-a-days everyone says ”Mother, give one badge,

462
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:58,791
we want to put it around the neck as locket.

463
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:01,494
You wear it but with caution, do you get it?

464
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:05,807
Don’t blame me later that,”

465
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:10,480
Mother, I wore this and went,
still I slipped and my leg broke“.

466
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:13,726
That badge only made you slip, so don’t wear it.

467
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,159
If you want to wear it,

468
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,145
then you should have the eligibility and worthiness for it.

469
00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:22,230
If you are not eligible to wear this,

470
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:25,440
then God save you from Jesus Christ.

471
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,439
And Shri Ganesha is one step above Him.

472
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,968
He has the axe (parasu) in His left hand,

473
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,212
If He hits, then what can I do?

474
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,476
As for He is concerned He doesn’t listen to me, ow that you have worn it,

475
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:40,664
then He says
“now wear and face the consequence”.

476
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,483
So to wear this badge

477
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:44,983
or, to

478
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:48,509
wear the pendent, to wear the ring,

479
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:51,720
Oh my God! you have to be very careful.

480
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:55,093
When you go to washroom, remove them

481
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,113
and keep carefully.

482
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,080
About My hairs also I have told people to oblige.

483
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:05,920
These hairs have been given by “Yama” (God of death).

484
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,870
He is always behind them.

485
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,717
So, please, if you see them lying anywhere,

486
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:13,035
be kind enough to return them to Me.

487
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:17,150
I don’t want you to face any problem, because I am a mother also.

488
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,826
But these people (deities) are not your mother or father.

489
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,352
They are your brothers.

490
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,762
They go behind you with a stick.

491
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:32,400
So understand that you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

492
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:36,200
“Oh! it is so joy giving with bhajan and all”

493
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,436
Then how did you get the blow?

494
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:43,175
So that’s why,

495
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:46,462
the specialty of Sahaja Yoga should be understood

496
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:49,149
thus that this is the knowledge of the supreme God.

497
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,848
The supreme God
is not a Mother.

498
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,389
Mother is all affectionate.

499
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,854
She understands that these are my children,

500
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:02,955
at times they do this and do that, it’s alright.

501
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:05,520
But,

502
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,098
The supreme God is watching,

503
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:13,072
how you all are behaving?

504
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,471
After a lot of hard work, We,
that is your Mother gave you all Sahaja Yoga,

505
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:25,161
And where is your foot wobbling?

506
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,190
What mistake are you doing now?

507
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:33,600
And so you should act with understanding.

508
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:39,639
But, I would say that, Adishakti is definitely
the power of the God almighty,

509
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,054
She is His desire.

510
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:45,402
But, The God almighty, is watching,

511
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,610
that all the hard work that is happening,

512
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:51,181
and in the drama created by Her,

513
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:54,156
how many are truthful and untruthful.

514
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:58,238
And He is calculating, who all should be taken to task.

515
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:02,046
Whoever is good, also should be
considered sometimes, right?

516
00:42:02,247 --> 00:42:03,524
It’s not like that.

517
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,576
But whoever is insincere,
He will catch them.

518
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:09,862
And He will give everybody a blow.

519
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:11,673
That is why, kindly,

520
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:14,303
do whatever you have to,

521
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:18,279
with a clean heart,
with a open heart.

522
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:21,587
I have not told you before that if you have other interests within,

523
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:24,849
if you have blind faith, if you have casteism within you,

524
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,447
Or if you have “we Indians are great” kind of feeling within you,

525
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:31,403
These kind of feelings are myth, it has no purity,

526
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:35,461
You kindly get rid of all these feelings, and then wear my pendent.

527
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:39,084
Because with each pendent one “Gana” is appointed.

528
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,382
And they (ganas) are around you.

529
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,496
They always protect you,

530
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:49,199
in a way they protect you to stop you from doing wrong things.

531
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,217
Because, they know you in and out.

532
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:02,335
So, today this warning also was very essential for you all.

533
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:06,080
And also, it is a very happy occasion

534
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:11,993
that if, In this world, Jesus Christ had not come,

535
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:16,101
and if he had not made us sit on his Agnya Chakra,

536
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,133
and opened the path of rebirth,

537
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,052
path of resurrection, then Sahaja Yoga wouldn’t have been possible.

538
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,460
 It was very essential that He took birth.

539
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:30,781
But there is no fight among themselves.
All of them (incarnations) are,

540
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:33,310
born on one single tree,

541
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:36,286
on a living tree they all were created

542
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:39,384
and this tree was flourished finally I came on Sahasrara,

543
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:42,960
and this work (Sahaja Yoga) happened in Sahasrara.

544
00:43:44,547 --> 00:43:47,468
If tree is not there, how can Sahasrara be there?

545
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:52,508
And if the Sahasrara is there, then this tree only has created that Sahasrara.

546
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:57,394
 So, it is the responsibility of the tree also to take care of the Sahasrara,

547
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:03,575
and protect it completely, and punish those who go against it (Sahasrara).

548
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:10,800
So, for all of you, today is in a very special sense,

549
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:14,613
is of importance, that if Jesus Christ had not come,

550
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:17,750
then, our resurrection wouldn’t have happened.

551
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:22,782
Because, we tell Shri Ganesha that when our time for moksha comes,

552
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,760
you please protect us.

553
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:26,463
(inaudible)

554
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:32,873
At the time of moksha He Himself (Ganesh) appears,

555
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,481
on the agnya chakra and gives you protection.

556
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:42,840
So Today’s day is very auspicious for all of us,

557
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:46,440
very joy giving day also,

558
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:50,573
and at the same time cautions us also, that “Be careful”.

559
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:53,789
And if you get stuck in “agnya chakra”,

560
00:44:54,218 --> 00:44:56,823
then you will end up either in a mental asylum,

561
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:03,038
or you will get some other disease.

562
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,896
The sanctity of agnya chakra should be maintained, meaning our thoughts should be pure.

563
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:12,555
If impure thoughts come, then we should keep forgiving them.

564
00:45:13,073 --> 00:45:14,998
Thoughts should always be pure.

565
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,359
And as you start ascending, you will not get impure thoughts,

566
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,560
only pure thoughts will come.

567
00:45:22,255 --> 00:45:27,360
This Sahaja Yoga is made only for your joy,

568
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:30,495
for your greatness,

569
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:32,391
for your dignity,

570
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:36,577
and for your over all progress.

571
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:41,721
But along with that this fact also is contained,

572
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:46,704
that for this great work,

573
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,518
and for the people who are completely attached with this work,

574
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:56,663
if one does not co-operate and provide their full support,

575
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,929
also may land up into deep trouble.

576
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:04,006
Those who are doing this work wholeheartedly,

577
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:07,262
you should support them wholeheartedly.

578
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:11,129
In many people now I am noticing the disease of miserliness.

579
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,513
For example,

580
00:46:13,974 --> 00:46:19,097
“if 4 rupees can be saved, it is okay, let me save it”.

581
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,263
If you try to save 4 rupees, you will lose at least 400 rupees,

582
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:25,718
just like that.

583
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:31,576
And your 1 rupee given to Sahaja Yoga, can be equal to 1 lac rupees.

584
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:34,918
Meaning, one rupee will be enough, that’s what I am telling you.

585
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:38,247
But we are not giving anything, everything belongs to Mother,

586
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:40,159
we are giving Mother, what is Hers.

587
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:43,453
And, I don’t take anything, you know that I am trying to resist every day

588
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:45,128
 that don’t give me presents,

589
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:47,750
I don’t want anything, don’t give Me sarees,

590
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:50,622
From morning to evening, since 5 years the tussle is going on,

591
00:46:50,823 --> 00:46:53,852
no one listens, I have been asking them to reduce buying gifts,

592
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:57,606
Now the prices also are increasing, and I don’t need anything.

593
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:01,246
But for Sahaja Yoga money is required.

594
00:47:01,928 --> 00:47:06,818
But there are people here, who feel that eat food for free is right.

595
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:14,285
Later if they have stomach problem, I am not responsible for that.

596
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:21,960
And this place is not for beggars.

597
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:25,660
This is for people who are wealthy by demeanor.

598
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:28,201
If you have the mentality of a king, then come here.

599
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:30,799
There is no need that you should have money.

600
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,466
Many rich people are extremely stingy,

601
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,678
and so peculiar that it is difficult to understand them,

602
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:39,095
And many poor people are like Me,

603
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:42,454
that they find joy in just giving to others.

604
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,836
When your one hand opens you take from it.

605
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:48,570
But only when the other hand opens, you will get from that hand,

606
00:47:48,771 --> 00:47:50,636
otherwise it will stop there.

607
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:56,166
But when I hear about miserliness, I feel very disgusted you cannot imagine.

608
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:02,742
But, I liked the other day’s scene, when there was nothing to give,

609
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:05,550
people accepted my photo with affection.

610
00:48:05,751 --> 00:48:09,440
“Mother, please give us your photo this time, we will feel good”.

611
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:11,040
Satisfaction,

612
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:14,606
should come first.

613
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:19,680
After the satisfaction human being, nobody can sacrifice like Jesus Christ, right?

614
00:48:20,046 --> 00:48:23,760
But, that sacrifice should be gladly accepted.

615
00:48:24,141 --> 00:48:26,771
It can be difficult, but it doesn’t matter.

616
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,327
But we all doing a very great job.

617
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:32,920
And not just for us, we are doing it for all others.

618
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,746
Next year I am going to get your name list.

619
00:48:37,947 --> 00:48:41,006
and I want to see, specially, about the complain on Bombay people,

620
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:44,320
that, they completely refuse to pay money.

621
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,050
And the Mahalakshmi temple is in this Bombay.

622
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,586
What is the use of that poor Mahalakshmi and the temple?

623
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:54,355
Where Mahalakshmi Herself came out of the earth,

624
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:59,345
and in such a place people are so stingy that, they do not want to pay at all,

625
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:04,508
thinking that Mother is doing everything, so come, let us just relax and enjoy.

626
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:08,480
As such everything will happen whether they pay or not,

627
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:11,303
But what will happen to them,

628
00:49:11,835 --> 00:49:13,200
think of that.

629
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,349
The quality of Mahalakshmi principle is that, when we become a contented personality,

630
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,819
when the Lakshmi principle attains maturity, the Mahalakshmi principle gets awakened,

631
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,362
and we start searching the truth.

632
00:49:30,024 --> 00:49:32,320
If there is no contentment within you,

633
00:49:32,995 --> 00:49:35,560
you cannot attain the Mahalakshmi principle

634
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:42,158
Look at Seeta Ji’s life, how long did she stay with Ramchandra Ji?

635
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:43,837
Radha Ji’s life,

636
00:49:44,037 --> 00:49:47,896
And after that Shri Jesus Christ’s Mother’s life?

637
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:52,280
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

638
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,764
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

639
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:59,236
So with the Mahalakshmi principle human becomes contented,

640
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:00,477
and

641
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:05,377
with this principle he seeks the truth,

642
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:09,600
And during this seeking, he leaves behind the untruth.

643
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:13,382
In today’s Mahalakshmi Puja,

644
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:18,904
Where in we are worshipping Jesus Christ, and His mother Mary

645
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,000
then we should get into total contentment.

646
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:29,800
When we get satisfied with materialistic things and worldly things,

647
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:34,046
only then the Mahalakshmi principle awakens within us.

648
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,440
And then, the Mahalakshmi Principle manages the Lakshmi principle.

649
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:45,400
And Lakshmi Principle starts manifesting by itself,

650
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,080
gets implemented by itself and gives the benefit automatically.

651
00:50:50,397 --> 00:50:53,680
Automatically everything constructive happens.

652
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:06,368
So, I just have to tell you that expand your heart.

653
00:51:07,075 --> 00:51:08,440
Be generous.

654
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:11,960
And establish that Omkara within your heart,

655
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:16,470
establish that essence of the spirit, establish that Jesus Christ and the Ganesha within you,

656
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:18,397
because of whom,

657
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:24,551
all our undone work will be done,

658
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:27,560
and you can have authority over me.

659
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,535
Without them I can not give you any right.

660
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:38,800
In the raising of Kundalini also, until, from the mooladhar

661
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:48,096
 the permission doesn’t come, unless the Ganesha, present in mooladhar says: ” Yes”,

662
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:52,526
 not only Me, but no one can raise the Kundalini.

663
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:56,760
These are His reserved rights.

664
00:51:58,355 --> 00:52:01,269
If anybody thinks that He is very close to mother,

665
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,493
then they should understand that even if He is close,

666
00:52:04,694 --> 00:52:11,191
and in real He is close to mother then that is happening with Shri Ganesha’s consent,

667
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:13,397
Jesus Christ’s consent.

668
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:18,280
Without their consent, I can not accept anyone.

669
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,610
This is a bondage upon us,

670
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:25,200
that’s why I tell you again and again that “be careful”.

671
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:28,200
Their bondage has to be accepted.

672
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:33,840
And whatever is their opinion about you,

673
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:36,440
whatever they think about you,

674
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:39,040
I have to take into consideration.

675
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:43,501
How ever hard I may forgive, from a mother’s point of view whatever I may say,

676
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,867
But I am lost in front of these deities (Jesus and Ganesha).

677
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:51,880
And You should know that, “They” are there to help you, to cleanse you,

678
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:54,013
and do everything for you,

679
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:57,942
But “They” have one expectation from you, I have no expectations, I am without expectations,

680
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:01,351
I don’t want anything from you, however you are it is fine.

681
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:07,522
But, “They” have expectations that, if you say or do anything against Me,

682
00:53:08,035 --> 00:53:11,282
or if you do any kind of “pettiness” in Sahaja Yoga,

683
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:15,999
or you do any kind of cheating or any such thing, then “They” will be behind you.

684
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,294
  That’s why I am telling you again and again, on this day,

685
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,774
on this auspicious occasion, we should realize,

686
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:24,037
 that, such great powers are standing by our side.

687
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:28,640
And why shouldn’t we accept these powers and live like an emperor?

688
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,687
And why should we be “Petty minded”, when we have such a big throne,

689
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:35,179
then let us sit on the throne with dignity.

690
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,486
And let us live with that dignity, as we are supposed to.

691
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,437
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis, you are saints,

692
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,206
it is a very great thing, when were there so many Yogis?

693
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:47,800
And so many saints have come to “Ganapatipule”,

694
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:51,294
where in Maha Ganesha is sitting, He is called Maha Ganesha.

695
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,198
And in the Maha Ganesha’s

696
00:53:57,104 --> 00:53:59,143
family, we all have joined.

697
00:53:59,493 --> 00:54:01,960
We have come to His forum.

698
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:08,462
And with His blessings, within us also, great powers as He has, can manifest.

699
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:13,400
But first of all, to withstand that power, His purity should be established.

700
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:16,541
and there should be a devotion (bhakti) towards him.

701
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:22,441
The bhakti should be in such a way that, there is no selfishness of any kind in that.

702
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:24,275
There is only Bhakti.

703
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:28,202
If we can ready ourselves like Him, then He takes care of rest of the things.

704
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:30,590
Then He is at your disposal to manage you.

705
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:35,920
But if you go on the opposite side, He may also harm you.

706
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,031
just like that,

707
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,070
I want to make you understand something sensible.

708
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:49,760
Because a mother always feels that, these children of mine are very sweet,

709
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:53,360
and you should only benefit from them (deities).

710
00:54:53,884 --> 00:54:58,240
Then I also feel that you should not feel sorry later.

711
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:01,800
 That is why, I am explaining to you,

712
00:55:02,157 --> 00:55:05,099
when we have created such beautiful atmosphere here,

713
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,566
and gathered like one family members,

714
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:11,477
and we all are together,

715
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:17,440
then these elder brothers of yours should be acknowledged by you,

716
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:21,520
that they are present and they should be recognized.

717
00:55:21,774 --> 00:55:26,217
And if you worship them and make them happy, it will be really good.

718
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:28,881
But they don’t get pleased so soon.

719
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:32,806
Until you are cleansed from within, they won’t be happy.

720
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:36,761
So you clean yourself from within, and take a vow today

721
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:41,009
that, in future we will completely discard all types of pettiness,

722
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,719
frivolous act, and trivial matters.

723
00:55:45,228 --> 00:55:48,806
And we shall look up to these deities’ greatness and purity

724
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:52,399
and consider them as our ideals and steer our lives in that direction.

725
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,400
If we do just this, it will be our benefit from all sides.

726
00:55:56,924 --> 00:55:58,892
My infinite blessings to you.

727
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:03,096
And you all have come here with lots of love,

728
00:56:06,224 --> 00:56:09,040
I can not say thanks to you all,

729
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:12,565
but it is just that my heart is deeply moved.

730
00:56:12,766 --> 00:56:15,425
and in this heart, you all are residing,

731
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:18,192
and I love you all too much.

732
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:22,080
and I look at you with immeasurable love.

733
00:56:22,342 --> 00:56:25,902
and my thoughts are always around your protection.

734
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:29,800
My total attention and thoughts are towards you

735
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:35,048
and for any kind of problem you can write to me,

736
00:56:35,278 --> 00:56:37,774
but you yourself should become pure,

737
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,240
you should become clean,

738
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:46,400
and you should become delightful and experience this joy till eternity.
