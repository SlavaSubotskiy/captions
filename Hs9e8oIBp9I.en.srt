1
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:20,888
Today we have such a great opportunity to
celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:26,558
He was born in a manger.

3
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,248
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:46,127
That He should be born in a manger in difficult
situations, to show that whether you are born

5
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:58,042
poor or rich, whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems, if you have Divinity within

6
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:03,775
you it shines by itself.

7
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:21,773
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated
line, they have never been able to understand

8
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:25,035
the significance of Christ.

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:34,869
To them immaculate conception is absolutely
not possible.

10
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:41,186
Most of the people think that it's some sort
of a mythical story.

11
00:01:41,186 --> 00:02:02,327
But in India we do believe that Gauri created
Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations and

12
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:07,437
that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

13
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:10,517
We accept it.

14
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:11,667
But not in the West.

15
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:19,537
They will never accept such a thing because
their mental side is over-developed and dominates

16
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:24,137
them.

17
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:35,776
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians
to understand that above all He is God.

18
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:40,157
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

19
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:51,757
Moreover, the way Christianity has been, it
has not provided any proper guidance.

20
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:59,467
On the contrary wherever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

21
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:06,817
But it's very simple to understand for Indians,
that anything is possible for God.

22
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:10,616
After all He is God.

23
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,657
He is God Almighty.

24
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:23,788
Because of this mental attitude which is much
lower than the knowledge of your spirit, the

25
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:34,416
ordinary, mundane type of the superficial
knowledge can never allow the personality

26
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,037
to accept the greatness of God.

27
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:42,187
I had a grandma.

28
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:53,517
She was My father's aunt and she used to tell
us a nice story about somebody who was going

29
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,517
to meet God.

30
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,496
Of course this - in India everybody understands
all these things.

31
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:01,017
They will not say: "How he is going to meet
God?" but they accept.

32
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,006
All right, he is going to meet God.

33
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:10,067
So when he was going on the way, on the road,
he found one gentleman sitting there nicely

34
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:18,367
singing songs, bhajans of God, doing nothing
on the roadside.

35
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,297
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet
God?"

36
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:24,087
"Yes, I am going to meet Him.

37
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,647
So have you any message for Him?"

38
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:33,077
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,
but He should arrange for my food, because

39
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:34,537
I think the food is now finishing."

40
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:40,626
He said: "Really, that's what you want me
to tell Him?"

41
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:43,677
"Yes, yes, please tell Him.

42
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:49,387
Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell
Him."

43
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:56,500
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian

44
00:04:56,554 --> 00:05:00,964
way I would say he was going to church every
day with nice suits, and singing hymns every

45
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,150
day, listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say; and in the Indian way

46
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:10,661
we can say he was going to the temple every
day, standing on his head, doing all kinds

47
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,777
of yoga asanas and everything.

48
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:18,511
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've
tried everything.

49
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,612
When is He going to meet me?

50
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,992
I would like to see Him.

51
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,762
I would like to have His darshan."

52
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:24,971
He said: "All right."

53
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:38,792
So he went to God, and whatever work he had
he finished with it, and then God asked him:

54
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,434
"Have you got anything to tell Me?"

55
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:48,744
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman
while coming and he said that 'I'm doing all

56
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:52,729
kinds of things, I have tried everything,
and when will God meet me?

57
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:58,083
I am standing on my head, and I am doing also
all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of

58
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:04,631
things, and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying, doing all sorts of prayers,

59
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,064
but when will God meet me?'"

60
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,127
So God said: "Tell him he has to do a little
more.

61
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,564
See, it's not easy.

62
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:27,399
When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

63
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,195
So then even he said: "And there is another
one who was on the road, You see.

64
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,930
As he was just enjoying himself singing songs,
he suddenly saw me, and he told me: 'You see,

65
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,890
my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange
it for me.'"

66
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,226
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?"

67
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,451
Immediately God said: "What are you doing,
why don't you go and look after him?

68
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,451
His food is finishing."

69
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,921
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged
it, all that."

70
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:54,231
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter."

71
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:58,421
You see, he couldn't understand, you know,
that this fellow who is trying all these things

72
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,830
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

73
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,491
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that, and why is it so much

74
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:15,521
impressed by this another fellow who is doing
nothing to seek God?

75
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:18,251
So then God realized that he is in some sort
of an illusion.

76
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:22,261
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

77
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:31,001
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there was that He

78
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:38,655
made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

79
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,800
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

80
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,891
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the
reaction."

81
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,891
So he went down.

82
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:50,060
So this is, the first one met him, he said:
"What God has said?"

83
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:54,291
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja
Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

84
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,020
Before that you'll go around like this."

85
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,460
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

86
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,013
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime.

87
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,284
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

88
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,822
And he was quite disappointed.

89
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,930
So he went.

90
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:15,401
And he asked him that: "What did you see with,
there when you went to see God?"

91
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:22,497
He said: "I saw that, you know, He passed
a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

92
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:23,986
He said: "What?

93
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,986
How is it possible?

94
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:26,986
It's impossible!"

95
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:27,986
(Now mental.)

96
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:32,946
"How is it possible, that a camel gets passed
through the eye, it's not possible, see the

97
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,877
volume of this one and such a little thing.

98
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:36,917
How can he pass?

99
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:41,757
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story
because you have been to God, you are trying

100
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:42,907
to show off, that's all.

101
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,837
I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

102
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:49,207
It's.. you are just telling me lies, and don't
try to befool me."

103
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:53,037
So he went to another person who was on the
street eating nicely.

104
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,637
He said: "How are you?"

105
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:58,627
"I know He had arranged before you reached
there, I know it was all right after all.

106
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:00,537
You see He looks after me all the time.

107
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,066
So what did you see when you went there?"

108
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:10,647
He said: "I saw that God Almighty passed a
camel through an eye of a needle.

109
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,706
It's a very amazing thing."

110
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:14,825
He said: "What, amazing?

111
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,580
He is God, do you know He is God?

112
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you know He is God?

113
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,594
God can do anything.

114
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:25,096
He can do anything!"

115
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:34,133
That's made him understand, that if you understand
that God is all-powerful, all-powerful, it

116
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:38,174
doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to
Maharashtra.

117
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:50,999
It doesn't mean that!

118
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,649
But it means He is all powerful.

119
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:01,249
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing,
and such things which our brain, this mental

120
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,558
side cannot understand.

121
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:08,589
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

122
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,719
This is what God is.

123
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,529
He's the One who has created human beings.

124
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,369
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

125
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,969
If a potter creates a pot that means he is
beyond the pot.

126
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:26,268
Pot cannot create God.. the potter.

127
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:35,489
And the potter has created the pot, so that
means that this pot which is created by him

128
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:41,409
has to be something which is made by him,
so he has to be much more powerful than the

129
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,699
pot is.

130
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:56,519
But it is unbelievable, or say beyond the
conception of human beings, that what a God

131
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:04,509
it must be Who has made this great computer.

132
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,939
We take everything for granted.

133
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:14,729
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

134
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:17,509
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot
make.

135
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,629
Ha, if there is some stone, all right you
can put this up.

136
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:25,869
If there is some clay you can make some sort
of a house out of it.

137
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,749
That's all dead from the dead.

138
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:41,949
But can you make a candle which will burn
badhas?

139
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:54,288
You have seen it with your own eyes that before
My photograph the badhas burn.

140
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:59,209
Can you do that?

141
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:14,278
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the
complete, intricate working, delicate machinery,

142
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:23,579
and also very dynamic explosive machinery,
how it works to create human beings, to create

143
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:30,279
all this universe, to create all these beautiful
flowers and trees and everything.

144
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,509
Look at the stars.

145
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,759
Look at how many they are.

146
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,329
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

147
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:47,569
How He has made it?

148
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:58,859
When He wants to send His own Son, He can
send it the way He wants to send it.

149
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:14,428
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind
which is in, absolutely in mud.

150
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:23,869
So to accept it is only possible when you
have saints, real saints who tell you, that

151
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:31,298
this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

152
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:43,029
But to jump into it, into faith, when you
come to Sahaja Yoga you start seeing miracles

153
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,369
taking place.

154
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:52,418
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place and if there is another miracle

155
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:56,138
that has to take place it will take place
in any case.

156
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:00,048
We are not doing anything, it is all done.

157
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,678
And we don't doubt it.

158
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:14,269
Once you doubt you become again the same human
being which is just embedded in the mud.

159
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:20,839
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

160
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,819
You are not flying in the air.

161
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,629
Your roots are down there.

162
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:36,449
But you are now lotuses, and that's what is
on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle

163
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:37,909
is born.

164
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:51,538
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came
on this earth as Sitaji, as Radha and also

165
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:57,548
as Mary, as Mother Mary.

166
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:02,079
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of
the sea.

167
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,869
What is the meaning of "Mary"?

168
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:09,949
Maria means, you know, Mare means "the sea".

169
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:15,009
She was born out of the sea.

170
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:21,149
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could
create a child.

171
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,239
What's the harm?

172
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:33,969
She could do anything, and this is the thing
you have to rise above.

173
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:40,689
Christians have to rise above this Christianity,
and has to understand that it's such a great

174
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:46,099
thing that was Christ Who came on this earth,
Who was the Incarnation of the principle of

175
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:49,199
Ganesha.

176
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,509
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big
thing which one should try to understand.

177
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:01,169
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

178
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:17,089
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created
before creating anything, any atmosphere,

179
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:27,199
anything, because He is the Omkara, and the
Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti

180
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,199
from Shiva.

181
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,329
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.

182
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:39,788
From there started Omkara and He is the One
Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

183
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:48,788
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,
was created first foremost thing, just to

184
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:52,298
create holiness [SOUNDS LIKE povitrada].

185
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:59,279
When this holiness was created, this [povitrada]
was created, then everything was created in

186
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,268
the sea of that holiness.

187
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:18,949
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu,
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

188
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,089
And who is Vishnu?

189
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:27,439
Is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

190
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,183
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

191
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:44,079
So He was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu,
we can say, but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle

192
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,889
of Shri Ganesh.

193
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:52,899
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the
Shri Ganesha is connected on the left hand

194
00:17:52,899 --> 00:18:04,299
side to the Ida Nadi, and the Kundalini is
above that.

195
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:12,759
So now what has happened is this, that He
transcended that part, and if He had to come

196
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,749
for the redemption, He had to come as the
Son of Mahalakshmi.

197
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:26,609
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him, or
we should say really, conceived Him within

198
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:37,229
Himself as Christ, and He became Mahavishnu.

199
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:45,629
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

200
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:57,139
It is beyond human mind to understand how
these things are working out in that realm.

201
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,989
Very difficult.

202
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:05,149
But now you have got Realization you can feel
in the cool breeze, so many new things are

203
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,539
happening to you.

204
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:15,519
So now believe Me, that there is no unholy
alliances among the Gods and Goddesses, no

205
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,579
unholy alliances.

206
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:21,889
There is nothing that is human in them.

207
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:26,659
They're all divine, pure people.

208
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:39,239
Once you understand this point then you will
understand why Shri Ganesha had to accept

209
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:49,138
to be a Son of Mahalakshmi, was born to Him
as Christ.

210
00:19:49,138 --> 00:20:01,029
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the
redemption as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption

211
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:11,459
part, because at that stage He is for the
innocence, for the holiness, for the wisdom

212
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:18,579
or also for destroying the negativity.

213
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:28,899
But He had to come up, only He, only Ganesha
could be brought to this very constricted

214
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:35,259
chakra, Agnya chakra.

215
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,709
Now why is it constricted?

216
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:40,150
It's quite a scientific thing which I would
not like to discuss today.

217
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:47,427
But it had to be constricted and it goes on
getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

218
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:56,129
the more, the more we think, the more we go
into the left or right, it goes on really

219
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,849
becoming like this, absolutely like this.

220
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:10,429
So in this very subtle area only Christ could
be subtle, because He's the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:21,389
He's even subtler than an atom, because in
the atom those vibrations which move asymmetric

222
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:26,399
and symmetric movements are subtler than the
atom.

223
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:32,169
And this is the subtler of that also.

224
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:43,769
So in that little very constricted area, only
a personality like Christ, which is nothing

225
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,919
but purity.

226
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:58,609
There is no other element in Him but purity.

227
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:09,069
All other Incarnations have all the five elements
in it.

228
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,069
He has nothing.

229
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:15,959
He is nothing but pure vibrations.

230
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:23,879
That's why He could walk on the water, because
there was no mass in His body, no matter in

231
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:24,879
His body.

232
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,729
No matter.

233
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:33,369
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

234
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:42,179
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud, or the
what you can say, the thing that came out

235
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,179
of Her body.

236
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,989
Only the Chaitanya.

237
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:54,949
So at Ganesha's stage we can say that the
Chaitanya was kept in that form, but in the

238
00:22:54,949 --> 00:23:01,989
state of Christ it was not there.

239
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:11,309
But the whole drama was played later on, of
His death and resurrection, because He is

240
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:17,619
the One who is responsible for our resurrection,
because He is the Gate.

241
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,809
He's the Path because He's Shri Ganesh.

242
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:29,279
Omkara is the Path, and He's the Gate, but
He is not the destination.

243
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,029
His Mother is the destination.

244
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:37,849
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.

245
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,099
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

246
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:46,979
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where
you have to reach.

247
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:52,819
All these things were never told in the Bible,
because He could hardly live for four years

248
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,061
with public life.

249
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:03,939
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know, also there was a definite

250
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:11,989
suppression of all Divine things, for these
people are all commercialized institutions,

251
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:16,369
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial
institutions.

252
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:22,129
But the only advantage in India is that religion
is not organized.

253
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,159
Thank God for that!

254
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:31,159
But they organized it, they organized Christ,
they organized all His principles, everything,

255
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,989
and now they think He was a good human being.

256
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:39,489
What a certificate to give Him!

257
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:44,909
So today we are here to celebrate the birth
of Omkara.

258
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,959
It's a very big thing.

259
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:53,639
I don't know if you can realize it, what it
is, which moves into everything, whether it

260
00:24:53,639 --> 00:25:03,119
is [SOUNDS LIKE anu, paramanu], is the atom,
molecules, into all the organizing of chemicals

261
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:14,269
and also the periodic laws, and also in the
gravity, into every thing that moves is this

262
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:18,659
Omkara, and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

263
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:25,339
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:31,309
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

265
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,369
How is it happening, these lights look like
Omkara?

266
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:42,049
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis, there's all the Sahaja Yogis' heads,

267
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:54,619
there is Omkara? - or Allah in Arabic language
- My name also, in Arabic.

268
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,269
Who is doing this?

269
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:05,499
It is He who is doing all this.

270
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:14,209
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

271
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:20,989
He's the One who is handling all these powers.

272
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:30,319
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no,
He does not, but He plays a trick.

273
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:37,819
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

274
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:38,849
Through the light.

275
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:43,139
The light passes straight, a straight line.

276
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:49,229
But if He wants He can make the light pass
another way round.

277
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:52,428
He can just transform the light into something
else.

278
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:55,579
He can do whatever He likes.

279
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,919
And that's what He does to convince you.

280
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:07,709
And He said that: "Anything against Me I'll
tolerate, but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

281
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:13,839
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

282
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:21,089
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

283
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:27,069
So that in the whole play He is like the [SOUNDS
LIKE sutra dhara], He's the One who is the

284
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:33,529
conductor, the One moves the strings in a
puppet show.

285
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:39,789
And so it is very important to pray to Shri
Ganesha every time we have Puja.

286
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:47,629
We have to pray to Him and we, that's how
we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ.

287
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:48,629
Every time.

288
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:53,979
Without His auspiciousness, without His help,
we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,449
He's the Manager.

290
00:27:55,449 --> 00:28:00,449
See I'm sitting here and He's the manager.

291
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:04,739
Supposing there's no management how will I
speak here?

292
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:05,999
Nothing can happen.

293
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:11,509
But He is so efficient, and you never see
Him working out everything, doing everything.
