1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,740
Welcome back

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,700
I guess Indian gurus have been involved over recent years in the West, when the Beatles introduced us to the Maharishi.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,870
The orange people blindly followed the bad one, but they have been others far more credible and far more respectful.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,500
My next guest is a Bombay lady

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,700
Who's following is growing around the world.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,400
She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from common to cancer.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,600
All you have to do is now have a tap... , tapping that power.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,000
Please welcome the lady acclaimed as India's greatest living Saint,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,040
the Mother of Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.
 Welcome.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,100
I know it's ...Welcome to Australia, I know it's very difficult for you, for anyone to sum up one's religion,

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,000
but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Sahaja- "saha" means "with"," ja" is "born with you".

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
This is born with you. Within us is the power

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,500
which can give us the status of a Spirit.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,230
We are not yet the Spirit.

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,000
We are at a human level .

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And in the evolutionary process we have to now have the breakthrough to become the Spirit.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,090
 That's very essential and is absolutely

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,000
eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,200
It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,200
All the religions have talked about it and told about it, but people have gone wrong in believing that

22
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,200
artificially if you say that you are baptized

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,500
or you have become a Brahmin or you have become a pire that you have become the Spirit.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,100
It's not that.
It's a happening that has to take place within ourselves

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:55,400
Which is a living process, absolutely a living process of living Divine force within ourselves.

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,200
How does this.. we have heard of lots of yogas,

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,210
How does this differ from other any yoga?

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,300
Other yoga's were practiced mostly after getting Realization.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,400
But as it has come from some half-baked people,

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,800
it is in a very funny way that people follow it as if they have to take all the medicines together.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
And they don't know any discrimination about it.

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,000
Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
what type of attention is needed

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,300
 and what type of physical exercise is needed.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,800
Indiscriminately people do physical exercises getting into trouble.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Now you are speaking of the force. Is it possible to say where this force emanate from?

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,000
This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,450
Sacrum

39
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,800
Now the sacrum is a word that comes from Greece

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,380
and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone.

41
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,570
It rises from there, passes through our six centers

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:11,200
piercing through our fontanel bone area and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,000
-That's what Christians refer to it?
- Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,800
What is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain,

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
but Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

46
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,800
Holy Ghost is the desire of God.

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,000
God Himself watches the working of the desire.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,200
And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When it..

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,300
 -Is this the central nervous system?
-No. It is in the triangular bone.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,300
It's this force. This is the forth force within us. You see,

52
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,400
we have sympathetic nervous system, left and right

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,600
and we have got autonomous, that is an autonomous nervous system and parasympathetic

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 and we have also central nervous system.

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,700
Now this is the system which is not yet working.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,000
It is still in the triangular bone.

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,000
When it rises it gives you you a new dimension of the Spirit.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,640
In that case what happens. It's very simple to understand that

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,100
at human level we are not in the absolute state,

61
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,000
not in the absolute state. That's why there is a chaos.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,300
Supposing I'm holding a snake in my hands, you see, and there's no light.

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Somebody tells me that there's a snake. I will not throw it away.

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I would not like to listen to anybody's advice about it.

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
But if there's a light, I'll throw it away.

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,100
 In the same way when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you.

67
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,400
You become your own master, you become your own guru. You don't have to have any guru for that.

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,500
This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,800
 gives you the power of the Spirit.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,700
But.. you will demonstrate us or at least will give you a chance to demonstrate

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,800
But you're talking about a physical power of the Spirit that comes out of the top of your head?

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
-No, it's an energy.
-An energy, alright.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,300
It's an energy, which comes out of your fontanel bone area, here,

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,600
area, touching the Spirit,
but the Spirit actually resides in the heart.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,300
But the main seat of the heart is here in the fontanel bone area.

76
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,810
And it pierces through, when it pierces through

77
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,700
actually it should pierce, it is not just I say I baptize you, It's not like that.

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,500
It has to pierce through that

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500
and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head.

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,400
-Is it there now?
-Yes it is there.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,500
-Can I feel it?
- I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not,

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
because you have to have that sensitivity.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Now, it is all around, also that All-pervading Power is there, which makes everything vibrate.

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,700
But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization.

85
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Then what happens that all your centers on your fingertips become sensitive.

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,140
And you can feel this is written in the Quran that your hands will speak when you get to your Resurrection.

87
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,200
- Yes.
- This is a Resurrection.

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,600
But Mataji, you must know, you must realize, I mentioned about Maharishi, about the bad ones,

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because...

90
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,600
-Of course, of course, I’m living with them all the time.
-Because they come before you.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,500
Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to gurus or to anything that is religious,

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,100
is that you cannot pay for God.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,000
You see it's a living process of a living God.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed.

95
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth?

96
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,500
It's a very simple thing, but people don't understand.

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,600
They think that they can purchase everything.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
You cannot purchase God.

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,100
A simple method if you apply to all of them they will all run away.

100
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,500
Yes, now again. I read that the Spirit, this power you speak of, can deal with ...common

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm into the content, but can deal with cancer, with AIDS,
-Yes, yes.

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,740
I've had some Australians talk about their children being heroin addicts and and

103
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes, of course, of course, it can, it does. Because see I'll show you now.

104
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
This is the centre, you can say this is the medulla oblongata

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,690
or we can say this is through which the central canal is passing.

106
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,400
Now, the centre is inside here.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,900
 Now when we are in the imbalance, say we go too much towards the left side

108
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,400
means we become too emotional or do all kinds of wrong nonsensical conditionings,

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,900
then or if you go too much to the right in ego and all that, you see, then we break.

110
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,000
Once we break this what happens that

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,500
the center becomes constricted and the energy becomes constricted.

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Slowly it breaks the relationship with the head, with the whole

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,000
and it becomes malignant. When it becomes malignant

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
it starts overpowering other cells and that's how cancer is settled.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,300
Now when the Kundalini rises what she does

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,350
she enlightens this centre here, first of all, she brings it back to normal

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,800
and then she goes up there, pierces through by which she does one great thing

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,800
is to make you in contact with the All-pervading Power.

119
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,000
And once that power starts flowing through you, you don't have to worry.

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,970
You become absolutely peaceful, all your troubles are over.

121
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,600
Actually, most of the troubles can be over once you are the Spirit.

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,130
All right. It's very difficult to understand and

123
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,000
Understand ..[...] as I'm doing now. You have offered to give a demonstration with our audience?

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,590
-Yes, I think I'll try but it's a very short time.
-Would you like?

125
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,400
And they are all in a hurry I think to catch the buses or something.

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,800
 No. no, they've got time to try.

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,500
All right. Let's see.

128
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Now, you just put your hands towards me, just like this.

129
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,500
And put your right hand on your heart.

130
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,900
and say with full faith in yourself that you are the Spirit.

131
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,100
 That's in your heart you have to say. "Mother, I am the Spirit".

132
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,800
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

133
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,520
"I am the Spirit". Please say three times

134
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,000
with full confidence in yourself.

135
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,500
Now put the right hand towards me and see on top of your head

136
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 if you are getting a cool breeze coming out of your head.

137
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,200
Yes, yes, here. On top of ... some people get it that high.

138
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,500
Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking.

139
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,580
Put your right hand towards me, right, right hand towards me,

140
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,100
right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

141
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,700
Right hand I am saying, right hand towards me you are doing all wrong.

142
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,690
Now see. Is it all right?

143
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,500
-Are you getting the cool breeze in your head?
-Say yes, if you are.

144
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes, yes, yes. I can see your eyes are.. Eyes will start glistening, you see, there will be a light in your eyes.

145
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,500
Now, are you thinking now? Just watch me without thinking. Let's see, can you do that?

146
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,200
Watch me without thinking. Can you do that?

147
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
You can.

148
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,600
You cannot do that otherwise. You see, so you have gone beyond thought.

149
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Now just feel it. Are you feeling it in the hand also? Just let's see.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Put your hands up if you've felt some way.

151
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,300
Put up all your hands. All of those who have felt it.

152
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Put both the hands. I would like to see both the hands.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let me show them, Madame.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,140
Yes, so many of them who have got it.

155
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,600
-Now we have some of your followers here ...
-Yes, who else?

156
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
-up, up here we had.
-All right, let's see.

157
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,780
Those who have felt in the head just put your hands up.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,980
Surprising, the audience seems to be..

159
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,460
Yesterday we had 1500 people out there and about 500 people upstairs.

160
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,100
-And most of them got Realisation.
-Yes.

161
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,500
Now, in fact, we should have said in the past when you've done it in Britain and

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,300
you've actually through radio and television you've told people

163
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,000
-at home to do the same.
-No, it’s Hong Kong. I did it in Hong Kong. Not in a..

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,570
In Hong Kong people are very sensitive. There are very sensitive people in Hong Kong.

165
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:37,300
Perhaps they are in trouble now, because they have to go away and all that. May be that is it.

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,500
People who are in need are more sensitive, are they?

167
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I’d think so, because then they hanker after God.

168
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,800
You see, otherwise they think. “We are alright, what to care for God, you see, who is God after all?”

169
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,300
So it happens. But it should happen to so many.

170
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
 I'm surprised they haven't got.

171
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,800
Let's see again how many have got it. Let's see.

172
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,910
 Put your hands up. Let's see. Just see.

173
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,410
They're reluctant even to put the hand to see, you see?

174
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Now just see it on your head.

175
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,100
I've been distracted actually. I'm not a fair test for this because I've been watching things happening in this studio.

176
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,630
Yes, that's it and they are...

177
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you feeling it?

178
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,000
No? None of you?

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,170
I think there’s something wrong.

180
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,100
I can feel the breezes coming from them, I can feel it.

181
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,400
Some of them are do feeling it. You see those, who are really feeling it,

182
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,300
do not feel ashamed and just say "Yes, we are feeling it. That's the best.

183
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,600
Can you raise your hands now, let's see?

184
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,000
These are all my disciples I think.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
-Surprising. Otherwise Australians are very good.
-Are they? We were receptive, were we?

186
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,000
They are the best people. They are very innocent  and they get their realization very fast.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They stick on to it, and they have done wonders. They have done wonders.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,800
I should make the point that I saw one of your advertisements in one of the papers today and  I think your..

189
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,490
there is a meeting tonight at the State Theatre in Sydney, but there is no fee charge.

190
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,500
Of course not.

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
-You’re not charging?
-No, no, not at all,

192
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
-You are not rounding up money?
-No.

193
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,900
No, I should make. Alright, we thank you for your time.

194
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,800
 You're staying another week or so in Australia?
-Yes.

195
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,500
You’ve been to other states, and you are now doing in Sydney?
-Yes. I’ll be going to Melbourne.

196
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
-Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand.
-And to New Zealand also.

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Alright, we thank you. I'm sure if you'd like to see Mataji,
-Thank you very much.

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,790
 you could check your regular newspapers and find where she's meeting people.

199
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,890
Thank you very much today. Please thank Her Mataji.
