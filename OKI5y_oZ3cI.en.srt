1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:11,970
Shri Mataji: When did you come back?

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,580
Yogi: I am here some of the time but I still
have to do things in Exeter.

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,580
Shri Mataji: He goes back?

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,580
Is it?

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,580
Yogi: I have to go back so often for work.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:35,460
I should be free of 

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,460
it soon Mother.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,130
Yogini: He has to go back so often but he’ll
be free soon Mother.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,390
Shri Mataji: Alright.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,370
Yogi: I owe money, you see, down there Mother.

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,370
Yogini: He says he earns money down there
Mother

12
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,370
Shri Mataji: Is it?

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,370
Yogi: Yes.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,370
Shri Mataji: I see.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,370
You sing there?

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,610
Yogi: Yeah, but I also owe some money and
I have to pay it and until I pay it I’m

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,149
not really free of it.

18
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,399
Yogini: Ah, he owes money Mother.

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,939
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

20
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:26,400
Money seems to be the problem everywhere and
it can be very sapping and it can be very

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
funny.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:50,950
Perhaps you do not know that we are just playing
into the hands of lots of negative forces

23
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,189
in this country and we are doing lots of things
which are really against the Divine, and the

24
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,359
curses, everybody will have to suffer.

25
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,509
We really have to understand our responsibility.

26
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:27,030
Whatever you people are, Sahaja Yogis are,
people are going to reap the benefit of God.

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,660
If they are suffering, you are responsible
for it – hundred percent.

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
One has to understand that.

29
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,879
If you are quarrelling amongst yourselves,
there will be 

30
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:44,180
a problem of quarrelling in the country.

31
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
You are the symbols for God.

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:59,959
He knows you and whenever you are negative
you are actually helping the Satan.

33
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,859
And it’s a very sad day I must say.

34
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:10,569
Everybody seems to be very much high handed
and – I am not saying about Steve, Steve

35
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:19,370
is not yet into this – but we have had big,
bad problems here in this ashram and it’s

36
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,129
horrible things have happened.

37
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,459
I have never had such an experience in India,
which is a poor country.

38
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,510
Never such a thing!

39
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:40,860
I mean, it’s the first time I have seen
such a thing happening!

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,030
First of all we all must get properly employed.

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:55,500
You must have your self-respect force you
to have a job.

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,620
You all must try to get a job.

43
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,310
This I have been telling for the last six
years, if you remember.

44
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:13,260
We cannot be parasites and could be Sahaja
Yogis – cannot be.

45
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,840
Everybody must find out a job for oneself.

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,320
Do whatever you please, but you must do some
job.

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:30,360
Imagine in India people spend money on you
people!

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,380
I have never had any problem whatsoever to
solve of this kind, in India – never!

49
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,470
You know that very well.

50
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,010
And when I am so strict with them, thinking
they are Indians, that all the money that

51
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:56,260
they have gathered in Bombay or in Delhi,
or any place, is clamped, completely closed.

52
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,290
And nobody can take a single pie (1/192 rupee)
out of that without my permission!

53
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,300
Absolutely I have told the banks.

54
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,040
And nobody is unhappy about it.

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Not a single pie!

56
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:20,140
But when we go, they make collections and
whatever money they collect, every pie of

57
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,130
that is written down clearly.

58
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,910
First of all they give all that money to me,
then I give that money to them to spend.

59
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,530
And every single pie that they spend they
write it down.

60
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,290
I may or may not read – is not the point.

61
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:44,350
And whatever is left out, every single pie
of that is put on my feet.

62
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,110
I may put to any use or anything – that’s
a different point.

63
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,400
I may not even take it – that’s a different
point.

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,690
But every pie!

65
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,800
Nobody is without a job.

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,130
This parasitic nature of any other country
may be excused but not of England.

67
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:16,380
In England you cannot be a parasite because,
I told you, that the heart of the universe

68
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:37,580
is here, and if anything happens, you all
will be held responsible.

69
00:06:37,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Now you are going to another ashram (Chelsham
Road) and you are going to stay there.

70
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:19,970
Ashram is not a place for a luxurious life,
not at all, or lethargy and laziness or for

71
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,360
making money or living free!

72
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,510
It’s absurd!

73
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,800
It’s sinful, it’s blasphemy.

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:45,530
That’s the place where you go to develop
your inner being with all truthfulness to

75
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,550
yourself.

76
00:07:46,550 --> 00:08:02,360
Before Realisation this was alright, every
way, but after Realisation you have to be

77
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,090
very, very careful.

78
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:14,850
It’s a tremendous thing to have Awakening,
it’s a tremendous thing to have Realisation,

79
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:22,790
it is, no doubt, but to maintain it, you must
have, first of all, personal integrity.

80
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:30,470
If you are bent upon deceiving yourself nobody
can help you.

81
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:45,870
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, there is no fees,
nothing.

82
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,260
It’s for your gain.

83
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,150
It’s for your good.

84
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,320
It’s a short term policy to be something
nonsensical.

85
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,850
One must think of the long term policy.

86
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,590
It’s for your good.

87
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:14,920
If we have to go higher and higher, we have
to be truthful to ourselves.

88
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,770
I know everything about everyone, but what’s
the use?

89
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:30,570
You have know about yourself.

90
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,960
And this may be very dangerous, you must understand,
because we are placed at a very precarious

91
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,990
time now.

92
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,240
Because of that you are getting Realisation
because it’s very emergent – there’s

93
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,630
a great emergency.

94
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,120
Thousands of them have to get Realisation,
no doubt.

95
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:07,670
But at this time one has to also understand
the dangers of the atmosphere.

96
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,670
Because of so many things that have happened
in this ashram, I cannot account for anything.

97
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:19,960
I just can’t understand it in Sahaja Yoga.

98
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,580
Such people should not stay in the ashram
at all, they should get out of it.

99
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,460
Everybody cannot stay in the ashram.

100
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:38,310
You must be prepared to face yourself.

101
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:46,890
Absolutely, there’s no doubt about it.

102
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:55,450
I love you very much and I have great concern
about you, but the sort of things we are doing

103
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,779
we are just like primitive people here.

104
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,470
Simple things we cannot do – is to be honest
to ourselves.

105
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,350
What are we going to do?

106
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,660
We have to give salvation to the whole world.

107
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,320
How can we do it?

108
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Just tell me?

109
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:24,690
I am sorry for all that is happening but now,
with a new vow and with a new understanding,

110
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,030
we have to go to the other ashram.

111
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:37,100
Obedience is very important, humility is very
important.

112
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,680
We have to go still further.

113
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,710
Anybody who is obstinate by nature should
not stay in an ashram!

114
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,640
Anybody who is arrogant or aggressive should
never come to the ashram.

115
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,500
Any sarcasm and all that is nonsense for an
ashram: it brings a bad name to the ashram.

116
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,030
Any kind of extravagance is not needed.

117
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,200
It’s a place of ascetics; people who have
detached their life.

118
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,660
Detachment doesn’t mean going to extremes,
standing on your heads and behaving in a funny

119
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,801
manner on the street carrying my photograph
in the hand!

120
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,020
It doesn’t mean that nonsense.

121
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:28,850
It’s absolutely normal behaviour but inside
the attention has to be drawn inside.

122
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,390
Anybody who is intelligent can understand
that Sahaja Yoga is a tremendously fantastic

123
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:43,320
thing and one should not take it for granted.

124
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:53,560
It’s very, very, sometimes, disheartening,
very disheartening, the way still the interest

125
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:04,990
of the people is more into some things which
are absolutely worthless and useless.

126
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:18,180
Your attention has to be cleared out, then
only this attention which is enlightened,

127
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,730
is going to enjoy the Spirit.

128
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:34,430
And, as we were discussing the smog: like
the smog, the whole being becomes darkened

129
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,970
and black.

130
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:47,430
It’s not nice for me, as a Mother, to say
all these things, it really kills me.

131
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,180
I really feel very hurt.

132
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,950
But I must tell you the headaches [that] London
Sahaja Yogis and English Sahaja Yogis have

133
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,960
given me, as nobody has given me such headaches.

134
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,580
I have worked hardest in this place.

135
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,300
It’s very, very sad.

136
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:22,930
You should read the letter from a girl from
Australia and a letter from a girl from Switzerland.

137
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:30,470
I just met her once – I gave her Realisation
– but look at them, how beautiful they are!

138
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,190
I mean just see it (Mother is opening a letter).

139
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,530
And when I get really concerned about you
I just read these letters.

140
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,590
So truthful!

141
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,330
There’s not only the praise and all that
nonsense, it’s the truth.

142
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:50,240
I mean, there you can feel the vibrations
are coming from these letters only.

143
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,840
What’s the use of writing to me something
which you are not?

144
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:06,120
Now, you have to take a decision.

145
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,330
Even if you are only two persons in Sahaja
Yoga I don’t mind.

146
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:18,080
I don’t want people who are not truthful;
who want to compromise with nonsense and falsehood.

147
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,940
Please, be truthful.

148
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:32,220
You cannot say that I worked any less.

149
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,210
I have spared no effort at all.

150
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,180
But I am very sad today.

151
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,959
The whole thing will fritter away.

152
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:54,060
Sometimes I feel that Sahaja Yoga is not suited
to you people at all, the way the things are.

153
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
It’s so beautiful outside.

154
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
You can’t imagine how people are nice.

155
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Are you going to waste all my energies?

156
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:09,790
It’s not even the normal way people behave
here.

157
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,380
It’s most surprising!

158
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:22,279
I have told you that after Realisation you
become really vulnerable and you have to be

159
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,279
careful.

160
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,589
Now [regarding] marriages I would like to
say something.

161
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,589
Is he come?

162
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:28,589
Tony [Paniotou] Is he there?

163
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:29,589
He didn’t come.

164
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:52,170
Marriages are not to be treated like that
the marriages you have been treating!

165
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,410
This is something important!

166
00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:09,870
You are married for a plan and the plan is
to get very high souls into you.

167
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:17,279
They are to be born on this earth.

168
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:29,710
They wanted good parents, that’s why I arranged
this marriage system here.

169
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,880
And all of you are giving me headaches!

170
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,470
Even that fellow Rustom, who I took to India,
he is giving me headache even today!

171
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,830
God knows [if] he’s in India or not.

172
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,179
People don’t know where he has disappeared!

173
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,690
I mean, just like vagabonds or criminals!

174
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,190
This is criminality, I think, the way people
are behaving.

175
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,900
I have never said these things to you but
when the whole thing comes up I just don’t

176
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,450
know what to say!

177
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:13,629
You have no understanding of the whole thing.

178
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:19,489
Or have I chosen absolutely rotten stuff for
my work in England?

179
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:23,669
You have no depth, no understanding of any
kind.

180
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,549
So childishly and immaturely you are handling
your marriages.

181
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:34,070
There’s no respect for each other.

182
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:45,080
Marriage is an institution of a great value;
specially, I thought, if it is done in a Sahaja

183
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
way.

184
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,919
I just can’t understand – how can you
think of the same things that you would do

185
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,830
without being Realised?

186
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,080
You fight, you quarrel, you are so petty!

187
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:08,590
How can you behave like that?

188
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,960
You are supposed to be the pillars.

189
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,269
If these are the pillars, I don’t know about
the future.

190
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:27,590
I’m really very sad today, really very sad
– in every angle.

191
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,809
Even I have heard that people don’t know
even how to keep the bathrooms clean.

192
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,809
Now am I to teach you how to keep bathrooms?

193
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,302
You are putting big lemons in the bathrooms
and WCs and loos?

194
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:37,302
What is this?

195
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,302
Have you gone off your heads?

196
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,302
Are you small children?

197
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,570
Or what am I to do now with you?

198
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,570
Why are you doing like this?

199
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:51,759
Are you all possessed?

200
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:59,830
What has happened?

201
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,559
Restrictions you have to put upon yourself,
with your own freedom and understanding and

202
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,559
intelligence.

203
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,110
I am not going to tell you to do this or do
that.

204
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,379
That’s a different style.

205
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:17,230
You have got the Realisation so easily, in
a simple way.

206
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,230
All over the world people have got Realisation.

207
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,230
In Australia there are three hundred people
who have got Realisation.

208
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:26,129
You don’t know how to use your loo?

209
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:31,280
I mean what sort of a level it is that I have
to deal with?

210
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
Just tell me.

211
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:42,639
Even my little grandchild knows how to do
it.

212
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:46,259
What’s the matter?

213
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,190
There is no place for lazy people in Sahaja
Yoga.

214
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,830
You all get out of these ideas.

215
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,830
You want to laze out?

216
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,210
You can get out!

217
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,580
And those who want to make money out of Sahaja
Yoga, get out please!

218
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,090
I don’t want to see their faces again.

219
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,749
Anybody who is supposed to be working for
Sahaja Yoga has to work outside.

220
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:06,960
There’s no place for lazy lumps!

221
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,009
You get out of Sahaja Yog completely!

222
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:14,720
I don’t want to see your faces again here!

223
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,049
It’s my love that has ruined you?

224
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,049
Or what has happened?

225
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,450
It’s too much love for you I believe.

226
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,179
Is it that?

227
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,230
Somebody starts thinking he’s a big guru
teaching others.

228
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,230
Nonsense!

229
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:38,039
Hundred times I have told you: there is nothing
like segmentation in Sahaja Yog.

230
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,350
You all are just my children, all of them,
and you are not to do this way: to put somebody

231
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:49,200
down and bring somebody else up, make chelas
(disciples) and things like that.

232
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,639
Why don’t you start some gurudom yourself
and make some money outside?

233
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,779
You will do very well!

234
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:02,600
Is this the way to treat me?

235
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:12,179
What have I done to deserve all this?

236
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:21,549
Because I have loved you so much so you should
take me for granted and do all these things

237
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,659
for me?

238
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,850
Not working out your Realisation, not going
ahead, nothing of the kind; except for fighting

239
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,440
amongst yourselves and misbehaving!

240
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,769
Everybody thinks they are very clever and
intelligent.

241
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:43,789
It’s better to have less intelligent people
who understand God and goodness and righteousness

242
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:46,000
in life.

243
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You have to wed yourself to righteousness.

244
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,269
This is not another gurudom going on here.

245
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,331
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis or one
Sahaja Yogi in London it’s sufficient for

246
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,331
me.

247
00:22:55,331 --> 00:23:04,679
I don’t want a quantity of thousands of
horrible, synthetic personalities.

248
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:21,253
I can work on one person all my life and I’ll
be happy.

249
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:24,679
Even the candle understands me.

250
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,869
You have seen even the fire understands me.

251
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,129
You should not take God for granted.

252
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:38,840
I am telling you again and again; and Divine
for granted.

253
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,169
You have to become something.

254
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:48,020
You have to grow up.

255
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
I think I have done my level best.

256
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
I cannot do better that way.

257
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:56,619
I may disappear to India and I’ll go away.

258
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:02,710
That’s the best for you people: you fight
with each other, break each other’s necks

259
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:08,389
or plunder each other’s money and live with
that!

260
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:11,850
That’s what it is.

261
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,659
Just imagine how I must be feeling to say
all these things to you whom I have loved

262
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,369
with all my heart, with all my concern, with
all my time, everything.

263
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:33,269
You’ve made me so miserable, I tell you!

264
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,659
You will take a vow, you’ll do this and
then least bothered!

265
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,140
You can live with it!

266
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,090
You are compromising all the time with all
the cunning that is within.

267
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,090
You think I don’t understand the cunning?

268
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,090
But you are cheating yourselves!

269
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,090
You have to be righteous.

270
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,960
Sahaja Yoga is not outside, it is inside!

271
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,159
It is not standing on your heads and doing
things like that, it is inside, the growth

272
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,159
inside.

273
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,159
You will lose all your vibrations in no time.

274
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:13,919
But that’s a dangerous thing to happen.

275
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:30,179
How do you permit such things?

276
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,749
Also I hold them responsible [those] who permitted
these things.

277
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:39,789
Why did you permit in the ashram [that] these
things were happening?

278
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,720
Why didn’t you find out?

279
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,210
All this kind of high-handedness and all that
– how did you permit it?

280
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,809
Why did you permit it?

281
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:00,220
Why didn’t you tell me?

282
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,100
I mean, I have to be bothered about money
and these things?

283
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Is it?

284
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,750
Is that my purpose of life and work and mission?

285
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,340
Or you have reduced me to that?

286
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,179
It’s very sad.

287
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:28,390
I think I’ll have to fast for a week for
your cleansing, that’s the only way things

288
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:34,000
are going to work out, because you don’t
want to cleanse yourself.

289
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,429
Only when Mataji is facing you you think by
vibrations you know.

290
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,989
What about your own growth?

291
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:52,409
I knew there was something brewing up but
I didn’t pay attention to it.

292
00:26:52,409 --> 00:27:02,570
I thought that you, yourself, will realise
and come to it and you will have your own

293
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,519
understanding.

294
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,799
Everything seems to be mechanical.

295
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,309
Everything seems to be outward.

296
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:11,049
There’s nothing inside.

297
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:21,679
Sahaja Yoga is not a joke – you cannot make
it.

298
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,679
You have to love each other truthfully.

299
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:38,229
And anybody who does any mistake has to get
out of Sahaj Yog.

300
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:44,460
It’s all deliberate.

301
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,639
Because I had told you that you will be possessed.

302
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,019
Be careful!

303
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:56,399
It’s nice to put everything in the name
of a Satanic forces working on us!

304
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,460
Then if you going to live with the guidance
of others it’s better you stay with them

305
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,190
permanently and go with them wherever they
are going.

306
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,859
If you do not have your own personality and
you cannot think for yourself it’s better

307
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,009
you be out.

308
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:19,849
Those who really want to come up should come
to Sahaja Yoga otherwise there is no need

309
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:20,849
to do it.

310
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:40,119
If I have spared in any way you can tell me
that.

311
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:49,190
I think I have not sighed for years now and
the time has come for you to sigh and sit

312
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,909
and that’s what it is.

313
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:51,940
It’s very sad.

314
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,629
There are people who write to me.

315
00:28:53,629 --> 00:29:02,059
You can see from their letters how much they
are doing for others, how beautiful they are.

316
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:11,919
I don’t know when am I going to get that
quality in this country.

317
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:21,559
You have to mature, you have to face yourself.

318
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:27,929
If you do not mature in proper time you will
be rotting on the street.

319
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:31,259
You will be just wasted – useless.

320
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,440
You will be just like other people.

321
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,940
There’s no difference between you and others
then.

322
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,919
You have to mature in proper time at the right
time.

323
00:29:40,919 --> 00:30:00,399
I have really started doubting myself now,
that I am no good for you people.

324
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,779
You need a stronger hand and a sterner person
who will handle you better.

325
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:21,489
I have been hearing from people who came for
the first time and they told me something

326
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:28,470
about someone and something about someone
and all that.

327
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,769
But I said, “They have come just now, they
cannot understand."

328
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:30,769
But no!

329
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,940
It exists.

330
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,601
And if you have any of such things within
you, even a slightest hatred within you can

331
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:49,330
create a Hitler in this world.

332
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:58,049
You are the people who are going to create
a Hitler or God’s world.

333
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,049
It’s your desire.

334
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:04,889
You have to cleanse your hearts completely,
completely.

335
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:09,399
Cleanse yourself.

336
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:14,369
It’s not [that] you are possessed.

337
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,779
Just think it over.

338
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:21,179
It’s your own weaknesses and you think that
you can get away with it.

339
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,059
You cannot get away with anything I tell you.

340
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:27,739
God’s laws and statutes are very strict.

341
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:35,450
That’s why all the gurus are so strict with
their disciples; extremely strict.

342
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,759
Those who are real gurus, I am saying, those
who are not making money.

343
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,349
Of course, those who are making money will
always pamper you.

344
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:54,320
But those who are not making money, who are
true gurus, are very strict.

345
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,870
Mostly they throw stones at their disciples.

346
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:07,879
But I gave you flowers and you gave me stones!

347
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:11,879
That is the best!

348
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:21,950
It’s everything is only tongue deep, nothing
more!

349
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,080
Nothing goes in the heart, that’s why.

350
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:41,909
If you feel it from the heart, the need to
grow, then you will forget all these things.

351
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:53,230
If you feel your Spirit you will feel that
need, that urge, to grow.

352
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:06,590
Only your ego or superego is manifesting,
not your Spirit.

353
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:19,470
If I say something, the best way to run away
from it is to feel bad about it.

354
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,909
The second best would be to feel guilty about
it.

355
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:31,980
But just detach yourself and become your Spirit
and think what have you been doing to yourself.

356
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,629
Actually you are harming yourself every minute!

357
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:44,779
You cannot harm me, you cannot harm Sahaj
Yog, these are all eternal things.

358
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:52,740
They are eternal, they cannot be harmed, they
cannot be crucified, they cannot be killed,

359
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,450
but you are covering your Spirit with darkness.

360
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:06,679
I have never seen such things happening so
far.

361
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:17,929
I mean, I have worked even in East Africa,
all over, but never, never such things.

362
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:23,540
This is demonic I don’t know how you can
explain it.

363
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,780
I didn’t know you were not keeping any accounts.

364
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,829
I had no idea.

365
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:33,929
I had no idea at all [that] you were keeping
no accounts.

366
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,740
I had no idea that money was taken from others
and everybody coming here was paying and nobody

367
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,169
knew what was paid, who was paid, who was
not paying.

368
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:43,859
Nothing is known!

369
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:56,059
I mean, I thought at least that much you can
manage among yourselves.

370
00:34:56,059 --> 00:35:04,220
And you know me, I am so particular about,
if you spend any money on me, how much I am

371
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:10,840
anxious to pay you back – every single pie.

372
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,680
If I have forgotten I don’t know, but if
I have not.

373
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,059
I try to remember every single pie if you
spend.

374
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:28,059
I mean, you are supposed to spend for your
guru, but I do not want you to spend a single

375
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,579
pie on me!

376
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:38,280
And if you spend I want to pay it back more
than what you have spent.

377
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,800
Nobody does this way.

378
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:53,650
And I remember ten times that it should be
paid.

379
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:01,100
Telling false accounts and false things.

380
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:08,100
I mean, I just can’t understand how can
Sahaja Yogis do it.

381
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:15,170
Now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they take
to drinking or smoking or something.

382
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:30,860
I mean, anything is possible under the sun.

383
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:38,810
I mean, if you can do such depraved things,
you can do anything!

384
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,539
After all you are free!

385
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:46,462
This abandonment at this time is very dangerous.

386
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:51,380
I had told you that, when the saints fall
they go very deep down, very deep down.

387
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,809
So be careful: you are all saints now.

388
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:53,920
Understand that, realise it.

389
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Assume your powers.

390
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:07,099
Assume your seats, your thrones, and don’t
behave like beggars on the street or criminals.

391
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,643
There is no excuse for such people.

392
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,580
No excuse at all.

393
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:20,000
Do not try to find excuses!

394
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:38,079
There were so many people yesterday who were
not Sahaja Yogis and I didn’t want to say

395
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,880
there, in their presence yesterday these things.

396
00:37:43,880 --> 00:38:03,510
But I came to know about these horrible things
which happened and I was amazed!

397
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,619
Everything should be in the open in Sahaja
Yoga, I have told you a hundred times; not

398
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,859
to hide anything.

399
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,180
Accounts, everything should be written down.

400
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,640
You will be amazed, when I go to India, you
will see, even Rahuri, it’s a village where

401
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,339
there are people paying £5, £10.

402
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:28,289
They make a book, when I go there, at my feet.

403
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:36,270
They leave it with me for one day that, “Mother
please see it.

404
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,630
You must see it.

405
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,140
At least glance."

406
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,660
I mean, imagine!

407
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,280
These are uneducated, simple village folks
and they understand.

408
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,180
Even my servant!

409
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,340
My servant has so much sense!

410
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,690
He’s so honest.

411
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:09,150
No Sahaja Yogi should ever marry a Sahaja
Yogini.

412
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,430
Better stop all that seeking.

413
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,890
And now this nonsense has started now, working
out.

414
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:20,289
As it is the problem of money management is
horrible and then if you start like this there

415
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,400
cannot be, no more, any yogi left!

416
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:33,059
It’s better to marry outside than to marry
a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini.

417
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:40,849
As if the bhoots go into geometrical progression
when they marry and they become so horrid

418
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:46,160
and ugly; if there was a saint to be born
he’ll run away!

419
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,510
Only the bhoots and the rakshasas will be
born to these people!

420
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,710
That’s what I can see.

421
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:55,730
The way they talk and the way they behave
it’s so funny.

422
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,410
I can’t believe it that they are the same
Sahaja Yogis who were married the other day!

423
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:09,610
(the marriage of Tony Paniotou and Dawn whom
Mother married on 4 July 1980)

424
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:20,240
Every pie that is spent now has to be shown
to me because you do not count all those.

425
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,099
No money should be borrowed from each other!

426
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:30,400
Not a single pie.

427
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:40,019
Everything that is financial, you have to
tell me.

428
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:57,180
Everything that you are doing in the name
of Sahaja Yoga you have to tell me or in the

429
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:05,390
group of Sahaja Yogis you must tell.

430
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,720
You’d better not do anything on your own.

431
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,869
Then you will be blessed.

432
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:08,890
“Yoga kshema Vahamyaham” First yoga.

433
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,890
First yoga.

434
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,890
Achieve your yoga!

435
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,610
All your problems will be solved.

436
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,970
I promise you.

437
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,450
First achieve your yoga.

438
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,140
You have seen so many people.

439
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,930
It has happened with so many.

440
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,930
You know Regis’ case as you have seen.

441
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,549
He could not get through his PhD.

442
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:36,960
I only blessed his thesis.

443
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,900
I didn’t even read!

444
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,829
Nothing of the kind.

445
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:43,730
Next day he became a Dr!

446
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,720
I mean, there are so many cases, thousand
and one, you can see it, where yoga has helped.

447
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,870
But yoga must be achieved and maintained and
respected.

448
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:58,250
If you are not a yogi why should God bless
you?

449
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,599
For what?

450
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,410
Why should he bless you?

451
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,839
Then the kshema also changes it’s form.

452
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,390
There’s a lady who has written to me from
Australia.

453
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:17,380
She wrote to me, “My grandmother is very
sick Mother and I don’t know what to do.

454
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,799
And I want that she should be helped."

455
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:29,289
And she wanted to do some operation or something
but she was so much better that they did not

456
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:30,289
operate her.

457
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:34,319
But she had to go on a nursing home and there
was no reservation, nothing; suddenly she

458
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:41,559
got a call that there’s suddenly a reservation
for you and you come.

459
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:51,339
I mean, this is one of the smallest things
that can happen.

460
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:57,599
Yoga is to be established on two points.

461
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:05,849
The sin against the Mother and the sin against
the Father.

462
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:16,230
Sin against the Mother is when you do not
look after your chastity.

463
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,940
Your attention has to be pure and purer and
purest.

464
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:36,790
And the sin against the Father is when you
try to make money here and there: cut corners

465
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:44,539
and try to save money and run after money
and worry about it.

466
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:52,730
Any such enterprise, any such thing: underhand
dealings, high hand dealings, anything like

467
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,050
that, is the sin against the Father.

468
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:09,910
You are the people who have started believing,
also, that money is not important.

469
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:15,670
So, according to them, if you make some frauds
it doesn’t matter, “After all money is

470
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,710
not important so what?”

471
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:27,720
And they have reached such conclusions.

472
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:36,799
But in the name of God, to take a single pie
is a sin.

473
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:44,760
In the same way, to mishandle even a single
pie while dealing with God – be careful,

474
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:52,519
I am telling you!

475
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:54,740
And grace cannot help you there!

476
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,410
And this is a very sensitive point.

477
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:06,910
For you it may not be, but for God it is.

478
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:25,839
Those who make money in the name of God are
equally bad [as] those who try to do anything

479
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,280
to hide money.

480
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,619
It’s just the same.

481
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:49,769
This is the work of God and you have to be
pure people, you have to be clean, beautiful,

482
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:53,349
loving people, like children.

483
00:45:53,349 --> 00:46:01,890
Christ has said that you have to be like children
to be able to enter into the Kingdom of God.

484
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:14,170
But you have entered and you’ll be thrown
back!

485
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:21,869
There is more attention towards gaining more
power, like saying mantras after mantras,

486
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:24,140
this, that, just to gain power.

487
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,510
What power is this?

488
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,609
The power is of innocence and of purity.

489
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:36,150
There is no other power higher than this – of
simple innocence and purity.

490
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:40,579
And you know that from me.

491
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:45,829
An innocent person can never be harmed.

492
00:46:45,829 --> 00:47:04,869
Try to be humble and ask for innocence to
