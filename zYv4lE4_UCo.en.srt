00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,310
1998-0418 Evening Program At Easter Puja,
 Istanbul, Turkey

2
00:00:05,804 --> 00:16:45,804
From 2:07:52

3
02:07:52,672 --> 02:07:59,255
I never expected such a beautiful pandal  
you have raised  that

4
02:07:59,305 --> 02:08:02,039
the way you have organized the

5
02:08:02,085 --> 02:08:05,748
stage as if you are all experts 
on stage arrangements.

6
02:08:05,773 --> 02:08:09,996
I can’t understand
 how beautiful it was all done.

7
02:08:10,036 --> 02:08:15,247
Now I don’t know what to say about
 all the programs that you have arranged.

8
02:08:15,306 --> 02:08:17,555
One better than the other

9
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:21,754
and it shows such a capacity you have

10
02:08:21,779 --> 02:08:28,387
or you have developed to organize such beautiful

11
02:08:28,412 --> 02:08:32,915
 entertaining continuous programs.

12
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:36,156
I used to do the same when I was young.

13
02:08:36,181 --> 02:08:38,516
I used to arrange many programs

14
02:08:38,541 --> 02:08:42,215
and I know the difficulties and hurdles we had.

15
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,559
Because the people 
who did that were not Sahaja Yogis.

16
02:08:45,584 --> 02:08:48,610
You are all Sahaja Yogis so you are also combining

17
02:08:48,614 --> 02:08:51,622
and you are helping each other so beautifully.

18
02:08:51,647 --> 02:08:55,809
There is so much of harmony, no problem of any kind.

19
02:08:55,983 --> 02:09:02,390
This is something to be seen 
and to be felt the way it has been done.

20
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:05,830
I was really surprised the way

21
02:09:05,855 --> 02:09:08,229
they had the Turkish dance also.

22
02:09:08,254 --> 02:09:10,613
These people are beautiful dancers

23
02:09:10,638 --> 02:09:13,171
and they can be paid very heavily.

24
02:09:13,196 --> 02:09:15,356
If somehow I could introduce them

25
02:09:15,381 --> 02:09:17,783
to some sarama  people from India.

26
02:09:17,819 --> 02:09:22,482
They used this kind of dance very much 
and but it is very difficult.

27
02:09:22,507 --> 02:09:25,278
I don’t know if you understand 
there is the myth patterns

28
02:09:25,303 --> 02:09:30,567
of those people who danced here 
and who are so fast.

29
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:34,578
My husband used to always tell me that

30
02:09:34,626 --> 02:09:37,581
Turkish people are the most capable people.

31
02:09:37,606 --> 02:09:40,617
If they take to anything they do it very well.

32
02:09:40,642 --> 02:09:46,259
And I can see that in three years time 
this whole of Istanbul has changed.

33
02:09:46,284 --> 02:09:49,794
So many new buildings have come up, is so different

34
02:09:49,819 --> 02:09:55,121
that you can’t make out it the same road
or the same place you are in.

35
02:09:55,862 --> 02:09:57,917
So we have to learn from them

36
02:09:57,942 --> 02:10:00,825
is to be capable is one

37
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:03,463
and to have a speed very important.

38
02:10:03,488 --> 02:10:07,178
Though I don’t like the speed
 that comes and goes like.

39
02:10:07,203 --> 02:10:10,879
If you have to go to the airport 
suddenly you get speedy.

40
02:10:10,904 --> 02:10:15,266
But the speed in the sense 
that when you are doing something

41
02:10:15,291 --> 02:10:18,009
you must have that balance within yourselves

42
02:10:18,034 --> 02:10:23,880
and you must do with a kind of a divine spirit

43
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:27,296
with that you will achieve so many things.

44
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,000
As you have seen today

45
02:10:29,034 --> 02:10:33,094
how these people are singing the qawwali

46
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:39,378
or a little girl sang so well Ganesha Stuti and others also.

47
02:10:39,403 --> 02:10:42,588
So well done that is unbelievable.

48
02:10:42,613 --> 02:10:45,927
For Romanian girls to do this nath

49
02:10:45,952 --> 02:10:48,801
paratnatyam is something, I can’t understand.

50
02:10:48,826 --> 02:10:52,361
But Romania I think is a Gandharva.

51
02:10:52,386 --> 02:10:56,838
What you call the [UNCLEAR] musicians place.

52
02:10:56,863 --> 02:10:59,026
You get all kind of musicians there

53
02:10:59,051 --> 02:11:03,211
and suddenly you find so many beautiful dancers there.

54
02:11:03,236 --> 02:11:06,517
Who are doing Kathak and also

55
02:11:06,542 --> 02:11:09,033
this very difficult dance Paratnatyam

56
02:11:09,058 --> 02:11:11,671
and also I have seen doing Kathakali

57
02:11:11,696 --> 02:11:14,542
It is very surprising how they have picked up

58
02:11:14,567 --> 02:11:18,031
like a Kuchipudi dance which is a very fast number.

59
02:11:18,056 --> 02:11:21,818
And they are so good. 
I mean as if the rhythm is built in their body

60
02:11:21,843 --> 02:11:24,243
the way they do it. I am surprised.

61
02:11:24,275 --> 02:11:30,223
They are very beautiful also [UNCLEAR] musicians there.

62
02:11:30,264 --> 02:11:34,115
And you see them how they are picked this qawwali

63
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:39,030
which is such a difficult thing to sing 
with all the alaps and things.

64
02:11:39,055 --> 02:11:42,773
But they have managed it somehow very beautifully.

65
02:11:42,798 --> 02:11:45,269
If somebody listens to it from outside

66
02:11:45,294 --> 02:11:49,493
they will think that somebody like Nusrat Ali sing.

67
02:11:49,677 --> 02:11:53,744
It is very beautifully done 
and my all congratulations to them.

68
02:11:53,769 --> 02:11:58,884
Apart from that, I must say
 that Indian music is very difficult

69
02:11:58,909 --> 02:12:02,398
and people learn for ages to master it.

70
02:12:02,423 --> 02:12:05,252
But how in Sahaja Yoga you have done so well,

71
02:12:05,277 --> 02:12:11,517
for example, Selim playing the sarod
like an instrument so well.

72
02:12:11,542 --> 02:12:13,869
Well you know I asked Hamzad Ali.

73
02:12:13,894 --> 02:12:17,253
He said ten years he was just practising.

74
02:12:17,278 --> 02:12:21,693
So what is this happen to you all that 
you are doing so well?

75
02:12:21,718 --> 02:12:26,278
Especially I find in Babamama  School

76
02:12:26,303 --> 02:12:29,214
that he has started. He himself is amazed

77
02:12:29,239 --> 02:12:35,393
because in three days three months they can sing

78
02:12:35,418 --> 02:12:38,633
a melody like Malcolm’s

79
02:12:38,658 --> 02:12:43,911
for which people have to work 
for years together and they just go on.

80
02:12:43,936 --> 02:12:46,774
So from where this knowledge has come to them.

81
02:12:46,799 --> 02:12:51,251
Is it from the previous life
 or is it your spirit God knows.

82
02:12:51,276 --> 02:12:54,899
Because he says even Sahaja Yogis who are Indians

83
02:12:54,924 --> 02:12:59,442
who are realized souls can’t do 
the way these westerners are doing.

84
02:12:59,467 --> 02:13:03,837
Means this something really
 the whole music thing [UNCLEAR]

85
02:13:03,862 --> 02:13:07,888
towards the west now 
I think the way people have taken.

86
02:13:07,913 --> 02:13:10,349
It was very very beautifully done,

87
02:13:10,374 --> 02:13:12,335
extremely entertaining for me.

88
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:14,486
I didn’t know how the time past.

89
02:13:14,511 --> 02:13:18,888
It was such an endeavour on your part to do this.

90
02:13:18,913 --> 02:13:22,637
Beautifully this all pandal is done so well.

91
02:13:22,662 --> 02:13:27,092
I mean I never expected in Turkey 
all this thing could happen.

92
02:13:27,119 --> 02:13:30,019
We have only one person Nese

93
02:13:30,044 --> 02:13:35,285
she is a young lady and 
how she has organized in this very gratitude.

94
02:13:35,437 --> 02:13:37,897
Also gratitude  very creditable to

95
02:13:37,932 --> 02:13:40,010
to Greek people to come here,

96
02:13:40,035 --> 02:13:43,846
and take such part and help them.

97
02:13:43,871 --> 02:13:50,356
You see this is a very nice idea
 to have Greeks and Turkish to be together.

98
02:13:50,381 --> 02:13:54,342
Because they are having a fight 
otherwise you see for the petrol.

99
02:13:54,367 --> 02:13:56,164
For the petrol, I think.

100
02:13:56,189 --> 02:13:59,937
And this can finish with Sahaja Yoga.

101
02:13:59,962 --> 02:14:06,198
that this fight between Turkey 
and Greece will end very soon.

102
02:14:06,585 --> 02:14:10,501
Another thing which is very remarkable is

103
02:14:10,526 --> 02:14:16,537
the way you pronounce also Indian words 
so well. l am surprised.

104
02:14:16,562 --> 02:14:20,501
Because not easy to pronounce them so easily.

105
02:14:20,526 --> 02:14:27,189
And to accept the accent so clearly.

106
02:14:27,214 --> 02:14:30,684
It is very very remarkable I must say.

107
02:14:30,709 --> 02:14:36,507
Of course, I mean not that
 Indian music is the last word.

108
02:14:36,569 --> 02:14:41,873
It is not that always that is the only one 
that is the highest.

109
02:14:41,898 --> 02:14:45,035
For example, I have also heard Austrians

110
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:52,327
back playing very beautiful orchestra 
from Vivaldi and Mozart and all that.

111
02:14:52,352 --> 02:14:54,398
So it is something happens to you.

112
02:14:54,423 --> 02:15:01,468
I think within that you start acquiring 
this talent of music

113
02:15:01,493 --> 02:15:08,453
and acquiring the talent of playing the music,
 understanding the music so well.

114
02:15:08,922 --> 02:15:11,146
Is not possible.

115
02:15:11,448 --> 02:15:16,984
So this is if this is the blessing of Sahaja Yoga 
half of the work is done.

116
02:15:17,019 --> 02:15:23,372
Because through this musical notes only the vibrations flow.

117
02:15:23,397 --> 02:15:29,236
When the music is played I find
 so much vibration goes out automatically.

118
02:15:29,261 --> 02:15:33,595
Of course, it has to be in tune. 
It has to be in rhythm

119
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:40,640
but otherwise, there is no other way out
 to spread the vibrations.

120
02:15:40,775 --> 02:15:44,928
So music plays a very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

121
02:15:44,953 --> 02:15:47,995
And even if you don’t understand it doesn’t matter.

122
02:15:48,021 --> 02:15:53,197
Because vibrations flow and 
you get the blessings of the vibrations.

123
02:15:53,222 --> 02:15:55,089
Music is very important.

124
02:15:55,114 --> 02:15:58,803
But no one guarantee no-nonsense must beautiful.

125
02:15:58,828 --> 02:16:10,580
If you do it in a proper dignified manner any dance 
or any even a drama is very very successful.

126
02:16:10,765 --> 02:16:13,655
Regarding our drama I was, it is an eyeopener

127
02:16:13,703 --> 02:16:18,324
and it is a very bold venture on your part 
to put Ayatollah there.

128
02:16:18,358 --> 02:16:20,091
I mean it was too much.

129
02:16:23,032 --> 02:16:25,408
I don’t know what to say 
because they are all ignorant.

130
02:16:25,433 --> 02:16:28,373
You have to forgive them. 
They are very ignorant

131
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:32,137
and because Quran was written after forty years,

132
02:16:32,185 --> 02:16:36,595
after the death of Mohammed Sahab.

133
02:16:36,645 --> 02:16:41,672
You see there has to be some ambiguity 
means it is ambiguous.

134
02:16:41,712 --> 02:16:44,756
But if you really read through the words,

135
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:49,545
through the lines than you will find.
It is all Sahaja Yoga written.

136
02:16:49,606 --> 02:16:51,806
Absolutely Sahaja Yoga  written there.

137
02:16:51,838 --> 02:16:54,631
But that is what inside you should have

138
02:16:54,656 --> 02:16:57,656
is to  go through the Quran with that inside.

139
02:16:57,681 --> 02:17:00,503
Because we are bringing no credit to go.

140
02:17:00,517 --> 02:17:05,991
Mohammed Sahib no credit to Quran, 
no credit to Islam.

141
02:17:06,067 --> 02:17:11,919
So this is what is happening and
 if we have to save the Muslims,

142
02:17:11,956 --> 02:17:15,501
we have to tell them whatever is the truth.

143
02:17:15,526 --> 02:17:17,838
And it that truth, they can rise.

144
02:17:17,863 --> 02:17:20,130
It is true about Christians also.

145
02:17:20,156 --> 02:17:24,978
It is true about all religions 
that whatever is written

146
02:17:25,042 --> 02:17:27,525
is ambiguous perhaps for all of them.

147
02:17:27,566 --> 02:17:29,496
Because it is in poetry

148
02:17:29,521 --> 02:17:32,794
and so the people don’t understand what is in it.

149
02:17:32,834 --> 02:17:35,301
They don’t understand the meaning of.

150
02:17:35,433 --> 02:17:39,482
For example, we have a very great poet Kabir. 
You know him very well.

151
02:17:39,504 --> 02:17:42,141
Kabir sang a song saying

152
02:17:42,166 --> 02:17:45,188
Sainya nikas gaye, mai na ladi

153
02:17:45,213 --> 02:17:47,318
so sainya means what

154
02:17:47,353 --> 02:17:52,130
sainya means according to 
our Lucknow people it means lover.

155
02:17:52,137 --> 02:17:54,362
What has he got to do with the lover?

156
02:17:54,402 --> 02:17:56,888
See Kabir has nothing to do with the lover.

157
02:17:56,928 --> 02:17:59,208
But said that sainya nikas gaye

158
02:17:59,233 --> 02:18:01,529
So they used to think this about the lover.

159
02:18:01,561 --> 02:18:04,444
But when I told them sainya means life.

160
02:18:04,469 --> 02:18:06,969
They were all shocked. I said it is.

161
02:18:07,009 --> 02:18:08,877
What has he got to do with the lover?

162
02:18:08,902 --> 02:18:13,229
It is life when it went away I didn’t fight it.

163
02:18:13,334 --> 02:18:22,518
Is the whole symbolic expression of Kabir
 is never understood by people

164
02:18:22,621 --> 02:18:26,073
like he has,

165
02:18:26,192 --> 02:18:31,067
he has said to Kundalini called is "surati".

166
02:18:31,282 --> 02:18:33,750
Surati, surati chadhe kamaan

167
02:18:33,806 --> 02:18:39,628
So what people understood
 that he is talking about tobacco.

168
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:42,970
They made surati as tobacco.

169
02:18:43,029 --> 02:18:45,640
Tobacco’s name is surati in Bihar.

170
02:18:45,706 --> 02:18:47,366
So you can imagine

171
02:18:47,444 --> 02:18:50,645
what Kabir must be thinking in the ...[UNCLEAR]

172
02:18:50,670 --> 02:18:53,497
from where did I write for these stupid people.

173
02:18:53,522 --> 02:18:55,705
But it is ignorance.

174
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:58,287
When the eyes are not open,

175
02:18:58,312 --> 02:19:01,785
you don’t understand what is it.

176
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:09,139
You see a snake in a rope.

177
02:19:10,312 --> 02:19:15,523
The only thing I feel is that it was not written in

178
02:19:15,587 --> 02:19:20,428
absolute prose dry prose, people have misunderstood.

179
02:19:20,453 --> 02:19:24,202
Same about Nanaksa

180
02:19:24,251 --> 02:19:28,676
He has written such a beautiful 
very beautiful thing

181
02:19:28,764 --> 02:19:33,099
and that whole guru Granth Sahab  is nothing but the poems

182
02:19:33,124 --> 02:19:36,882
of all the realized souls.

183
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,717
But in that he has written, again and again,

184
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:43,505
don’t only read the words. 
But read the meaning within the words.

185
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:46,874
But they just go on reading 
one after another you know.

186
02:19:46,908 --> 02:19:50,830
One comes put the [UNCLEAR] finger there
 and [UNCLEAR, stars]

187
02:19:50,941 --> 02:19:53,589
If that is the way you are going to read Quran

188
02:19:53,613 --> 02:19:58,410
or Bible or this Nanaksa but any one of these books

189
02:19:58,435 --> 02:20:00,857
you are going to land up in

190
02:20:00,893 --> 02:20:03,796
where [UNCLEAR, oasis] of stupidity.

191
02:20:03,844 --> 02:20:05,855
That is what was happening to people

192
02:20:05,864 --> 02:20:08,318
that’s why they are misled, they are fighting.

193
02:20:08,343 --> 02:20:12,850
Why should people who believe in God, 
why should they fight?

194
02:20:12,875 --> 02:20:15,110
What is the purpose of that?

195
02:20:15,161 --> 02:20:19,717
So this is what has happened 
and now it is your duty as Sahaja Yogis.

196
02:20:19,742 --> 02:20:23,754
Because you have got the light is your duty
 to explain to them

197
02:20:23,794 --> 02:20:26,820
that this is what we have been doing wrong.

198
02:20:26,867 --> 02:20:31,565
And we all miss out if we don’t take to Sahaja Yoga.  
We all miss out.

199
02:20:31,605 --> 02:20:36,427
So the best thing is to have patient,

200
02:20:36,452 --> 02:20:40,058
have love and compassion for people for the blind.

201
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:45,549
And then explain to them very sweetly
 what you have followed.

202
02:20:45,969 --> 02:20:49,536
You are the people who have been 
called as imams.

203
02:20:49,576 --> 02:20:52,732
You are imams you are no less than imam.

204
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:56,210
Imams also didn’t know so much about kundalini

205
02:20:56,238 --> 02:20:59,571
or about the ascent and all that.

206
02:20:59,573 --> 02:21:03,511
Except for Mohammad Sahib himself 
has described mirage.

207
02:21:03,536 --> 02:21:05,865
That too in a such a symbolic manner.

208
02:21:05,914 --> 02:21:08,652
That anybody who reads it will think

209
02:21:08,676 --> 02:21:11,297
that will sit on a white horse

210
02:21:11,322 --> 02:21:14,487
and go towards the sky. 
It is not like that.

211
02:21:14,997 --> 02:21:16,998
You see they are symbolic people.

212
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,518
That’s why I always avoid symbols.

213
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:25,158
Because I know human beings will not understand symbols.

214
02:21:25,183 --> 02:21:29,536
This is the way they express to 
make it beautiful also

215
02:21:29,553 --> 02:21:32,626
people are so angry for

216
02:21:32,668 --> 02:21:35,073
listening to anything that is truthful.

217
02:21:35,113 --> 02:21:38,290
That they wanted to put it in a very sweet manner

218
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:41,062
and this way.
Everybody has done that.

219
02:21:41,891 --> 02:21:43,766
Gyaneshwara such a powerful man.

220
02:21:43,798 --> 02:21:44,758
 [UNCLEAR, He took].

221
02:21:44,782 --> 02:21:46,433
They all use symbols.

222
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:49,725
 And because of the symbols, people are confused

223
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:52,456
and some people have taken advantage of that.

224
02:21:52,481 --> 02:21:55,706
So what we have to now tell them,

225
02:21:55,731 --> 02:21:58,790
that this is a symbol of what.

226
02:21:58,815 --> 02:22:02,673
Explain to them. 
This is symbolic meaning what.

227
02:22:02,714 --> 02:22:05,598
And then I am sure I am very sure,

228
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:10,070
they will take to the right path 
and follow the right path.

229
02:22:10,112 --> 02:22:14,772
All the Sufis also write poetry.
 This gentleman also writes poetry.

230
02:22:14,844 --> 02:22:16,936
All of them write poetry you see.

231
02:22:16,954 --> 02:22:20,010
The poetry is very beautiful to enjoy like flowers.

232
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:24,434
But if it goes into the head of the people
 then it is of use.

233
02:22:24,452 --> 02:22:26,922
It doesn’t, doesn’t.

234
02:22:27,032 --> 02:22:32,267
So you have to talk just like your mother 
is a very [UNCLEAR, prozac]

235
02:22:32,301 --> 02:22:36,477
straight forward way and explain to people.

236
02:22:36,533 --> 02:22:40,956
But among yourself, you can use music poetry everything.

237
02:22:41,044 --> 02:22:44,341
I am very thankful to you for this beautiful program

238
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:52,530
you have given now such a variety 
and of such an expression of art.

239
02:22:52,652 --> 02:22:56,742
I don’t know what to say.
 I never expected all this

240
02:22:56,752 --> 02:22:59,540
and in Turkey, I never expected at least.

241
02:22:59,565 --> 02:23:03,454
So much work has been done in Turkey I didn’t know.

242
02:23:03,505 --> 02:23:09,425
This is all thanks to Nese I think or to Selim

243
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:12,674
and all these people have done so much,

244
02:23:12,706 --> 02:23:16,676
so much to create so many Sahaja Yogis here.

245
02:23:17,358 --> 02:23:21,450
I am happy people have come all the way from

246
02:23:21,491 --> 02:23:28,632
Kiev and also from Romania and from all over to celebrate

247
02:23:28,991 --> 02:23:35,779
this great occasion of I should say

248
02:23:35,845 --> 02:23:38,347
 they call the resurrection of Christ.

249
02:23:38,411 --> 02:23:41,595
Whatever it is shown that you respect

250
02:23:41,654 --> 02:23:45,616
all the religions equally and understand beauty.

251
02:23:45,696 --> 02:23:48,627
This is the biggest achievement I tell you today

252
02:23:48,652 --> 02:23:52,986
in the turmoil of people fighting each other.

253
02:23:54,142 --> 02:23:56,143
So May God Bless You.

254
02:23:56,200 --> 02:24:01,043
Thank you very much. 
Thank you ever so much.

255
02:24:01,261 --> 02:24:04,668
I hope tomorrow they are going to have a havan.

256
02:24:04,684 --> 02:24:08,932
And after that in the “what time is the puja?

257
02:24:10,128 --> 02:24:12,366
Havan?

258
02:24:12,995 --> 02:24:14,772
one o’clock ?

259
02:24:18,796 --> 02:24:22,447
we can have havan later…”

260
02:24:23,107 --> 02:24:26,271
We can have puja at about 7 o’clock they said

261
02:24:26,296 --> 02:24:31,615
and havan in the morning whenever you decide.

262
02:24:33,367 --> 02:24:36,122
10 o’clock, 10 o’clock you can do havan.

263
02:24:36,141 --> 02:24:40,418
And all the negatives, negativity it is
 have to be burn.

264
02:24:40,557 --> 02:24:45,526
So think of them who are the negatives
and who are troubling you.

265
02:24:45,551 --> 02:24:50,271
We have to burn them off. 
We will be alright.

266
02:24:50,321 --> 02:24:51,761
May God Bless You.

267
02:24:53,811 --> 02:25:00,816
I am especially thankful to our guest 
and his wife for being with us.

268
02:25:00,841 --> 02:25:02,223
So very kind of you.

269
02:25:02,248 --> 02:25:05,081
You know we Sahaja Yogis no sense of time.

270
02:25:05,137 --> 02:25:06,692
We are beyond time

271
02:25:06,725 --> 02:25:10,950
And you want sitting till tomorrow morning 
if I don’t move from here.

272
02:25:11,133 --> 02:25:15,797
So now this is a special,

273
02:25:16,163 --> 02:25:20,723
2:30 is too much I think.
Thank you very much
