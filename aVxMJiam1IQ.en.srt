1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,911
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

2
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:28,740
It must open more and more and more

3
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,651
and should not suddenly collapse,

4
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:35,691
again open, again collapse.

5
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:45,313
 It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

6
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:48,745
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

7
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:52,181
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

8
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:56,094
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

9
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,248
I'm very nervous about that."

10
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,049
Another person will come and tell Me,

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,273
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

12
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:11,231
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

13
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:22,817
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

14
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,365
within us,

15
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,776
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

16
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:33,056
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

17
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:36,327
What is this pendulum?

18
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:42,485
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

19
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,345
it is a lotus.

20
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:53,939
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,022
the attention that moves from left to right,

22
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:02,559
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

23
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:14,779
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

24
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:23,846
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

25
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:28,172
then the heavens open within yourself.

26
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:41,004
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

27
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:44,817
creates that subtle opening, by which

28
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:48,939
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,877
your brain.

30
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:57,823
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

31
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:01,392
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

32
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:05,915
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

33
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:09,999
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,067
the Divine doesn't bother.

35
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:23,488
So it is you who has to achieve that state

36
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:29,157
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

37
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:36,418
In that there is just progression.

38
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:40,357
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

39
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,972
If somebody is still

40
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,902
going up and down, up and down,

41
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:51,298
he should know he is still not up to the point

42
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:55,089
and he should face up to himself

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,470
and tell himself or herself that

44
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:06,166
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

45
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:10,085
where I do not come down."

46
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:15,605
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

47
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:21,985
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

48
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:33,474
They are not going to be saved.

49
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:37,896
They will be punished.

50
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:43,662
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

51
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:48,511
but they will not occupy

52
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:53,204
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

53
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:59,708
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

54
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,355
Do not blame any circumstance.

55
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:12,535
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

56
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,750
There's no need to blame anyone.

57
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:22,685
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

58
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,018
What is the matter with you?

59
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,427
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

60
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,846
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

61
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,132
so dominating?

62
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:44,281
That means - what is your level?
