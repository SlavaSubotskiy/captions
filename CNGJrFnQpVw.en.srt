1
00:00:00,844 --> 00:00:05,208
Shri Vijay Merchant, Mr. Rakure,

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:10,232
all the Sahaja Yogis who have come here

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,259
to express their love for Me

4
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:20,330
and all the rest of the people who are in the search of truth.

5
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:28,129
It was really a very gracious of Shri Merchant to come

6
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,597
and inaugurate this book.

7
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:37,693
I have been from My childhood watching his cricket.

8
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:40,853
I must say I’m quite a big cricket fan Myself.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,449
I think cricket is the game which is really Sahaja,

10
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,528
between one extreme of football and

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,297
another boring game of golf.

12
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:56,225
And I always have been appreciating the way he has been

13
00:00:56,494 --> 00:01:00,431
managing our teams and has been such a good captain to our country

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,169
and I’ve been admiring him,

15
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,542
the way he has been able to handle

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,045
the glory in the field of cricket.

17
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:08,402
Even after that,

18
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,092
instead of wasting his life like all other

19
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:14,056
successful people of this life in retirement,

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,699
he’s doing such a great work,

21
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,651
and such a feeling he has for all the

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,471
downtrodden and the poor people of this country

23
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:24,544
shows that he is a very sensitive personality.

24
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:30,098
I’m very thankful to him the way he is

25
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:33,948
being kind to all of us and have been here

26
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:37,658
and spoke to us about his own work.

27
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,483
I agree with him entirely that the downtrodden

28
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,913
or the ones who are not so well off as we

29
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:51,538
are or, we can say, the one who is not such a good batsman,

30
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:55,714
the weaker one, has to be helped and sustained by the stronger one.

31
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:59,133
This is exactly what we are doing in Sahaja Yoga.

32
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:02,952
What we are doing in Sahaja Yoga is that

33
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,699
we are reaching to the roots of poverty.

34
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:09,705
We are not just trying to do the, do the patchwork of

35
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:14,391
just improving the material conditions of people.

36
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,082
Because you have seen in the world people there

37
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,582
have been very affluent

38
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:22,899
in the countries like Switzerland
and Sweden where people are very affluent

39
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:26,453
and they are committing suicide. The maximum number of suicides

40
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,136
are coming from Sweden.

41
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:30,950
I’ve informed you last time that we had some

42
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,680
people coming from Sweden  and their vibrations

43
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,168
were something like the dead bodies.

44
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:41,328
We have to know the roots of our troubles first of all.

45
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:45,478
If we just try to treat the symptoms we cannot go too far.

46
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:48,794
And maybe that we may cure one symptom

47
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,634
but may cure another symptom.

48
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,935
I’ll give you a very simple example of My husband’s

49
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:59,623
sensitivity to his organization which is World Shipping Corporation

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,840
He is another philanthropic gentleman and

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,586
he wanted to do a lot of good

52
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:09,274
for the drivers who were in the organization.

53
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,594
And he said, “Their pay is very little,

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,967
and the women and the men are really living

55
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,401
in substandard conditions.

56
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,219
We must do something about them.

57
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,258
” And so he started raising their pay.

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,510
After three months or so suddenly I had a call

59
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,634
from a lady. She said, “We are

60
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,039
the wives of the drivers and we want to come and see You.

61
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,899
” I said, “It’s a good idea. You all must

62
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,337
 come and see Me,” because in Shipping Corporation

63
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,285
I always had a very motherly

64
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,375
role towards all the employees,

65
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:44,192
and they would always come and tell Me if they thought that

66
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,526
it would be difficult to talk to My husband.

67
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,995
Now they came round and they told Me that,

68
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,839
“It’s nice that he has given us lot of pay,

69
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:55,764
but do our drivers know how to handle that additional money?

70
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:58,430
Now they have taken to drinking, they have taken to

71
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,804
bad women and they are not even giving us

72
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,781
money what they were giving us.”

73
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,907
What is the basic root of poverty?

74
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:07,048
It is not God.

75
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,351
It is human beings,

76
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:13,033
the human beings who have got too much ambitions,

77
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:18,632
human beings who are all the time running after the mirage of money

78
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:24,407
In money-oriented societies of the West have created this kind of

79
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:30,047
mentality, even in the East where people
want to have everything of the world.

80
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,262
They want to have today the house, tomorrow the car,

81
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:34,811
day after tomorrow the helicopter.

82
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:39,105
Maybe they may like to have even a big jumbo jet to themselves.

83
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,484
How do you curb this?

84
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,627
Unless and until you bring those people

85
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,449
who are en-massing these money too much

86
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,123
and extracting the money from the poor

87
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:54,796
and on the other hand the poor who do not feel responsible enough

88
00:04:55,025 --> 00:05:00,462
to create work for themselves and not to be parasites on anyone.

89
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:03,772
These two factors must to be tackled at the same time,

90
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,724
and Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can win.

91
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:10,409
Now you must have seen that in Sahaja Yoga

92
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:14,727
mostly the people of about middle class people are there.

93
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,757
Very poor people are also there;

94
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,670
we have lots of poor people from the villages.

95
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,416
In the Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises

96
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:26,929
you get your own power within yourselves

97
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,072
by which you feel satisfied,

98
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,205
and this too much of hankering after money,

99
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:36,153
position and all that dies out and such a person himself

100
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:38,312
thinks of the others who are around,

101
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,534
because on his vibrations he can feel

102
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,632
and he can feel the needs of others.

103
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,227
As far the sick that are poor or sick who are the rich,

104
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:52,852
even diseases like cancer and leprosy can

105
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,865
only be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

106
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,375
We treat people without taking a single pie.

107
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,708
We have cured thousands of people

108
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,301
all over the world without taking a single pie from them,

109
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,674
whether they are poor, rich or anything.

110
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,624
Mentally there are many people who are disturbed.

111
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:15,303
For example, most of the money of the poor goes for drinking.

112
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,670
They drink like fishes.

113
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,630
They waste their energy in drinking.

114
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:23,386
You might think I am talking on prohibition,

115
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,593
but drinking is against human sustenance.

116
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,494
Now you cannot ask people to stop drinking.

117
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,160
It’s an impossibility. If you tell anybody

118
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:35,111
that, “You stop drinking,” he cannot stop.

119
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,591
Most of the poor people so-called poor, sometimes I feel

120
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:41,639
have lots of money to waste on drinking.

121
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,226
We must see to the other side of the poor also.

122
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:46,154
By giving them more money,

123
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,536
are we really making them responsible,

124
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,776
are we making them better people,

125
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,245
are we making them good citizens

126
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,840
and are we making them one with the divine force?

127
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,075
So supposing a poor man comes to you and he is a drinking fellow.

128
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,170
Now you cannot tell him, “Don’t drink.

129
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,939
” If you tell him, “Don’t drink,” he’ll hit you hard.

130
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,280
If there are ten more, that’s more danger,

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,925
and such prohibition has never worked.

132
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:18,067
But you’ll be amazed to know that in the Amart Nagar district

133
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,932
there are thousands of people

134
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,440
who have just given up drinking just like that

135
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:24,153
by getting this realization.

136
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:29,098
Now what is realization? If we understand in one stroke

137
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:32,289
you will know that this is what we should have first

138
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,739
and then other things should follow.

139
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:39,612
Is that you by realization you get to know yourself.

140
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,681
You get to know your own powers, which are again within.

141
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:47,063
You get to know what are you

142
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,751
and you get to know the absolute.

143
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,571
As you said, is very true;

144
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,436
without getting to Self-realization, you will not

145
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,858
know what is really right and what is wrong.

146
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,103
There cannot be any absolute value

147
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,845
because you have not yet discovered your absolute.

148
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:04,718
Everything is relative. That’s why there is a confusion.

149
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:07,848
But supposing you discover, supposing I say,

150
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,555
keep it as a hypothesis, you discover your Spirit, the absolute.

151
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,309
If you discover that

152
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,412
then relative whatever are the problems you know

153
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:20,912
through the vibrations that are flowing through you,

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,982
you can make out whether it is right or wrong.

155
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,422
If it is wrong the vibrations will stop immediately.

156
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,398
I’ve been saying that cancer cannot be cured

157
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,850
by anything else but Sahaja Yoga

158
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,350
and we have cured cancer of so many people.

159
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,830
The other day I went to Saskar and you know there were

160
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:42,433
lots of sick people around.

161
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,822
Out of them was a blind man from the year

162
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,814
when he was five years, and for about

163
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,488
twenty-five years he has been a blind person.

164
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:53,721
His both the pupils were turned upside down

165
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:57,086
and he could not see anything; he could only see the white retina.

166
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,729
And he started seeing within ten minutes time.

167
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,054
If you want to write you can write to the President’s sister

168
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:05,419
and ask the secretary, Mr. Madapa.

169
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:08,569
There I have also cured our President, no doubt,

170
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,324
but apart from that there was a little girl

171
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:15,323
who was the daughter of a sentry who was a Muslim gentleman.

172
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,330
And he called and he said that,

173
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,244
“This girl cannot see at all, Mother,

174
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,783
and she’s a young girl of seven-eight years

175
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:25,139
and she’s lost her eye sight because there was a fire.

176
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,341
”She also within five or ten minutes started seeing

177
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,767
so clearly that she saw My husband’s suit

178
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,737
which had white lines on it.

179
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,854
Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can solve the

180
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,997
troubles of the downtrodden.

181
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:40,994
There’s no other way out

182
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,021
because unless and until you are realized

183
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:48,273
you have, must have seen how these social workers react.

184
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,529
I have also been in the social work

185
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,636
and I have seen their reaction, how they behave.

186
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,450
Because they are imperfect.

187
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,250
Till this instrument is put to the mains,

188
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,985
this cannot work out properly.

189
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:01,241
It is still an imperfect instrument.

190
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,258
You must get the instrument perfected.

191
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,658
It’s all ready. The instrument is within you;

192
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,643
it is just to be perfected.

193
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:11,841
All your diseases can be cured.

194
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,244
Now what about poverty?

195
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,385
Poverty, as you know is the Lakshmi tattwa.

196
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:18,378
It resides in your Nabhi.

197
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:20,914
The Lakshmi tattwa resides in your Nabhi

198
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:24,473
and if your Nabhi chakra is cured, your Lakshmi tattwa is cured.

199
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,878
In our country because of black magic,

200
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,473
because of horrible gurus,

201
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,678
because of all kinds of

202
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:37,827
bad things we think about others as far as Nabhi is concerned,

203
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,728
because of fasting, nonsensical fasting,

204
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,420
because of going to temples and taking bad prasadas,

205
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:49,580
all these things have caused the augmentation of the Nabhi chakra.

206
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:52,113
Now here the Sahaja Yogis who have come

207
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:55,299
have definitely gained materially.

208
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,201
All of them have gained materially.

209
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,409
If there is anybody can stand up and tell Me, “We have not gained.”

210
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:02,810
We have had very poor people coming to us.

211
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,957
We had one gentleman coming to us from Kalwa.

212
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:12,188
He told Me, “Mother, since I have joined this Sahaja Yoga

213
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:16,053
I’m very well off.” I was surprised because every time he would

214
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,668
come from Kalwa bring Me a garland.

215
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,142
I said, “What happened?”

216
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:23,767
He said, “I don’t know but I was walking on the soil

217
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,931
of my land every morning

218
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:31,006
and suddenly one day a gentleman came to me and told me

219
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,520
that, ‘Will you please sell me your

220
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,816
this clay from your land,

221
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,653
at such and such price?’ Because it’s a very good clay,

222
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,728
very good fabric make.

223
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,010
And he started paying me such a lot. ”

224
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,292
“Perhaps you do not realize, sir,

225
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:52,023
that these vibrations are dynamic, are blessings of God

226
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:55,796
and once you touch them the Lakshmi tattwa improves just like that.

227
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:59,559
”You don’t have to bother to look after the downtrodden or anything

228
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:03,540
Anybody, whether he is rich or whether he is poor,

229
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:07,593
when he comes to Sahaja Yoga he gets related to the whole.

230
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:12,799
This sensitivity in all the people who are doing work,

231
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,974
good work for helping the poor,

232
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,566
becomes really enlightened.

233
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,310
Only by touching a thing you can cure people.

234
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:21,646
By just standing there you can stop accidents.

235
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,226
By just thinking about it you can manage the whole show.

236
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,332
It is that is how, by going deeper into it,

237
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,665
with a deeper being, that is the whole, the Viraat,

238
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,985
you learn that you are a part of the whole.

239
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:38,341
Only you have to be connected; the dynamic starts flowing in.

240
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:41,280
But of course you cannot become very rich in Sahaja Yoga,

241
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,226
neither very poor, because

242
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:46,305
as in the nature these imbalances are never there.

243
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:50,973
The other day I told you a human being grows up to, say,
certain height to five, six, seven feet;

244
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,219
that’s all, not more.

245
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,054
Even the, say, a mango tree grows up to a certain point.

246
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,517
The nature looks after.

247
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:57,628
God looks after you.

248
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:58,742
He does everything.

249
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:00,667
Let us be connected only to God

250
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,717
and He looks after this.

251
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:07,355
I agree that philanthropic work is a very essential part

252
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,069
of a country like ours.

253
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:13,395
But we have to know that philanthropy is not the job of God.

254
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:16,406
Human beings have created poverty.

255
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,845
Human beings have created all these problems.

256
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,360
So they should solve their own problems. It is not the work of God.

257
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,355
God’s work is to bless you, to gift you.

258
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,811
When you go to Him, when you enter into the Kingdom of God,

259
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,847
He blesses you. Not too much, not too less,

260
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,937
but the satisfaction and the, and the joy of owning it.

261
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,760
Actually, we do not own anything.

262
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,788
Whatever we own, so-called, is just a myth in our minds.

263
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,122
Even in our poor people

264
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:48,777
we have given them sometimes very wrong ideas,

265
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,924
and they have formed the sort of
a group thinking they are very poor

266
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,772
and they can assert a political pressure and all sorts of things.

267
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,547
You have to be careful

268
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,826
that when we want to do something for the poor,

269
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,406
let us do it from the within and not from the without.

270
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:07,370
Actually, this is such a wonderful country.

271
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,206
Here you don’t need much.

272
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:13,435
You have seen Me: I can sleep on the street;
I can move about [anywhere / any way] I like.

273
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,960
There is no need to have too much.

274
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,912
That’s why Gandhiji always said that we should press on our sagara.

275
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:25,303
He told all the gandhivad, Gandhi, gandhian people
that you should have less.

276
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,032
But what you find, most of the gandhivadis have

277
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:29,993
the greatest amount of black money,

278
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:33,872
the greatest amount of diamonds and the greatest amount of money.

279
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:38,282
They might wear ordinary clothes but I have heard they are not.

280
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,673
This heart has to be changed.

281
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,694
Unless and until you change the heart of the people,

282
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:50,111
unless and until sincerely they really feel the way you feel,

283
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,176
not only that but they just

284
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,965
feel it as an actual feeling within themselves.

285
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:57,940
For example, if there’s a poor man standing before Me,

286
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:00,934
immediately I can feel his Nabhi chakra.

287
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:03,938
I can put My hand on Nabhi chakra. I can solve his problem,

288
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,589
just like this. It’s a fact; you know that.

289
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:10,478
All the Sahaja Yogis who are
here most of them are Sahaja Yogis will

290
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,562
say that Mataji has done.

291
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,648
The poorest of poorest

292
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,421
can be touched by Lakshmi tattwa and can be cured.

293
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,511
That is the most important part,

294
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:22,463
that his Lakshmi tattwa must be cured

295
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,566
and not his money or materia.

296
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,415
Now the difference between Lakshmi tattwa and materia

297
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,693
you must find out. Lakshmi tattwa is a person.

298
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:32,602
He may be just an ordinary driver,

299
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,318
but he can be like a batcha.

300
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,236
You see, we had a driver with us for many years.

301
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:38,682
He was just like a batcha,

302
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,865
and I knew that he was like a king

303
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:43,288
because he was a king in his previous life.

304
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:49,523
The way he was like a batcha,

305
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,300
that nothing would disturb him

306
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,248
and everything would satisfy him.

307
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:57,176
If you tell him that you have to wait for three hours he’ll wait.

308
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,633
If you tell him he cannot

309
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:01,794
stay here now, you can go and sleep anywhere, he’ll do.

310
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,890
Whatever you tell him he will not hesitate

311
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,428
and he was such a happy personality.

312
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:10,078
Now, the reason is, I would say he’s better than many rich

313
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,077
people who cannot sleep in the night

314
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,869
and who are all the time thinking about dirty tricks that

315
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,322
they are going to try and many of these politicians

316
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,185
who are just planning all the time all the dirty designs.

317
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,422
We have to purify ourselves from within.

318
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:27,414
Poverty is just a mere myth of that symptom.

319
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,532
Now to say that people are very much tortured,

320
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:36,656
I know that they are being, of course, very much put down.

321
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:39,950
But what is the solution you have?

322
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,263
If the solution is to give them some money,

323
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:45,767
or to have them money wise or to just put little cure,

324
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,701
that is not going to help.

325
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,239
You have to awaken their Lakshmi tattwa.

326
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,579
I am going to the essence, to the base of it,

327
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,586
from where the problem comes in.

328
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,344
Lakshmi stands with one hand like this,

329
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:00,686
one hand like this and with two kamala in Her hand

330
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:06,175
and She is a woman with a very simple sari, white sari.

331
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:11,000
Be sure a Lakshmi pati, a person who has got Lakshmi,

332
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:16,337
the satisfaction of Lakshmi has always a way of giving.

333
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,434
All the time he is giving.

334
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:20,508
If the Lakshmi tattwa

335
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:24,059
of all these so-called multi-millionaires is awakened

336
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,691
they will be frightened of keeping all these black money with them

337
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:30,931
and extracting the blood of the poor.

338
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:34,970
If the Lakshmi tattwa of the poor is enlightened

339
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,569
they’ll be ashamed of begging and being parasites.

340
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:43,760
No use developing parasite tendencies into them.

341
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,527
A parasite is to be hated like leprosy.

342
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,910
In this country we have had enough of this beggary.

343
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,933
Our leaders also have become greatest beggars of the world.

344
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:58,690
All over the world if you go, you feel so ashamed.

345
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,619
It does not matter if half of this country is damned

346
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:07,049
because they can be born again. But live with your self-respect.

347
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,632
This kind of beggary that is

348
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:13,117
on and this kind of begging that we are doing with other countries

349
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:16,472
is so shameful for us because God has given us

350
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,508
such a blessing of this yoga bhoomi.

351
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,461
What a mess we have made out of it

352
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:24,290
by not understanding our own values, our own

353
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:28,242
culture and our own heritage that we have got from God.

354
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,934
This is the only country in the whole world which is yoga-oriented.

355
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:34,295
Do you understand the importance of this country?

356
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:38,082
Not only that it is yoga-oriented but also,

357
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:43,122
also it is a punya bhoomi. Here all
the great saints have come and lived.

358
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,844
Even Zoroaster whom Parsees worship is nothing but an incarnation

359
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:52,002
of Datattreya, and you know how we worship him in our

360
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,830
Sahaja Yoga, how we worship Mohamed Sahib in our Sahaja Yoga,

361
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,244
how we understand where He stands within us.

362
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:03,674
The deeper, the intercurrence of all these problems

363
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,899
of the whole world can be solved by you people, the Indians.

364
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:11,908
You are being blessed to be Indians in this country

365
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:17,133
and not to feel so bad if you don’t have
one helicopter or one transistor.

366
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:23,014
Poverty is of the mind, I can tell you. It’s not more of

367
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:27,022
eating or non-eating. If a person has a mind which is sickening

368
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:31,250
he may be the multi-millionaire still he’ll be crying,
“I don’t have this. I don’t have that.”

369
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,941
Nothing can satisfy human beings,

370
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,266
and you know the economics law is such that,

371
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:40,669
“No want is satiable in general.”

372
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:46,004
In particular, everything is satisfied but nobody is satisfied.

373
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,899
With Sahaja Yoga you can give them satisfaction

374
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:53,938
and self-respect. Develop their self-respect.

375
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:55,875
Teach them how to come up,

376
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,067
not to look after them as just downtrodden.

377
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,335
I have had a very good opportunity

378
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,961
of working for a blind school here.

379
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,168
And the blind school people wanted to collect

380
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:10,204
money and this and that and all that, and I said, “Nothing doing.

381
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,088
You are not to make them begging girls.

382
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:14,548
They can all work out something for themselves.”

383
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,009
They started working out.

384
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,410
Then they made some nice things and

385
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,155
bed covers and this and that.

386
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:23,231
So they said, “Now, who will market?” 
I said, “You go all out to do the

387
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:24,600
marketing for them.”

388
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,081
But then I told them that in Japan I was surprised

389
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,779
that the blind were taught massage.

390
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:35,493
I said, “You give them realization and let them do massage.

391
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,037
If a realized blind person gives massaging,

392
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:41,060
all these foreigners

393
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,906
would be paying  them at least hundred rupees per massage, minimum.

394
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:49,165
And if that person is blind it’s much easier to do the massage.”

395
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:51,585
But the people could not accept this kind of a thing.

396
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:55,038
They said, “No, no, Mataji, then, 
You see, You should not give them realization.”

397
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:59,237
Here we lack the understanding of the depth of our problem.

398
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,098
They, they said, “Mataji, how can You give realization

399
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,421
to these blind [too/people]?”

400
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,745
And the blind people would have got it in no time.

401
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:09,773
Only they could have been cured 
and they would have had this realization.

402
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,513
But because that organization belongs

403
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,747
to other great people of great thinking and wisdom

404
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,545
they would not accept such a situation

405
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:22,744
where I would say, “All right, you bring all your blind 
and I’ll try to give them their eyesight.”

406
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,958
They are not willing to accept this.

407
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,517
I will tell you a very simple example that

408
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:30,533
I cured a leukemia of a little boy of

409
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,065
ten years who was a patient of blood,

410
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:35,291
blood cancer patient in Delhi.

411
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:38,672
Of course, we never charge a single pie.

412
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,212
No Sahaja Yogis allow to charge

413
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:44,598
a single pie for whatever he does; you know that.

414
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,382
Not a single pie.

415
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:49,500
And this boy was cured. He was brought by Doctor Mulher,

416
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,262
and Doctor Mulher referred Me to the medical institute.

417
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:56,457
The medical institute came to Me

418
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,975
and just see what was their proposition,

419
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,409
“You give us the list of people whom You have cured,

420
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,722
how You have cured, where they live and all.”

421
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:07,056
I said, “For what? I’m not asking for any money.

422
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:10,012
Nothing is selling here. You are as if you are

423
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,662
going into cross-examination,

424
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,193
as if I am out here for any donation from you.

425
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:19,348
You just come and see for yourselves. I don’t write the names of

426
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:23,000
people whom I give food or how many morsels they have eaten.

427
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:24,964
This is My love that is flowing.

428
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:26,670
It’s My love that is working out.

429
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,317
You people can’t understand love.

430
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:32,278
You want Me to write down all the people I have cured. 
I refuse to do it.

431
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:35,015
This is the way they look at a thing.

432
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:38,401
They do not know the power of love for us now.

433
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,987
It is necessary first to generate the power of love

434
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,911
through Sahaja Yoga. It is very easy. 
Sahaja Yoga is not the blessing

435
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:52,428
of one year or one yuga but of all the yugas.

436
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,353
You have to get it.

437
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:57,302
You have to get to know your Atma.

438
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,474
You have to know your Self,

439
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,006
and the Last Judgment is here now.

440
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,587
There is no need to think of another Last Judgment coming in.

441
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,556
Here, now, by knowing your Atma

442
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:11,275
you will get the power of God flowing through you,

443
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,318
like when I put it to the mains,

444
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,516
the power starts flowing through us.

445
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,801
And then this power can communicate that dynamic power.

446
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,936
What is this poverty? It’s at the Feet of that Lord.

447
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,662
You can just throw it away.

448
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:28,782
I agree that going to temples and churches there is no God.

449
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:31,756
But even going to poor

450
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:35,147
will not help, I can tell you this much today,

451
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,621
but going to the roots of poverty,

452
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,061
by understanding why there is poverty

453
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,781
and why human beings behave like this.

454
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,665
You have to transform the whole thing.

455
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:47,797
You are still in the flower state. You all have to become fruits.

456
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,616
All of us have to become fruits today.

457
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,801
If we are not fruits we cannot

458
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:56,825
solve the problem of our country and of another country.

459
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,028
If this takes place,

460
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:04,126
if this tremendous transformation takes place in our country today,

461
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,269
then the whole world

462
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:10,546
is going to be led by us, and in any case it is going to be led,

463
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,025
which I am sure, hundred per cent sure,

464
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:16,907
that the time it’s coming when 
the whole world will have to listen to us

465
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:19,086
on this point to solve their problems.

466
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:21,665
There are countries, communist countries are there;

467
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:24,820
people have everything. I’ve been to all the countries. 
I’ve been to Russia.

468
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,359
Those who talk of communism should go to Russia

469
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,582
and see for themselves.

470
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:31,102
Those who talk of capitalism should go to America

471
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:35,546
and see for themselves how stupid 
and silly and useless people they have been,

472
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,772
how their society is finished.

473
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,070
Money cannot bring you happiness.

474
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:42,286
If you want to make people happy

475
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:46,175
then awaken their Nabhi chakra, as they call it,

476
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:48,080
or you can call it the Lakshmi tattwa.

477
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,441
And the Lakshmi tattwa can only be awakened,

478
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,007
only be awakened through Sahaja Yoga

479
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:55,996
by which the whole country will be transformed.

480
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,647
Like you go to a barren garden

481
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:02,338
and you see the garden absolutely in a barren condition.

482
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:07,199
Suddenly water comes in and the power of the water generates

483
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:11,973
all that affluence, and suddenly you find the whole place

484
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:15,306
bubbling with joy, and that’s what is going to happen

485
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:19,017
to this our country, which people think as to be poor.

486
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:21,775
Still I would say we may be poor outwardly

487
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,570
because we don’t have very good

488
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:26,844
clothes maybe, according to them, 
and we don’t have too many plastics with us.

489
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:30,435
What is their affluence? It’s nothing but plastics and rubbers.

490
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:33,451
They eat plastics and they sleep on rubbers.

491
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,960
They don’t even have so much of natural cotton with them.

492
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:45,658
Our affluence is our yoga, is our power, our sustenance,

493
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:50,530
our humanity, and our humanity has to be sustained.

494
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:54,379
We have to have many more people like Mr. Vijay Merchant

495
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:57,970
who think of the whole, of the all the people who are suffering,

496
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,006
but philanthropy of Sahaja Yoga is different

497
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:04,515
because for Me who is the other?

498
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,663
When somebody is just a part and parcel of My being,

499
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,460
itself my finger is paining; I’m just rubbing it

500
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,424
and I must do it.

501
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:16,610
For that I don’t have to awaken people; they just get it.

502
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:19,047
You just stand near a person, you get a headache

503
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,611
and you ask the person, “Have you got a headache?” “Yes.”

504
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:24,206
You rub your head and rub his head and just finish it off.

505
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:30,418
You just cannot help it because the macrocosm, the Viraat,

506
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,219
informs you when you are one with it that, “see, the other fellow

507
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,130
is suffering. ” You become that.

508
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,803
You become collectively conscious. It is not a lecture or anything

509
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:47,395
but it’s a becoming within you 
that you start feeling on your fingers,

510
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,973
on your fingertips, what are the centers catching,

511
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,731
what is the problem of the other person,

512
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:56,263
how to cure it, what to do it. Everything, all this knowledge

513
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:59,279
is given in Sahaja Yoga, absolutely free.

514
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,869
Out of so many who are sitting here

515
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,331
you can ask how many have been suffering from diseases

516
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,029
have been cured completely,

517
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:11,366
and since they have been realized 
not a single pie has been given to the doctors.

518
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:15,176
It is not necessary to look after your health,

519
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:18,092
not necessary to do much about it.

520
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,592
We have had people who have had three heart attacks

521
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:22,497
and now they are going strong.

522
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:24,672
We have had people who had leukemia,

523
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:26,577
who had all kinds of diseases. Today

524
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:28,839
you won’t believe they ever had that disease

525
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:32,378
because now the inside is completely into balance,

526
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:36,894
integrated and blessed by God’s divine power within you.

527
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:38,930
This is our heritage.

528
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,279
We have to cash on it.

529
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,958
And by this only we are going to remove the poverty,

530
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:47,719
one day you will see, and not by patching up few things.

531
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,410
I would request Mr. Vijay Merchant and we have another

532
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,676
great social worker with us, is Gidubai Kotak,

533
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:59,021
that you should pay little more attention to our Sahaja Yoga

534
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:01,442
and see the dynamics of the Sahaja Yoga.

535
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:05,291
You’ll be amazed how one person, the person who spoke to you

536
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,496
just now, was from Rahuri, these two persons.

537
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:11,918
They have given realization to ten thousands people.

538
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:15,172
Just go and see their houses. Just go and see their children.

539
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:17,671
They are bubbling with joy, with happiness,

540
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:21,034
and you do not see any poverty in their hearts at all.

541
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,892
Their hearts have been enriched and they are doing so well.

542
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,915
Because the energy comes within you,

543
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,534
the Saraswati tattwa is also enlightened

544
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,253
and you start thinking as to what is to be done

545
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:34,824
and how to, how to make your life happy.

546
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,936
But money is not everything;

547
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:40,353
food is not everything. Unless and until you get

548
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,497
to know your Atma you can never be happy.

549
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:46,672
So go to the roots and it’s so easy. You don’t have to pay anything

550
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,993
You don’t have to have many organization, nothing.

551
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:53,418
It just works, just like this. So why worry and why just

552
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,530
think of something terrible?

553
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,763
Now more we are ahead, talk to Gidubai also

554
00:28:57,922 --> 00:29:00,374
that they were enamored by one guru

555
00:29:00,553 --> 00:29:02,437
who were showing some miracles.

556
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:05,692
And I, I had met somebody from Morvi

557
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:06,854
who came to see Me,

558
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:10,882
and I told him that you just 
don’t have anything to do with this horrible fellow,

559
00:29:11,044 --> 00:29:16,596
because a day will come when Kalki is 
at work and there will be destruction.

560
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:18,473
He wouldn’t listen to Me.

561
00:29:18,712 --> 00:29:21,350
I went to Andhra. For your information I tell you

562
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,909
I went to Andhra. I told to Andhra people that, 
“You don’t grow this tobacco.”

563
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,797
In Andhra there are two types of people:

564
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:32,699
one who are making lots of money; the other are the so-called poor

565
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,664
who are doing lot of black magic.

566
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:36,639
I talked to both of them.

567
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,775
I told them, “Don’t do black magic because if you do black magic

568
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,521
Lakshmi tattwa will disappear.”

569
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,107
If the black magic comes from this side, 
the Lakshmi goes from the other side.

570
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:47,032
And they just didn’t listen to Me.

571
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,627
And I talked to these people who were growing tobacco.

572
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:52,926
They wouldn’t listen. There are on three tapes,

573
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:58,198
there is a lecture, where I said that the sea

574
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,961
is the incarnation of Datattreya.

575
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,091
It will take a respite, I, believe Me.

576
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:07,081
And that’s what has happened with it.

577
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:10,380
We have to understand that God knows all of us.

578
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,476
He knows us in masses,

579
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,828
and He knows where we are going

580
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,609
and what we are doing.

581
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:21,289
Your Bombay has escaped recently a very big drought.

582
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:25,956
But please take heed and take to God.

583
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:28,278
It is no question of going to Himalayas, of course,

584
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:30,545
and no question of running away from it.

585
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:32,793
But get it within yourself,

586
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:36,424
try, as many as you can bring in here,

587
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:40,769
if the saints are there. Those who are Sahaja Yogis are saints.

588
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:45,907
Then God definitely will bless you, definitely will bless you.

589
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:51,435
And the same people who are realized today 
have done tremendous work in the villages.

590
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:55,225
They have emancipated so many villages without any money,

591
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:58,201
without anything. When I go in the villages I’m really surprised

592
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:04,610
how people get cured, how they are helped, how they get energetic,

593
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:08,233
how they understand things. It’s most amazing.

594
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:13,054
So the power of all the powers, that is the power of God’s Love,

595
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:16,756
let us take to it. Let us take advantage of Him

596
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,706
and leave everything in the hands of God.

597
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:23,539
Only get Him into everyone you think who is suffering.

598
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,252
You get Me hundred people who are suffering, I will see to them.

599
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:30,479
Today if the whole hall was filled I would have cured all of them.

600
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,840
You know that I have done it. It is not difficult.

601
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:37,165
It is no boasting. It’s a fact. It’s a fact.

602
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:41,224
It works in five minutes, for so many people can get it.

603
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:44,518
But people do not want to face reality

604
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,592
and they do not want to attend to it.

605
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:49,311
Now we have already so many Sahaja Yogis in Bombay.

606
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,783
So you can imagine I’ve worked here for nine years.

607
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,926
We have some more of course in the outer centers

608
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,704
but here in the center we have so many or little more.

609
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,068
So you can see how people are.

610
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:02,676
And the work you are doing from outside,

611
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:08,172
it’s all like a blind person going doing 
this work, that work, that work, that work.

612
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,811
Politicians also think they are doing great work.

613
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:12,250
All right, they are doing.

614
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,255
Social workers are also doing great work.

615
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:16,854
Everybody’s doing. But there’s no coordination,

616
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,831
there’s no integration and there’s no satisfaction

617
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,350
of what one is doing. The reason is

618
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,327
all of them belong to the one whole

619
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,549
and they have not yet connected with the whole,

620
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,465
which one has to do. We are finding our wholesomeness

621
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,858
all over the world, whether we are Indians, Americans or anything.

622
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,537
We are all just trying to find out our wholesomeness,

623
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:38,036
and the answer is Sahaja Yoga.

624
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:42,213
It is Sahaja Yoga. There’s no other answer

625
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:45,157
to anyone of these problems. Today I am telling you,

626
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,544
again you can tell Me afterwards.

627
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:48,934
You give Me your problems.

628
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,137
You tell Me who are the downtrodden. Let Me see.

629
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:52,922
Let Me see who are the downtrodden.

630
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:55,323
Now you, somebody wanted Me to go and see the fishermen.

631
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,188
I said, “All right, I’ll go and see them.”

632
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,490
I’m sure if I, they get realization,

633
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:03,002
their fishery will improve, definitely, 
hundred per cent; I’m sure of it.

634
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:07,177
Everything improves because God’s blessings are there

635
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,409
and God has got the six qualities which makes Him Bhagwan.

636
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:15,521
It’s one of them is Shubha, Auspicious. Another is Kalyan.

637
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:18,056
Another is Aishwary [GW: Ishwari?].

638
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:20,821
Like these the six qualities of God.

639
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:23,786
These six qualities emit from the being,

640
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:26,500
and once you face it you get it.

641
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:28,213
You want to do Kalyan;

642
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,072
all right, then face people to God,

643
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:32,433
and this is the way by which you can face it.

644
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,707
You don’t have to organize churches and temples or anything.

645
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:41,284
It’s just the energy which has to flow, Shakti that has to flow.

646
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:44,977
Like you can see a wood is lying there, has nothing.

647
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:48,700
But if you enlighten it, it gives you light, fire, everything.

648
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,637
In the same way enlightenment

649
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:52,899
is the only way to solve the problem,

650
00:33:53,018 --> 00:33:57,418
and all of us should try to enlighten as many people as possible.

651
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:03,216
Our work, of course, is more for 
the middle class because the extremes do not take to us.

652
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,498
But when the middle course increases,

653
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:07,263
the river flows on both the sides.

654
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:09,010
She can feed on the both the sides.

655
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:11,906
Gradually the both the sides can also join [them],

656
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:14,656
but the depth is in the center, in the madhya marga,

657
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,223
and there it works out.

658
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,703
It is only the middle class, which can work it out

659
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:20,906
because they have the values necessary,

660
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:22,672
they have the feelings necessary

661
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,529
and they have the blessings necessary

662
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:27,335
because they lead a very normal life.

663
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,272
Once they learn their swimming

664
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:31,494
they must know themselves before helping others.

665
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:34,391
You must help yourself, you must become yourself,

666
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,406
before you help others. Once they achieve that,

667
00:34:37,546 --> 00:34:39,549
they can easy help, easy help others

668
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,269
and that has been done.

669
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,676
It is such a silent work of Sahaja Yoga

670
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,055
that we have not maintain any statistics.

671
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,781
We have not yet been able to say.

672
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,162
Here there are people who have given realization to

673
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:53,317
minimum of ten thousands or eight thousands people.

674
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,725
There are people who have cured thousands of people

675
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,827
who are sitting here just like ordinary people,

676
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:00,209
but they don’t know about it

677
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,630
and they’ll say, “We didn’t do, Mother. It just worked.

678
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,236
It was just happening. It happened.”

679
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:08,240
So this is what is a very dynamic force.

680
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:10,348
I would request all the social workers

681
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:13,707
to open their eyes to this tremendous discovery

682
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,308
that has come to our country

683
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:18,706
and to see for themselves what it is like, what it means.

684
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:22,924
It transforms a personality into such a dynamic web

685
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:26,796
that an ordinary boy can become a great cricket player.

686
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:30,681
An ordinary musician can become a great musician.

687
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,495
An ordinarily dull boy can become a first class student.

688
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:37,784
It has happened.

689
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:41,423
There are many who will say it has happen in their cases.

690
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,815
So many things have happen like this,

691
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:48,181
and so we have to depend on the mercy of God for this.

692
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,455
Only thing is we have to desire and ask for it.

693
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:54,014
I think, the other day I had a talk

694
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:58,955
with one of the political leaders. I said, 
“Politics without adhyatma has no life.”

695
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:03,379
In the same way I’ll say, 
“Social work without adhyatma has no meaning.”

696
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:06,589
Without adhyatma, without the Atma in it,

697
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:09,685
without the Spirit of God in it, you are doing it

698
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:12,027
because in you something is dying,

699
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:15,986
in you something is feeling, that what is feeling in you

700
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,424
is the part of the whole.

701
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,529
So know the whole and you’ll be so dynamic.

702
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,636
You’ll be so great and the whole thing will flow from you

703
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,812
and you can really help thousands of people.

704
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,935
I hope, it’s a good thing today we have two great

705
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,514
social workers here and I put forward to them

706
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:36,260
this kind of a proposition.

707
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:39,276
So on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis we render all our services.

708
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:41,576
Any number of downtrodden people you have got,

709
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:44,732
you send them over to our centers and we’ll see to them.

710
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,095
May God bless you all.
