1
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:14,178
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:24,553
Some of you have found the truth,

3
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:31,178
some of you have not found it fully,

4
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:35,927
and some of you have not found it at all.

5
00:44:37,848 --> 00:44:45,928
But if you look around in today's situation,

6
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:51,671
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

7
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:56,921
Countries after countries are taking

8
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:00,795
to all kinds of wrong things.

9
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:04,171
Lot of cold war is on,

10
00:45:05,546 --> 00:45:07,921
people are killing each other,

11
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:14,546
destroying beautiful places,

12
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:22,296
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

13
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:29,171
They are all human beings created by God.

14
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:32,795
God Almighty has created them

15
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:37,296
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

16
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,296
At this juncture

17
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:46,921
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

18
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:56,796
This is, where have we to reach --or

19
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,795
is it our destiny?

20
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:06,795
Is this the destiny of human beings,

21
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:11,171
to be destroyed by each other

22
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:16,421
for land or for anything else?

23
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:21,171
Think of the whole world as one,

24
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:26,296
and think what's happening all over:

25
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,421
every day we read newspaper,

26
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:34,046
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

27
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:38,546
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

28
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,046
for no rhyme and reason.

29
00:46:45,796 --> 00:46:50,046
We have to think, what is the destiny?

30
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,795
Where are we going?

31
00:46:55,046 --> 00:47:01,171
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

32
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:07,796
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

33
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:13,921
What's wrong with human beings is

34
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:23,795
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

35
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:26,795
I would call it ignorance.

36
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,796
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

37
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:35,671
they are doing these horrible things.

38
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:42,671
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

39
00:47:44,046 --> 00:47:47,546
is nothing but complete destruction.

40
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,421
Is that our destiny,

41
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:55,296
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

42
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:59,171
What good are we doing?

43
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:05,421
Under the name of some sort of nationality

44
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:08,671
or maybe some religion

45
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:13,171
-- all kinds of things which are good --

46
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:16,795
but we are doing all wrong things.

47
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:18,921
Fighting.

48
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:22,671
Fighting is not the only thing.

49
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,421
We hate.

50
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:32,046
Anybody who can excite our hatred

51
00:48:34,546 --> 00:48:39,546
is very much adorable, very much liked,

52
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:43,421
and under his guidance we form groups.

53
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:51,671
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

54
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:56,046
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

55
00:48:57,546 --> 00:49:01,795
And this Last Judgment will really decide

56
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:06,921
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

57
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:11,795
It's a very, very serious thing.

58
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:20,795
All of those who are aware should think about it.

59
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,421
Little patchwork here

60
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,795
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

61
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:29,795
Whatever you may try,

62
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:34,795
unless and until you transform human beings,

63
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:37,171
they cannot be saved.

64
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:46,671
This transformation is not an impossible thing

65
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,296
-- it's not difficult.

66
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:52,795
This is the time for transformation,

67
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:55,795
this is a chance for transformation.

68
00:49:56,171 --> 00:50:02,046
And within us is placed the power,

69
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:06,421
as Tao has described,

70
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:10,046
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

71
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:12,921
All of them have described it,

72
00:50:14,296 --> 00:50:17,421
I'm not the first person to say that;

73
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:23,795
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

74
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:29,795
to understand it or to accept it,

75
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:32,795
that it should happen to you.

76
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:41,795
You are born not only to be human beings,

77
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:45,671
but you have to be superhuman.

78
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,796
You have to enjoy yourself.

79
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,921
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

80
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,421
It should not be a curse:

81
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:59,421
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

82
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,421
That is why you are created.

83
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:08,795
God had no intention of creating people

84
00:51:09,296 --> 00:51:13,296
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

85
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:15,671
how to fight, how to save;

86
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:21,796
but people who will live in complete harmony,

87
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,046
peace and joy.

88
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,171
That's why we are created.

89
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:32,795
That is our destiny -- that is,

90
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:36,046
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

91
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:44,796
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

92
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,921
This transformation is not difficult.

93
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:56,671
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

94
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:00,795
Hindus will go to the temple;

95
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:03,546
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

96
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,296
Christians go to the church;

97
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:08,796
they'll think they have done very good.

98
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:13,171
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

99
00:52:13,795 --> 00:52:15,795
What have they achieved?

100
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:18,671
Face yourself, please.

101
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:22,795
Face your limitations.

102
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,296
Face your tribulations.

103
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:28,796
Face your problems and see for yourself:

104
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:32,171
have you been able to solve your problems?

105
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:41,795
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

106
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:48,796
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

107
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:52,795
who are doing harm, maybe.

108
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,671
That may be the wish of God.

109
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:59,796
But what is your wish?

110
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:02,795
Why don't you think that

111
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:09,546
"I have to be a person who is a store,

112
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:14,921
who is a source of joy and love"?

113
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:21,046
I am not only talking, but I want you all

114
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,671
to get your Self-realization.

115
00:53:24,296 --> 00:53:25,795
What is Self-realization

116
00:53:26,296 --> 00:53:29,795
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

117
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:32,671
You don't know.

118
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:35,796
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

119
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,796
-- can you imagine?

120
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:40,046
You don't know what you are.

121
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:43,671
You don't know that you are the spirit,

122
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:50,421
and that you are the source of knowledge,

123
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,671
of pure knowledge.

124
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:55,671
I find people sitting in a meeting,

125
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:59,546
listening to some babaji

126
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:04,046
who is telling them some story, very happy.

127
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:10,671
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

128
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:14,296
If you want to have reality and truth,

129
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:16,921
then please try to understand

130
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,796
that something has to happen

131
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:23,796
to you, some transformation has to take place.

132
00:54:24,546 --> 00:54:26,795
You are not yet subtle enough,

133
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,171
you haven't got those subtleties,

134
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:31,795
till you reach that point --

135
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:35,796
for which you don't have to leave your family,

136
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:39,046
you don't have to leave your children,

137
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:47,046
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

138
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:50,795
There's no need to do all that.

139
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,921
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

140
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:58,421
and give all that belongs to you to me."

141
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:03,171
It's such a stupid idea.

142
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:07,795
These are emergencies today.

143
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:13,671
We are living in a very emergent conditions

144
00:55:14,046 --> 00:55:15,546
-- try to understand.

145
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:18,046
And I want to warn you

146
00:55:18,546 --> 00:55:20,921
that if you don't go deep into yourself

147
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:24,171
and find out what you are,

148
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:29,296
and take to your transformation,

149
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:31,796
anything is possible.

150
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,171
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

151
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:41,046
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

152
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:45,296
all kinds of national problems are there,

153
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:48,795
all kinds of international problems are there,

154
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:52,171
that people can't help it.

155
00:55:53,421 --> 00:56:00,671
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

156
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:04,046
a personality of truth.

157
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:06,671
We don't know what is the truth is.

158
00:56:08,296 --> 00:56:13,795
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

159
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:17,921
while our eyes are closed.

160
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,796
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

161
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,546
but to make you alert and aware

162
00:56:27,046 --> 00:56:30,296
that human beings have to change.

163
00:56:30,796 --> 00:56:34,796
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

164
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:38,921
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

165
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:42,796
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

166
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:49,546
But when I see the destiny,

167
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:52,921
I don't know how many will be ruined,

168
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:56,046
how many will be finished.

169
00:56:56,671 --> 00:56:58,546
What will happen to them?

170
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:01,171
What diseases they will get,

171
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:04,296
what problems they will get?

172
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:06,921
What will happen to their children,

173
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:10,296
what will happen to their country,

174
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:13,421
and what will happen to the whole world?

175
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:17,671
Just widen your vision.

176
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:23,546
My vision is that all the people of the world

177
00:57:24,046 --> 00:57:26,421
should get transformation.

178
00:57:27,795 --> 00:57:31,671
We have enemies within ourselves,

179
00:57:34,296 --> 00:57:36,171
and when they talk of jihad,

180
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:40,296
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

181
00:57:40,796 --> 00:57:42,796
What are these enemies?

182
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:47,796
These days, the worst is greed.

183
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:51,546
There is greed.

184
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:57,296
With that greed people can do anything they want to

185
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:01,796
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

186
00:58:02,421 --> 00:58:07,421
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

187
00:58:07,796 --> 00:58:12,671
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

188
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:15,921
that you don't even see what you have.

189
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:20,796
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

190
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:24,296
deceive your government,

191
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:28,171
deceive everyone and manage it.

192
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:40,421
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

193
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:45,671
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

194
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:52,421
We develop anger for small things:

195
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:57,796
like you have come to this country --

196
00:58:59,296 --> 00:59:06,795
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

197
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:11,796
I can't understand.

198
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:14,921
God has made different colors;

199
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:19,546
other we all would have looked same, like military,

200
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:22,796
and life would have been miserable.

201
00:59:23,171 --> 00:59:26,046
So the color has been created by nature.

202
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:31,921
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

203
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:35,795
I just don't understand.

204
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:42,046
Because such a myth is going on.

205
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:46,171
With this myth we are fighting.

206
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,921
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

207
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:52,921
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

208
00:59:54,421 --> 01:00:02,296
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

209
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:06,795
getting skin cancers.

210
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:09,421
I just don't understand.

211
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:12,796
There's no logic, there's no balance

212
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:16,795
in us to see that what we are doing.

213
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:22,796
Why are we wasting this precious time,

214
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:26,046
when we have to get transformation?

215
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:30,296
This anger can be with anything;

216
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,795
anything one can develop anger.

217
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:41,546
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

218
01:00:42,795 --> 01:00:46,171
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

219
01:00:46,795 --> 01:00:50,296
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

220
01:00:50,795 --> 01:00:52,795
they could be aggressive.

221
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:57,046
So they want to have this anger within them,

222
01:00:57,795 --> 01:01:01,921
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

223
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:06,046
This is the biggest problem:

224
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:10,795
why do we want to dominate others,

225
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:13,795
why do we want to oppress others,

226
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,546
and why do we want to take control of others?

227
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:19,921
We can't control ourselves;

228
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:23,546
why are we wanting to control others?

229
01:01:24,546 --> 01:01:25,921
What is the need?

230
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:32,296
Then, there are attachments:

231
01:01:33,421 --> 01:01:38,171
attachments to their houses,

232
01:01:38,546 --> 01:01:43,546
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

233
01:01:44,046 --> 01:01:50,296
But tomorrow you won't be here.

234
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,796
You'll go with open hands.

235
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,671
You can't carry anything with you.

236
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:05,171
So such attachment to things:

237
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:09,421
they're very particular about their cars,

238
01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:12,546
about their house, maintain it.

239
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:17,795
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

240
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:24,921
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

241
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:28,796
Why are you wasting your energy

242
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,046
in getting angry with others?

243
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:55,171
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

244
01:02:58,795 --> 01:03:07,796
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

245
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:13,296
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

246
01:03:13,796 --> 01:03:16,795
or women having for men.

247
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:21,546
To get attractive, for what?

248
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:25,171
Everybody has to get old.

249
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:32,171
What have you achieved by running after women,

250
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:36,795
running after other sex?

251
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:42,795
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

252
01:03:43,296 --> 01:03:46,171
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

253
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:48,795
you are regarded wonderful person.

254
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,795
This is not the way.

255
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:55,795
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

256
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:58,296
why are we doing this,

257
01:03:58,795 --> 01:04:01,795
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

258
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:11,671
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

259
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:14,296
some of them are full-mad.

260
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:17,796
And what they tell Me, that

261
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:20,671
they wanted to marry a particular woman

262
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:22,796
and a particular man or anything,

263
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:26,921
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

264
01:04:29,796 --> 01:04:31,796
That's not being very great.

265
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:38,296
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

266
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:43,421
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

267
01:04:43,795 --> 01:04:47,171
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

268
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:50,296
You can be very strong,

269
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:52,546
you can be very healthy

270
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:54,796
and you can be absolutely balanced,

271
01:04:55,296 --> 01:04:57,046
if you become the spirit.

272
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:02,546
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

273
01:05:05,795 --> 01:05:08,795
-- but have you reached that point?

274
01:05:10,046 --> 01:05:13,546
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

275
01:05:13,796 --> 01:05:18,546
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

276
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:24,796
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

277
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,796
Not yet. Not yet.

278
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:30,795
You have to know that;

279
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:33,671
because you are very great,

280
01:05:34,046 --> 01:05:36,796
you are very precious,

281
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:40,795
and you are so beautiful within.

282
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:44,171
But you are not aware of it.

283
01:05:45,296 --> 01:05:47,421
You have to become that.

284
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:51,796
That becoming is very important,

285
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:57,796
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

286
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:02,921
which is called as kundalini,

287
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:06,796
which can be awakened,

288
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:12,171
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

289
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:17,296
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

290
01:06:17,795 --> 01:06:21,921
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

291
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:23,796
And when it is free --

292
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:27,171
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

293
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:32,795
-- when it is absolutely free,

294
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:36,796
why don't you take your Self-realization,

295
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:40,421
and why don't you grow?

296
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:44,046
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

297
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:50,546
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

298
01:06:53,795 --> 01:06:56,046
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

299
01:06:56,546 --> 01:07:00,046
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

300
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:03,795
Are they speaking?

301
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:07,296
Hindus know about it,

302
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:10,796
that we have to get our Self-realization.

303
01:07:11,546 --> 01:07:15,795
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

304
01:07:19,921 --> 01:07:25,671
All this kind of rituals

305
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:29,796
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

306
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,421
what have we achieved? Nothing.

307
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:38,546
So now, it's important for us to know

308
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:44,795
that we have to have our evolution,

309
01:07:46,421 --> 01:07:49,795
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

310
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:54,795
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

311
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:59,046
If we were self-realized people

312
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:02,046
there would have been no problem.

313
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,795
All kinds of selfishness,

314
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:11,921
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

315
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,421
all kinds of conditioning and ego

316
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:21,795
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

317
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:25,296
we have to get over it.

318
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:28,546
And once you get over it, you get united.

319
01:08:28,796 --> 01:08:31,671
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

320
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:35,795
You lose all misidentifications.

321
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,171
Your misidentifications are that,

322
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:41,795
that "we belong to this country,

323
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:43,796
we belong to this religion, we belong to that."

324
01:08:44,296 --> 01:08:46,546
You belong to nothing.

325
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:51,296
You belong to the Kingdom of God.

326
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,796
That's what you have to achieve,

327
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:57,795
and you should be one there.

328
01:08:58,296 --> 01:09:02,046
But if you like story-telling, there's no end to it.

329
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,671
But you are wasting your time.

330
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:06,796
The time is running short.

331
01:09:07,546 --> 01:09:09,546
I've been now here for the last,

332
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:11,921
I don't know, twenty years or so.

333
01:09:12,546 --> 01:09:14,795
I worked very hard,

334
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:19,171
but what I find that people don't realize

335
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:21,546
what they are supposed to do.

336
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:30,796
They like people who will just say something very simple

337
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:34,546
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

338
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:41,546
So the whole humanity has to understand

339
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:48,796
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

340
01:09:49,546 --> 01:09:52,796
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

341
01:09:54,296 --> 01:09:59,046
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

342
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,795
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

343
01:10:03,296 --> 01:10:05,671
don't have to work out anything.

344
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:09,171
You take your Self-realization,

345
01:10:09,795 --> 01:10:15,171
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

346
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:23,546
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

347
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:27,795
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

348
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:32,795
It's against God's wish,

349
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:36,796
it's against humanity

350
01:10:37,296 --> 01:10:40,921
and it will destroy all the human beings.

351
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:47,296
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

352
01:10:47,795 --> 01:10:51,171
and you have to know that we are all one.

353
01:10:52,421 --> 01:10:56,795
We are all one, we are all global,

354
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:02,046
we are not separated by color,

355
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:06,795
race or religion, nation -- no.

356
01:11:08,171 --> 01:11:09,795
We are all one,

357
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:14,421
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

358
01:11:15,795 --> 01:11:17,296
or by shouting,

359
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:21,296
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

360
01:11:24,171 --> 01:11:26,796
It's not artificial.

361
01:11:27,296 --> 01:11:30,795
It has to be real, very real oneness,

362
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:33,795
and that comes to you once you realize

363
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:37,046
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

364
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:45,421
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

365
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:49,921
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

366
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:55,171
Why, why?

367
01:11:55,795 --> 01:11:58,921
Human beings have diverted themselves.

368
01:11:59,421 --> 01:12:04,296
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

369
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:14,046
Because of complete greed of oneself:

370
01:12:15,546 --> 01:12:21,421
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

371
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,171
or your relation.

372
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:28,713
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

373
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,795
You are the spirit.

374
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:37,795
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

375
01:12:39,046 --> 01:12:41,671
is the ocean of love,

376
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:45,671
is the ocean of all blessings.

377
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:49,796
So we have to decide.

378
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:53,046
Today I have to request you,

379
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:56,421
that there's not so much time left.

380
01:12:56,921 --> 01:13:01,796
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

381
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:05,171
That's all the religions have taught.

382
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:12,171
But how to do it was not so much explained,

383
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:15,671
and it didn't work out.

384
01:13:16,046 --> 01:13:19,921
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

385
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:22,546
Nobody listened to them.

386
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:26,046
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

387
01:13:27,546 --> 01:13:34,546
But now, please, all of you try to understand

388
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,296
the value of your life.

389
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:40,796
Why are you a human being?

390
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:43,046
Why are you created?

391
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:45,671
What is the purpose behind it?

392
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:50,546
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

393
01:13:51,921 --> 01:14:01,296
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

394
01:14:01,796 --> 01:14:06,546
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

395
01:14:07,796 --> 01:14:11,171
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

396
01:14:13,171 --> 01:14:17,296
The problem is, you'll get your realization

397
01:14:17,671 --> 01:14:21,546
in the sense the power within you will rise.

398
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:23,795
It's very well organized;

399
01:14:24,171 --> 01:14:27,296
actually, God is a great creator.

400
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:33,546
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

401
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:36,795
Every individual He has done it.

402
01:14:37,296 --> 01:14:42,296
With that happening, is not sufficient.

403
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:46,795
You enter into, say, a palace

404
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:50,796
and then you go round and see for yourself

405
01:14:51,296 --> 01:14:53,671
how beautiful you are,

406
01:14:54,171 --> 01:14:57,421
what beautiful things God has made for you.

407
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:01,421
Then grow into it.

408
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:04,546
Once you have grown into it,

409
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:10,421
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

410
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:19,795
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

411
01:15:21,046 --> 01:15:22,795
There have been some

412
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:26,421
-- they have become just statues.

413
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:32,296
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

414
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,421
how they were there.

415
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:44,795
So, tonight we can have the experience,

416
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,795
the experience of the spirit.

417
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:53,921
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

418
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:56,296
It never used to happen like that.

419
01:15:56,795 --> 01:16:00,296
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

420
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:06,671
Please, be ready for that,

421
01:16:07,046 --> 01:16:11,171
accept it, take it, and become.

422
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:13,796
Becoming is the point.

423
01:16:14,296 --> 01:16:16,796
What you become is the point.

424
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:23,546
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

425
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,671
is your problem, not Mine.

426
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:31,296
I can help you.

427
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,795
I can work it out.

428
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:41,171
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

429
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:45,795
It's much better,

430
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:49,796
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

431
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:54,671
So it's better such people leave,

432
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:58,171
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

433
01:17:01,796 --> 01:17:03,795
May God bless you all.

434
01:17:30,795 --> 01:17:33,421
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

435
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:39,795
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

436
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:47,171
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

437
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:52,671
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

438
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:56,795
But how many will grow?

439
01:17:57,296 --> 01:18:01,796
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

440
01:18:03,296 --> 01:18:07,421
then you have to practice it in the centers

441
01:18:07,921 --> 01:18:10,546
-- and it works out.

442
01:18:11,046 --> 01:18:14,921
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

443
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:19,171
and to this global problem.

444
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:23,171
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

445
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:27,795
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

446
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:31,671
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

447
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:35,046
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

448
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:41,171
But this dedication will make you so much

449
01:18:43,171 --> 01:18:44,921
one with yourself,

450
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:47,795
with the whole universe,

451
01:18:48,296 --> 01:18:51,921
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

452
01:18:52,421 --> 01:18:55,421
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

453
01:18:58,795 --> 01:19:01,795
So please don't stay here

454
01:19:02,046 --> 01:19:04,421
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

455
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:06,796
Nothing will happen to you.

456
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:12,671
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

457
01:19:26,046 --> 01:19:31,796
What you have to do is not to do anything;

458
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:36,171
to put just your hands towards Me.

459
01:19:38,171 --> 01:19:41,171
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

460
01:19:41,795 --> 01:19:44,671
because Mother Earth is very important.

461
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:48,796
Please put both the hands towards Me.

462
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,796
You don't have to pray,

463
01:20:05,296 --> 01:20:06,795
you don't have to say anything; just

464
01:20:07,296 --> 01:20:09,795
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

465
01:20:23,796 --> 01:20:26,795
Now please close your eyes.

466
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:32,546
It is important. Please close your eyes.

467
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:47,296
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

468
01:20:49,795 --> 01:20:53,795
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

469
01:20:54,296 --> 01:21:03,296
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

470
01:21:03,796 --> 01:21:07,296
and ultimately pierces through

471
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:14,296
the fontanel bone area

472
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:17,046
which was a soft bone in your head,

473
01:21:17,795 --> 01:21:20,046
on top of your head.

474
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,296
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

475
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:31,795
It pierces through that,

476
01:21:33,546 --> 01:21:36,421
and enters into the subtle energy

477
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:45,921
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

478
01:21:48,795 --> 01:21:51,546
They call it by different name.

479
01:21:52,046 --> 01:21:57,171
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

480
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:02,171
Some call it as "ruh."

481
01:22:02,795 --> 01:22:08,795
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

482
01:22:10,546 --> 01:22:12,796
Once you get connected with you,

483
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:18,171
when you start feeling on your fingers

484
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:22,296
some sort of a breeze.

485
01:22:22,795 --> 01:22:25,795
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

486
01:22:27,296 --> 01:22:29,421
but then it cools down

487
01:22:29,795 --> 01:22:33,546
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

488
01:22:36,171 --> 01:22:38,296
And it starts flowing.

489
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:43,796
You can now raise your left hand

490
01:22:44,296 --> 01:22:47,921
on top of your fontanel bone area.

491
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,795
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

492
01:22:52,046 --> 01:22:56,546
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

493
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:08,421
You can move your hand.

494
01:23:11,671 --> 01:23:13,921
Now see with your right hand

495
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:17,421
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

496
01:23:17,795 --> 01:23:20,921
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

497
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:24,296
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

498
01:23:24,795 --> 01:23:26,296
See for yourself.

499
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,921
Bend your head; better is to bend.

500
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,546
Please bend your head.

501
01:23:33,296 --> 01:23:36,546
Again put your right hand towards Me

502
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:43,796
and see for yourself with the left hand,

503
01:23:44,421 --> 01:23:50,296
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

504
01:23:50,795 --> 01:23:53,796
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

505
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:57,671
It is coming because of the heat within you.

506
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:19,171
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

507
01:24:19,795 --> 01:24:22,296
in their hands or on their fingers,

508
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:25,421
or out of the fontanel bone area

509
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:27,795
-- this is the real baptism --

510
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:30,795
please raise both your hands.

511
01:24:39,795 --> 01:24:41,171
Just imagine:

512
01:24:41,795 --> 01:24:45,671
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

513
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:48,795
from its destruction.

514
01:24:49,296 --> 01:24:51,421
Try to understand your importance.

515
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,421
You can put down your hand.

516
01:24:55,796 --> 01:24:59,795
Everyone practically has felt it.

517
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:02,296
That means you are already matured

518
01:25:02,795 --> 01:25:04,671
to get your spiritual life.

519
01:25:04,921 --> 01:25:07,671
You are just on the brink of it.

520
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:10,296
That's how you got it.

521
01:25:10,795 --> 01:25:15,796
It's last jump to reality.

522
01:25:16,296 --> 01:25:20,795
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

523
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:23,796
what is your spirit

524
01:25:24,796 --> 01:25:28,671
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

525
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:31,046
what are spiritual powers.

526
01:25:31,546 --> 01:25:33,296
For this I would request you

527
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,171
to first to come to the follow-up program,

528
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:41,421
and after that you can join any one of the centers

529
01:25:41,795 --> 01:25:44,921
which are closer to you and work it out.

530
01:25:45,546 --> 01:25:47,796
We have to work for the whole world.

531
01:25:49,296 --> 01:25:51,796
You should know there are eighty-five countries

532
01:25:52,296 --> 01:25:54,795
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

533
01:25:55,296 --> 01:26:00,546
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

534
01:26:00,796 --> 01:26:03,795
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

535
01:26:04,171 --> 01:26:06,921
Only three years back I started there.

536
01:26:07,421 --> 01:26:11,795
And in England it's more than sixteen years

537
01:26:12,296 --> 01:26:16,796
I've been working here, and after that also:

538
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:19,921
all the time, every year.

539
01:26:20,546 --> 01:26:22,046
But somehow

540
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:32,421
their growth is very much there,

541
01:26:33,795 --> 01:26:41,546
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

542
01:26:45,796 --> 01:26:51,546
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

543
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:54,795
very much enjoy the reality.

544
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:58,921
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

545
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:02,421
May God bless you.

546
01:27:07,046 --> 01:27:08,796
They want to sing one song

547
01:27:09,546 --> 01:27:13,046
which was written in the twelfth century

548
01:27:13,546 --> 01:27:16,795
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

549
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:19,671
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

550
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:24,796
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

551
01:27:25,421 --> 01:27:27,921
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

552
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:29,921
-- give me the union.

553
01:27:31,296 --> 01:27:35,796
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

554
01:27:36,421 --> 01:27:37,795
You don't have to do it.

555
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:40,795
Now you'll give up automatically.

556
01:27:42,296 --> 01:27:45,171
The light that you'll have, itself,

557
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:49,296
automatically you will give up, automatically.

558
01:27:49,795 --> 01:27:51,546
You don't have to do anything.

559
01:27:51,796 --> 01:27:54,546
But you have to meditate.

560
01:27:54,879 --> 01:27:58,795
About ten minutes, it's not much.
