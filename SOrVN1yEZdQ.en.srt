1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,565
Nice to be back again in Hampstead.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,565
I always enjoyed Hampstead

3
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:15,605
because,as I have told, you in London,

4
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:19,905
many people who were

5
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,725
great spiritual lived in this area.

6
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,885
They preferred it to other places.

7
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:39,945
So I believe that many people who live in this area

8
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:44,145
must be also spiritual,

9
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:53,305
must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-Realisation.

10
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:58,825
It’s a very important time: when you are born.

11
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,485
It’s the most important in the history of the universe.

12
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:10,345
You are created a human being to become your Spirit.

13
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,785
There’s nothing in between.

14
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,645
If you have intelligence, pure intelligence,

15
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,785
you can see through all that.

16
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,525
You have to test your intelligence on this.

17
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,305
Whatever we think and whatever we conceive

18
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:33,765
and whatever we try to organise ourselves into,

19
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:36,525
mostly comes from our conditionings,

20
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:40,905
not from the Spirit, because we have not touched the Spirit.

21
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:48,705
But innately we have got a sense to know

22
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,105
that these are very important times;

23
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,265
that there must be something great in the atmosphere,

24
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:58,085
that there are so many people who are seeking.

25
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:04,145
It’s something remarkable. If this misses your attention,

26
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:06,145
that means you are not alert.

27
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:10,705
There are people of all types, all kinds. But seekers

28
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,145
of this calibre have been very few.

29
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:21,305
Now England has its own problems,

30
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:23,565
and London has its own peculiarities.

31
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:31,205
Despite the fact I have been in London for about

32
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,945
eight and a half years,

33
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:38,205
I feel that

34
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:43,245
the reception of the truth has been very, very poor.

35
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,345
Maybe, I am luckier than others.

36
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:58,325
It’s the conditioning, again I would say, of another type

37
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:03,105
that prevails [in] the minds.

38
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:09,005
First we had, about twenty-five years back

39
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:11,645
the conditioning of the science,

40
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,145
but scientists themselves have refuted it.

41
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,225
They themselves have challenged the science

42
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:21,205
and they themselves know that it’s not such a happy affair,

43
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,125
just to be a scientist.

44
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,425
Then comes the intellectuals.

45
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,865
The books started pouring in, in the market:

46
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:31,565
all kinds of books.You can read about everything.

47
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:33,565
Everyone knows about everything!

48
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,985
And once you start reading about them,

49
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,105
you conceive something;

50
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,045
your conceptions are built about the truth also.

51
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,485
The thing you have never seen,

52
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,285
the thing you have never felt, you cannot conceive it,

53
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,365
it is to be seen.

54
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,685
Like I had never seen Hampstead before,

55
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,545
and the first idea of my husband was to buy a house in Hampstead

56
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,045
it’s surprising! I was very happy at that point.

57
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,205
So I said, “Let’s go and see!”

58
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,505
Without seeing it, if I had some conception about it,

59
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,265
it would have been wrong.

60
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,225
My seeing is different from others, I must say.

61
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,605
I liked the place immensely,

62
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:24,565
but he,from the point of view [of] distances and all of that he said,

63
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:28,285
“It’s not good.” And naturally his ideas prevailed;doesn’t matter.

64
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:35,005
But seeing, itself, makes you understand.

65
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:41,385
But what is Self-Realisation? It’s not only seeing.

66
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,945
When you come to Hampstead you don’t see it.

67
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,385
You feel it.

68
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:55,465
You feel it. Now many people say you can feel it, but the idea of feeling is also quite conditioned.

69
00:04:57,545 --> 00:05:01,785
Like, some children like to cuddle a little doll.

70
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,545
They feel the doll. But God knows how far they feel it.

71
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,725
They might be feeling it physically,

72
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:14,525
or emotionally also they might be feeling some sort of a security with the doll, maybe.

73
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:18,265
Psychologically they might be deriving some joy out of that

74
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,225
doll itself.

75
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,865
Or maybe the image,

76
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,105
which has some sort of an attraction

77
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:31,265
of some sort of a thing that is built within their unconscious,

78
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,265
that they feel so close to that.

79
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,605
But a person who is a realised-soul

80
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:43,285
does not feel a doll that way, even if it’s a child.

81
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,805
It’s surprising. You must watch a realised child

82
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:53,605
getting to a doll. It’s very surprising.

83
00:05:54,545 --> 00:06:00,185
For example, I bought two dolls from London for my grandchildren and they rejected completely.

84
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:03,205
They said, “What sort of dolls these are?” I said, “Why?”

85
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,505
“They are unhappy!” I said, “They are not unhappy.”

86
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,545
“No, see their lips!”

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,705
You see, the lips of the dolls here is all just like a duck’s beak.

88
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,605
They said, “They have resentment. They are angry.

89
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,865
They are not realised!”

90
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,765
That’s it!

91
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:31,445
If you are a happy person then the whole get-up of your face changes,

92
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,645
and they could see, they could feel it.

93
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,645
They rejected: “We don’t want these dolls.”

94
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:43,285
And then next time when I had to go I had to go

95
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:46,165
round the whole places. First of all they were plastics;

96
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,165
so plastics they don’t like.

97
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:52,565
They don’t like plastic. Somehow realised people don’t like plastics,automatically.

98
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:56,645
They wouldn’t wear plastic clothes,  they wouldn’t wear nylon clothes,

99
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,645
they wouldn’t wear mixed clothes: very difficult.

100
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:02,685
They must have cotton clothes. Even if they have one, they’ll wear that the whole day,

101
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:05,165
morning, evening, every time, the same thing.

102
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,245
You see, it’s a different sensitivity which we do not have before Realisation.

103
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,765
They have a different sensitivity.

104
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:19,085
And the coefficients of a doll which emits vibrations they like.

105
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,905
But it’s very difficult to get such dolls nowadays; impossible.

106
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:28,685
Because where are these artists who are realised-souls who used to make dolls?

107
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,165
I have seen they make their own dolls,

108
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:37,665
out of something:. sometimes my saris they will use or something.

109
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,145
And sleep with those.

110
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:46,145
It’s something to be understood that, after Realisation,

111
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:52,485
the thing you feel is not what you feel through your heart or through your conditioning of ages, also, maybe.

112
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,485
Like if you have been living with a woman

113
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,165
for many years with blue eyes,

114
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,485
then you may like a doll with blue eyes. You may,

115
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,065
because you have that image into your head.

116
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,285
You may like. Or you may have a nanny of with blue eyes

117
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,025
you may like a doll like that.

118
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,845
It’s all psychological.  It’s conditioning very deep in you.

119
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:16,425
But Spirit has no conditioning. It’s a free thing.

120
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:23,325
What does it feel? It feels the joy of Creation,

121
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,125
which we cannot.

122
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:29,265
Before Realisation we cannot feel.

123
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,845
You see, when we see something, where is the joy?

124
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,425
Now, for example, if a fussy man comes here he’ll say,

125
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,845
“Oh, God, what a thing! I have to take out my shoes

126
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:42,045
and sit like that! And the chairs were horrible!

127
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,825
And couldn’t sit: very uncomfortable!

128
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,825
And the colour was all white.”

129
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,065
He couldn’t bear it.

130
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,305
And I don’t know: all sorts of things.

131
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,665
The thoughts will start.

132
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:58,385
If you buy something – same thing.

133
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,145
If you see something – same thing.

134
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,105
There’s no joy!

135
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:05,245
We just start thinking!

136
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:10,825
Or if not, to avoid that, you may start a poetry about it.

137
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:15,625
It’s sometimes so artificial, some of the poetry.

138
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:20,665
So artificially put there that you can see it clearly

139
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:25,705
clearly that this man is just a sadist, wants to make you cry.

140
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:26,985
Like Lord Byron!

141
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:31,965
You can see it so clearly that this man has no sincerity of purpose.

142
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,825
He’s not sincere.

143
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,365
That sincerity you cannot feel

144
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,465
unless and until you are realised

145
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,565
because such a poem you won’t like at all,

146
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,505
whether you understand the language or not.

147
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,645
The whole tone of it will emit horrible vibrations;

148
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:50,725
it’s absolutely the essence of everything is nothing but vibrations.

149
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:58,425
Everything is nothing but vibrations; the rest is all zero.

150
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,705
We are nothing but our vibrations

151
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,185
which are

152
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,865
emitted because we are now connected with the Spirit.

153
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,005
But otherwise also, whether you are connected with Spirit

154
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,865
or not, you emit vibrations.

155
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:19,345
But these are the vibrations without the light in it,

156
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:22,885
and you can feel the vibrations of a person out and out.

157
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,505
You can feel, feel how.

158
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,405
You can feel on your centres.

159
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:34,945
All your centres become active and you start feeling on your centres.

160
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:39,045
That means all these five centres, six, seven centres you start feeling.

161
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,305
Even you may not feel in your fingers.

162
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:47,845
Some of us Sahaja yogis may not feel also even today after so many days because their Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad.

163
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,105
They must have smoked in,  I think, ten lives,

164
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:57,825
and must have been horrible Vishuddhi Chakra,

165
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:03,505
and maybe that’s why it’s all on the myelin sheath of the nerves that you cannot feel it.

166
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,705
That’s a different point.

167
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,605
But you will feel it on your centres.

168
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:11,045
And the feeling on the centre is emitted in your nervous system.

169
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:16,325
And when it comes to it you feel it on your centres

170
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:19,465
and you know, you just know.

171
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:27,225
And you know it as vibratory awareness.

172
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:30,965
This vibratory awareness has to grow, no doubt.

173
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,185
The sensitivity has to grow, no doubt.

174
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,485
But, first you must touch it.

175
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,665
If it has not even touched, then how can it grow?

176
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:48,065
But we are so conditioned that we take to things

177
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,025
which superficially are very appealing.

178
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,585
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

179
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,485
It’s truth. It’s reality.

180
00:11:57,565 --> 00:12:00,245
Of course, you cannot pay for reality. I mean, how can you pay?

181
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:02,245
If it is reality, you cannot pay for it.

182
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,125
That’s one simple thing.

183
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,725
You cannot artificially say you are realised-soul.  You cannot.

184
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,825
There was a girl, I met her in Portugal,

185
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,545
mischievous one, and she wanted to stick on with the Sahaja yogis

186
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:17,905
because she was very negative and she wanted to disturb the Sahaja yogis.

187
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:20,485
And she came to the programme

188
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,885
and she told me, “Oh, I am feeling very well, Mother. I am feeling vibrations!”

189
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,425
I just looked at her.

190
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:26,985
I kept quiet: because I knew she was not.

191
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,445
I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to create trouble.

192
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:32,325
But second day when she turned up I said, “Why are you telling me lies?”

193
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,565
“No, no, no!” I said, “Yes,

194
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:40,145
you are telling me lies. You have to be sincere.

195
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,265
What are you going to gain?”

196
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:45,525
Say, you are mischievous.You are playing into the hands of negative forces:

197
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:47,165
what is your gain?

198
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,545
You are the Spirit. The Spirit is within you.

199
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,325
You have to become the Spirit.

200
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:57,085
It’s your own joy, is your own property, is your own Self:

201
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,145
which is not known to you.

202
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,545
Why not be honest about it

203
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,645
and get to it instead of playing tricks

204
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,165
with yourself?

205
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,625
And then playing tricks with other Sahaja yogis:

206
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,625
what is the use? What is the gain?

207
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,125
Why are you playing into the hands of the satanic force?

208
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:15,425
Why don’t you play into the hands of the Divine force?”

209
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,845
She said, “No, no, Mother, I am feeling it!”

210
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,245
I said, “See, don’t tell me lies.

211
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,445
I know for definite you are not feeling it,

212
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,825
and if you are not going to be honest you are not going to come to my programme at all.

213
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,325
You have to be honest yourself.

214
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:30,265
If you are not honest I am not going to have you here.”

215
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:35,105
But dishonesty sometimes reaches a very absurd limit,

216
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:40,385
because honesty is only up to which point you can see.

217
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,065
Say, you can see the colour

218
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:46,705
is white – up to that you are honest.

219
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:49,345
But if you start saying, “I know who has painted it,

220
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,445
and I know who has done the job and I know who is the company,”

221
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,065
and all that, that’s not true.

222
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,305
So honesty is up to the point you know.

223
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:01,065
Beyond that, if you start saying things because you have read somewhere something

224
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,665
or you have heard something,

225
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:04,665
that’s wrong, that’s not being honest.

226
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:08,385
So we have to have honesty and open-mindedness.

227
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,705
You have to be open-minded and honest,

228
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,365
so that you see for yourself.

229
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:19,385
Because as I told you it’s not like other places where you can just go and become members– nothing.

230
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,025
First you have get your Realisation.

231
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,425
Secondly, you have to grow into it.

232
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:29,045
Those who cannot do, will be left out.

233
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,705
You can’t help it.

234
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,625
How far can you move it people?

235
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,825
How far can you tell them?

236
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,325
There’s no binding force.

237
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:41,085
You are completely free to leave it or to take it.

238
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,125
If you want to take it,

239
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,185
well and good. If you don’t want to take it,

240
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:49,125
no one is going to force you at all in this,! Because you cannot force.

241
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,725
You can force a horse to eat,

242
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,065
that is possible;

243
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:57,345
but you cannot force any human being to be a realised-soul.

244
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,345
You cannot.

245
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,205
Not only that he has to ask for it

246
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:04,025
but he has to,later on, work for it.

247
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,485
It is a tremendous thing you are asking for

248
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,185
and it’s the greatest thing that you are achieving.

249
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,085
It is made easy, I should say.

250
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,365
The times are such. It looks easy but it’s not so easy.

251
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:23,585
In Sahaja Yoga there are more drop-outs than sticking people.

252
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:27,865
Naturally, because you have to be honest.

253
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,825
You have to be very honest with it

254
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,985
and you have to give a try.

255
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:39,305
Like in Spain I met about five, six ladies

256
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,205
and two men who came to see me.

257
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,285
When I came out I was very reluctant

258
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,205
to have anything to do with them.

259
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:49,565
But, all the Sahaja yogis were so impressed.

260
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:50,625
I don’t know why.

261
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:54,345
“Oh, Mother they are so good. You don’t know,

262
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:58,245
they came and looked at your photograph and they did this and all that.”

263
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:01,225
I said, “Now, it’s all right if you want I will try!

264
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:04,485
But somehow I don’t think much is going to work out.”

265
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:08,585
And they thought they had found such a great bunch of people,

266
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:11,145
who are real Sahaja yogis of the thing.

267
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,345
I said, “Did you see their vibrations?”

268
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,285
They said, “No, Mother we were waiting for you.”

269
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:19,305
I said, “All right, doesn’t matter. I’ll have a look at them.”

270
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:24,805
And they said,

271
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:28,545
first question they asked,“Mother, why is it Sahaja yogis don’t smoke?”

272
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,665
I said, “Because they don’t want to.”

273
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,345
I mean, is that a question to ask?

274
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,765
I mean, if you smoke is it very normal?

275
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,745
I just couldn’t understand this question.

276
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:43,145
She said, “No, we don’t want to lose our freedom

277
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,725
of smoking and freedom of drinking.”

278
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:48,845
I said, “Do you think you are free?

279
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:50,385
You are a slave.

280
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,605
You can’t give up even if you want to.

281
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:58,065
I can free you from that or your Kundalini can free you but you cannot.

282
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,025
Even if you want you cannot give up,

283
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:01,565
but here they just give up.

284
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:03,725
I don’t tell them, I never force them,

285
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:08,845
but it just happens because if you get the nectar of life you don’t care for other nonsensical things.

286
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,325
It’s simple as that.”

287
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:14,005
But they were so frightened with the Sahaja yogis’ style of life,

288
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:18,005
means they don’t smoke and drink every night, they said, “This is impossible”.

289
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:18,805
They gave up.

290
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,725
Can you imagine? At the first talk we had!

291
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:26,325
But then we had people with such tremendous characters.

292
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,965
They came for the program.

293
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:32,165
I was so very happy, extremely happy and joyous.

294
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,025
Everybody said, “Mother, why?”

295
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,425
They were little, sometimes,

296
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,985
not so much receptive, maybe, according to Sahaja yogis.

297
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:44,105
But I could feel my vibrations sucked into them,

298
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:48,505
absolutely flowing: the energy just getting into them,

299
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,485
and suddenly they said, “Ah! Got it.”

300
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,265
And tremendous people!

301
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:59,305
Very well-educated also, some of them.

302
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:05,185
But extremely well-versed about what we have to achieve.

303
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,425
I was surprised

304
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:10,905
in Spain there are people who know Sanskrit so well and about everything,

305
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,425
about Chaitanya and all that.

306
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,545
They know so well.

307
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:18,225
It’s most surprising, and I used to think only scholarships exist in England.

308
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,665
No. I was surprised.

309
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,245
All of them knew about chakras.

310
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:29,105
They knew about what it means. Everything they have sorted it out.

311
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,085
I said,“When did you start?”

312
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,045
They said, “About, when we were, I think, ten years of age.”

313
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,505
I said, “Ten years of age? How?”

314
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:40,025
They said, “We, we just couldn’t be satisfied with what was the answer here.”

315
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,705
“Such grown-up people,” I said.

316
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:45,305
From ten years of age. So many of them!

317
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:47,305
And you should have seen the way they were!

318
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:53,305
And they recognise Sahaja Yoga and the tremendous effect it has and the work that it is doing.

319
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:58,385
You will be amazed the way these people behaved towards Sahaj Yoga.

320
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:04,165
Then I said, “Next time, I am not staying in London – Spain.”

321
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:07,725
Yeah, really, I tell you!

322
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:12,685
Just the kind of reception. There’s no barrier at all in their minds.

323
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,705
It’s such pure intelligence, sharp, to see this is the thing

324
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,205
– where are we running.

325
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:22,205
And really I felt that, eight years I have wasted in this country, that time.

326
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:25,665
Really for a moment I just felt, “Oh, God!”

327
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,505
But you know the importance of this country is so great

328
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,505
because it’s the heart of the universe.

329
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:34,225
I have to labour through it! And such lethargy and such inertia

330
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:38,165
and explanations.  Intellectuals have a very good,

331
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:43,325
an easy-chair way of looking at things, very easy-chair way of looking at things.

332
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:47,105
Easy-chair politicians they are.

333
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,965
“Well, it’s very interesting.”

334
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:54,265
Many a times I have heard [this], “It’s very interesting, you know, Mother, what you have given us.

335
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,465
Very nice, yes, yes.”

336
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:03,565
It’s very common! But there, for them, it was a heavenly gift because they knew what it was.

337
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,165
What’s the use of all the scholarship of Lord Byron

338
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,665
when you can’t recognise Christ?

339
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,005
When you can’t recognise the truth?

340
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,945
What’s this education for?

341
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:21,845
I was amazed at these people. They never went to Cambridge and they were not Oxbridges.

342
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,365
Most surprising!

343
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:31,125
And they were people of great intelligence, very well-versed.

344
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,425
And in Spain!

345
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,685
Can you imagine?

346
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,805
The same I will say of Italy.

347
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:40,885
Italians are supposed to be very dishonest and this,  that, I have heard.

348
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,965
Nobody was dishonest with me

349
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:49,185
as far as I am concerned: very upright, straightforward and tremendous people.

350
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,905
Just my photograph convinced them.

351
00:20:56,725 --> 00:21:00,305
They said, “The face shows!” They hate the Pope.

352
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,845
They hate the Papal things. They know all about Pope. Everything they know.

353
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:09,185
They have sorted out everything. But to know so much about chakras and things,

354
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,565
I was amazed.

355
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:14,105
They knew about tantrism. They knew that Hitler used tantrikas.

356
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:18,525
They knew that Hitler used all these things. Actually, they told me. So I was amazed how did they know?

357
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:24,525
I dared not say this before because everyone who is following all these tantrikas would have been angry with me.

358
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,545
But that’s what Hitler did.

359
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,085
And so much they knew!

360
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:34,525
One of the boys was just, you can call him a hippie or whatever he may be.

361
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:38,265
He went on the street shouting, “Oh, Mother has come now!

362
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:40,625
The Mother has come! The Holy Mother has come! What are you doing now?

363
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,965
Come along to the programme!” He was shouting on the street like “Eureka!”

364
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:48,465
And a learned man, in the real sense of the word.

365
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:52,725
It’s such a pleasure to talk to them, such a pleasure, I tell you.

366
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:56,245
I think it is time that English should come down a little,

367
00:21:58,305 --> 00:21:58,805
really.

368
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,445
Australia again: just look at Australians,

369
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,145
they are supposed to be convicts.

370
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,605
Supposed to be; I can’t understand.

371
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:14,565
You see, this high-handedness, or we can call it

372
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,545
condescendingly to watch something

373
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:20,565
is not proper, it’s not proper.

374
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:25,305
You must come down in humility, otherwise things will not work out,

375
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:27,305
I can tell you. You have to humble down.

376
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,685
We have Hampstead: so what?

377
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,325
What have you done to Blake?

378
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,125
Can you understand him?

379
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:43,585
Do you know who he was?

380
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,665
Do you know what he wanted to say?

381
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:47,885
What he wanted to communicate?

382
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:51,965
Even in his programme, where I went,

383
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:58,385
to see his beautiful paintings, people were watching how many nude women and nude men he has produced.

384
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:06,285
With all this, and this [low] level, I just couldn’t understand it.

385
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:09,005
You must understand holiness.

386
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:12,945
You must understand auspiciousness. You must understand sublime things.

387
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,565
Something great that is beyond

388
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:21,165
just now, but is within your reach because you are sublime.

389
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:23,545
You are not a low-level animal.

390
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:24,825
You are sublime.

391
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,365
You are the Spirit.

392
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:32,005
Unless and until you really assume that situation

393
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,905
with that pride and glory,

394
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:37,745
to God you are nothing.

395
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,925
You are just zero, useless.

396
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:45,625
And this is what I’ll find always, new people coming,

397
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:49,245
even in your Hampstead, Magda, and they just disappear.

398
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:53,045
It’s like one lecture, it’s free. “All right, let’s go and see Mother.”That’s all.

399
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:59,725
All these experiences, even in a country like Portugal,

400
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:02,085
Portugal.

401
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:07,225
The way people have done, Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

402
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,525
I go there for three days only.

403
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:15,145
Only for three days in a year. I must have gone there only twice so far.

404
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:17,965
Look at them:

405
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:23,785
young people taking up responsibility, working it out for their country.

406
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:27,785
So much they understand of auspiciousness.

407
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,465
How have we lost all that sense of holiness and auspiciousness?

408
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,245
We are running after people who are collecting money from you,

409
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:35,785
giving you a circus.

410
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:37,905
How can you?

411
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:44,545
How can you not find out that this is not the truth, that you have to be the truth,

412
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:45,905
that you are something great?

413
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,465
Why can’t we assume that situation?

414
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:50,645
We are not our ego.

415
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,225
No, we are not.

416
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:55,125
We are the Spirit,the sublime, the great.

417
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,105
And that’s what I find.

418
00:24:57,385 --> 00:25:01,885
Many new people coming, then they disappear, then they come after ten days,

419
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,885
then after they come after one month.

420
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:06,385
They have this problem, that problem.

421
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,165
Then why not grow?

422
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,085
When are we going to grow?

423
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:18,425
When are we going to become fully that?

424
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:20,645
Time is very short, my children.

425
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:23,765
Time is very, very short. Believe me.

426
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,685
Some people advise me, “Mother, you have to be very strict and all that.”

427
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:30,325
I don’t know how a Mother could be strict.

428
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:34,965
What should I do? Because, you cannot force it on anyone.

429
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:39,325
The problem [I have / I’m helpless], is I cannot force it on to you

430
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:44,865
This is a big problem. You must understand this. You are seekers.

431
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:51,465
You are seekers of very great times, born in this great country of yours, but so much conditioned.

432
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:56,745
This is for you to take it within yourself, what you are, and to achieve that.

433
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:01,465
This is something cannot be forced.

434
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:09,325
I cannot mischievously do something or cleverly do something or cunningly say something to convince you.

435
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:12,985
It is not that. It is something that has to happen within you,

436
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:16,425
that you have to be something more than what you are.

437
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,705
It’s that concern of Mine

438
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:23,705
because it’s my job

439
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:29,025
that keeps me here.

440
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:35,305
You must know your real Self which is seeking,

441
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,225
which is seeking the truth.

442
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:41,505
It will never be satisfied with all these monkey tricks that people are indulging into.

443
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:44,845
It’s no monkey tricks.

444
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:47,065
You don’t become a monkey,

445
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:49,805
like dancing, jumping, singing.

446
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,265
This is not the thing.

447
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:55,165
In your awareness, in your central nervous system

448
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:58,605
you should feel the presence of your Spirit.

449
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,045
That’s it.

450
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:04,405
If you have discarded Christianity ?

451
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:06,745
like, some people write to me,

452
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:09,725
“Mother, I have many problems. First begins with Christianity” ?

453
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,025
where do you land?

454
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:16,765
Even if you discard Christianity you can’t do without Christ.

455
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:20,025
Christ is there. I mean, Christ is our soul. We cannot do without Him.

456
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:27,005
Then you come into another thing,

457
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:30,345
then you fall into another trap, then fall into another trap.

458
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:36,145
You miss the essence of it every time you fall into these peripheries.

459
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:41,725
The essence is in the centre of it and that centre is within you; is your Spirit.

460
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:48,745
You may ask me a hundred questions, I will give you two hundred answers;

461
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,925
makes no difference at all, I tell you.

462
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:52,765
It is of no value,

463
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,405
of no availability

464
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,005
to you or any goodness out of it you, believe me.

465
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,925
You have to be what you are.

466
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:05,605
Unless and until that happens and you establish it within yourself,

467
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:09,325
it’s such a waste of life, waste of this Creation,

468
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,385
everything I feel wasted.

469
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,085
So I have to request you again and again.

470
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:19,285
Of course, in London now there are some very great Sahaja yogis, no doubt,

471
00:28:20,185 --> 00:28:20,885
we have,

472
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:26,345
but the way it has been progressing if I were in any other country, I tell you,

473
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:28,525
things would have been very different.

474
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:32,345
I can assure you this one, any other country.

475
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,165
America? I’ve been there only once.

476
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:36,225
Can you believe it?

477
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,345
Long time back, that too for about

478
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,905
four, five days, and this time when I went

479
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,525
I was hardly in any place for more than three days.

480
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:47,725
Say, Houston, hardly for three days and how many people there are.

481
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:50,365
I mean, you don’t know. Ask Gavin, he’ll tell you.

482
00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:57,725
What’s wrong with us? Let’s see.

483
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:00,065
I just can’t understand

484
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:02,285
why we can’t grow.

485
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:09,365
Why can’t we give up our conditionings easily and take to truth and get into it?

486
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:16,985
We don’t understand is it the importance of this time,

487
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:22,925
the vital nature of this happening.

488
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:29,205
Or have we lost that sense of seriousness

489
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:35,425
where an emergency of this kind has arisen today which we don’t feel or fathom?

490
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:40,745
Or we just think that it’s just a joke going on?

491
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:45,285
Or our life we treat is just like

492
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,485
a joke or a frivolous thing?

493
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:48,565
What is it?

494
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:52,845
I still can’t understand what stops that truth…

495
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,225
beyond me.

496
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,865
The land is fertile, beautiful.

497
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:07,105
I am not sown my seeds in a wrong land;

498
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:08,645
I know that.

499
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,965
But doesn’t grow; it doesn’t grow.

500
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:13,285
It doesn’t take shape.

501
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:16,785
What’s the matter?

502
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:21,945
Today there are new people, I am happy to know,

503
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:24,345
and I have to make a humble request to all of you.

504
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,465
If you have to come to Sahaja Yoga

505
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:33,245
you have to be people who have to understand that reality is not a joke.

506
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,745
It’s not a frivolous thing.

507
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:37,625
You have to become

508
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:39,865
a realised-soul

509
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:46,485
and you have to grow in the light of that Realisation and you have to master this art.

510
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,625
We need now masters all over.

511
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:53,945
Not that somebody else is your master but you become your own master.

512
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:59,265
Such people are needed to channelise the energy of God.

513
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:02,885
I am sure

514
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:07,005
Warren must have told you all about it.

515
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,525
He’s another great character I have;

516
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,965
very proud of him,

517
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:17,325
the way he feels responsible for the whole world,

518
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:20,605
the way he came down.

519
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,345
He sacrificed so much, so much.

520
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:26,125
I mean we, I don’t need any money from an, anything as such,

521
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:31,005
but even money-wise I am sure he must have done something.

522
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,725
I don’t know because I have never taken any money from him as such.

523
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:35,965
But even there I am sure,

524
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:41,965
he established an ashram, he established people, he got them, he worked it out.

525
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:46,285
I mean it’s remarkable, and how people followed him, seeing him the way he is.

526
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:52,705
He doesn’t have any private life left except for to enjoy this privacy of the Spirit with others,

527
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:58,045
and if you see his background

528
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:02,145
he’ll tell you that he knew he was a seeker

529
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:06,625
but in the seeking he committed so many mistakes, so many mistakes.

530
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:09,585
But look at his sensitivity.

531
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,325
He knows where the Kundalini is,

532
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:16,445
he knows how to correct it and not him but most of the people from Australia know it so well.

533
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:22,745
It’s nothing mundane.

534
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,685
It will be very sad

535
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:30,405
and unhappy if you people get your Realisation

536
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,245
and lose it and do not develop into it.

537
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:36,565
I don’t know what would be the category of such people

538
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:41,785
whom God has given the light and they didn’t give light to anyone.

539
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:45,545
I don’t know what should be the position.

540
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:49,165
Today I am rather concerned,

541
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:54,085
very much concerned because I have come back from these three countries.

542
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:57,965
I was amazed.

543
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:01,465
France: tremendous.

544
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:04,865
French people,

545
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:08,565
I used to always say that these “les miserables” and all that.

546
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,325
Nothing of the kind.

547
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:15,165
There’s a priest who got his Realisation.

548
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:20,845
He formed an association called “Saving the people from gurus.”

549
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,485
Very clever,

550
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,765
and he is a priest still,

551
00:33:27,825 --> 00:33:30,505
but he is a Sahaja yogi out and out.

552
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:35,965
And what he does,  those people who go to him and tell against the Christianity

553
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:37,965
he said,“Why don’t you go to Sahaja Yoga?”

554
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:42,045
Anybody whom he saves, he sends them to Sahaja Yoga…

555
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:43,545
all that.

556
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,905
But the other day he said, “Mother, why should we have Pope anymore?”

557
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:49,845
Look at that.

558
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:52,625
And he stays in the church and works for Sahaja Yoga.

559
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,105
Can you beat that?

560
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:59,445
Because he thinks he has to save people who are misled.

561
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:00,725
He does that.

562
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,725
We have people of that calibre.

563
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:08,045
Another one we met,

564
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,425
another one very great one,

565
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,085
in Portugal.

566
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:18,045
He told me that the T.M. gentleman wanted to establish his kingdom in Portugal.

567
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:20,345
He’s got a very big land and all that.

568
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,205
And he told me all the secrets.

569
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:25,745
He said, “I am going to talk to the people who are in charge here.

570
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:26,685
They are sensible.”

571
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,625
I said, “Really? Are you sure?”

572
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:33,285
I said, “If you want to talk to anybody here in Mentmore, they’ll not listen.. They are very satisfied

573
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,385
with the yards of black suits they are wearing

574
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:43,205
and with the so-called idea of sitting on a gold gilded chair.

575
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:48,865
All that stupidity.” He said, “No, not in Portugal. They are very sensible people.

576
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:51,105
They realise it. I am going to talk to them.”

577
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:55,045
Because they are all suffering

578
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,665
so early. Only three years they have been doing it.

579
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:01,905
They are all suffering on the left side, their ears are finished, somebody’s eyes are finished,

580
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:06,465
somebody’s problem is on the left side, somebody has a problem on the left Void and all that.

581
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:08,525
I cured, of course.

582
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:11,805
But they said, “All of us are suffering.”

583
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:14,605
That means they are very sensitive also to suffer so fast.

584
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:20,745
And they are realising, they are reaching all of them, even their administrators and their;

585
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:24,785
everybody’s realising that there’s some sort of a nonsense going on in this T.M.

586
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,585
Just imagine.

587
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,385
When I went back,

588
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,345
so transformed and changed.

589
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:39,485
The one gentleman had an eye like this.

590
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:43,045
It’s all opened out equally the same, everything,face so transformed.

591
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:46,185
I said, “I can’t recognise you, the way you are changed.”

592
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,625
Such a short time, in eight days,

593
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:51,225
they worked it out.

594
00:35:56,025 --> 00:36:00,985
Portugal is a country known for its escape nowadays.

595
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:05,065
There are nobody, we should call,the real Portuguese

596
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,365
have run away from that country.

597
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:07,945
They are settled in Brazil.

598
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:14,125
Spain, people have not much hopes from Spain, politically.It’s a hopeless country, they say.

599
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:17,285
Italy is the worst of all. They have Mafia, this.

600
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:19,565
And in that Maya

601
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:24,985
these beautiful lotuses to see.

602
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,825
What a joy it was;

603
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:31,285
what a joy.

604
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:32,445
You can’t imagine.

605
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:36,485
Even our Ambassador in Spain said, “The people here are very different, Mother.”

606
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:42,165
He said, “I talked to some people. They said, ‘When She is coming you have to call us.’”

607
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:46,085
I said, “Next year you have a big program. This year let’s have only the Indians.

608
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,245
But next year, of course, you can call.”

609
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:51,625
You see, all of them here want to have Realisation.

610
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:54,285
All big people, eminent people.

611
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,665
You just come next year and you’ll see all of them.

612
00:36:57,445 --> 00:37:00,305
Here, do you think anybody?

613
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,705
An ambassador, can you imagine?

614
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,445
I can’t think.

615
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,645
Very funny people.

616
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:18,005
I’ve met a very big man once in a dinner party

617
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:24,925
where one of the Sahaja yogis is the chairman of the Hague High Court, of course an Indian, Dr. Nagen Singh.

618
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,865
And he told that gentleman that,

619
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:34,485
“This lady is a very well-known spiritual leader of India and She has given Realisation to many

620
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,265
and She has given Realisation to me also.”

621
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:42,125
He looked at me and he said, “No, I am also a realised-soul.”

622
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,405
What to say?

623
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,365
He said, “Christ has given me Realisation.

624
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,485
It’s Christ who is going to give me.”

625
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:58,325
So Nagen Singh in Hindi says,“There are no vibrations,the Kundalini is frozen

626
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:02,185
and this one is saying. How can Christ give him Realisation?”

627
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,225
I said, “This is the escape because Christ is no more.”

628
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:09,345
Of course, Christ gives him but where is Christ within himself?

629
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:13,045
So he asked him, “Where is Christ within yourself?”

630
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,925
“That Christ knows himself.”

631
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:23,205
He said, “I didn’t know these people were such buffoons.”

632
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,345
Really, these were his words.

633
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:29,045
And my husband then couldn’t bear it any more

634
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:33,105
He said “Now, forget it.” You see, he was such a blind man.

635
00:38:33,405 --> 00:38:37,025
I mean, in India people may not get Realisation,

636
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:39,825
may not, but they know what is Realisation.

637
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,165
They know who is truthful,

638
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:44,225
I must say.

639
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:47,525
Whether they are ambassadors or Presidents, make no difference;

640
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:51,085
they know that definitely.

641
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:53,605
Even President of India, say,

642
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:56,045
if he sees me he doesn’t sit down.

643
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:57,765
He’ll stand up.

644
00:38:58,565 --> 00:38:59,745
They have that sense.

645
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,925
That basic humility is missing.

646
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,185
That’s why we take to people who pamper our ego.

647
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:09,185
We take to people who are nonsensical.

648
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,885
We take to people who befool us.

649
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,745
Only the egoistical can be befooled.

650
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,685
If you are not egoistical no one can befool you

651
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:25,765
How do you befool a person?

652
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,225
By pampering the ego.

653
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,485
So one has to understand

654
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:35,765
that unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves

655
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:38,985
we are not going to do very well in England.

656
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:43,325
It’s for all the Sahaja yogis as well as for people who have come here.

657
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:48,005
It’s a very, very, serious problem,

658
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:57,725
and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe that is this England, that’s the Heart.

659
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:03,525
And if you now any way escape your responsibility,

660
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:06,265
you will be held responsible,

661
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:10,765
I am telling you now very strongly.

662
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,845
Because today I had big lectures from people saying that,

663
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:17,885
“Mother, you don’t say things strongly, and people are to be frightened.”

664
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:21,745
I don’t want to frighten you but you will be held responsible,

665
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:22,685
take it from me.

666
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:24,445
You are born on this Earth,

667
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:26,005
on this

668
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:27,245
great land

669
00:40:27,585 --> 00:40:29,585
for a very great purpose,

670
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:32,065
to create Jerusalem out of that.

671
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:35,065
And now if you are not going to stand up,

672
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:38,545
you’ll be held responsible.

673
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:40,605
This is what it is.

674
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,645
It’s a tremendous work one has to do,

675
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:48,245
for which you must prepare yourself

676
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:49,685
Get to it.

677
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,645
I can give Realisation;  that’s all.

678
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,885
But I can’t give you strength.

679
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,885
I mean, you can’t make the horse stand up on his forelegs, can you?

680
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:03,725
It’s a very, very, desperate situation sometimes the way things happen.

681
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:11,445
After all, you must know that My coming here has some meaning of.

682
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:14,045
I didn’t come here because

683
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,485
I chose to come in the way people,

684
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,725
the gurus walk into your country.

685
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:24,045
I came here because something was done spontaneously.

686
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:28,585
I had to stay here, I had to work for you,

687
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:34,445
I had to implore you and request you and tell you in every way possible your responsibility.

688
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:40,145
But then you don’t tell me because I have not failed in my duties as far as I’m concerned.

689
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,625
Of that I am very sure.

690
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,005
But now I’ll leave it to you

691
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,285
because I may not be here next year. What can you say?

692
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,205
Depends on the moods.

693
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:55,325
But we have to see what you are going to do for the whole world,

694
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:59,625
for the whole emancipation of the human being.

695
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,745
First you have to find your own beauty

696
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,525
and you have to give this beauty to others.

697
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:09,005
This is a greatest artist’s job you have to do,

698
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:12,725
as a great master of art in divine life.

699
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:15,285
You have to become divine.

700
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,465
It’s you who has to become divine.

701
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:18,945
You don’t worry about me.

702
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:22,685
I don’t have to achieve anything.

703
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:24,145
That’s the only problem.

704
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:29,485
I don’t have to achieve it.

705
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:32,745
I have to only achieve you people.

706
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:41,605
I have to only have ways and methods by which I could really make you grow.

707
00:42:43,305 --> 00:42:51,645
All that is possible I will do, but you must stand up on your legs, must ask for it.

708
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:55,685
It’s a big problem.

709
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,665
Not for others; for me.

710
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,185
Because others have no such problem.

711
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,065
They don’t want you to stand on your legs.

712
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,165
They want you to crawl and they want you to disappear.

713
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:07,765
This is a different thing. I want you to grow,

714
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:13,065
not because I want, but Divine wants it.

715
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,945
The whole Creation wants it.

716
00:43:17,065 --> 00:43:18,505
Otherwise it will have no meaning.

717
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:22,345
So the responsibility of English Sahaja yogis,

718
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:25,345
British Sahaja yogis is very great.

719
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:31,245
Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible,

720
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,325
that establish yourself.

721
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:36,645
You are lagging behind.

722
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:39,845
I can tell you Spanish people will have to come and teach you Sahaja Yoga.

723
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:43,665
Already we have got somebody from Australia to teach that.

724
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:48,885
You give up your old ideas and conditioning.

725
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:53,585
Every Saturday, Sunday, must you go out of the country, out of London?

726
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:56,205
London is your place where you have to work.

727
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:02,405
Unless and until you take it up upon yourself it’s not going to work out.

728
00:44:05,825 --> 00:44:08,405
Some people have to do it, someone.

729
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:17,705
I am looking out for such people for whom this is their desire.

730
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:22,825
We talk of big things. If we talk to anyone, I see in big, big parties they talk,

731
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:25,845
“Oh, what’s this?” and “We must become peaceful countries.

732
00:44:25,845 --> 00:44:27,705
We must do this and that must happen.”

733
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:34,625
And even if you’ll listen to the lecture of our great President of America,

734
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:37,285
you find, “Oh God, some angel is speaking,” or what?

735
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,105
Like an angel, they speak.

736
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:46,185
Angelic, prophetic, such big, big, words. I can’t understand even

737
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:53,225
it won’t come into the mouth of God Himself but the way people talk, ultimately what remains is nothing.

738
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,445
So let us be that, what we talk.

739
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:01,985
We can be.

740
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,205
We all can be. It’s very simple.

741
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:08,165
You have to decide.

742
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:11,905
You have to really decide. The time has come.

743
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:18,065
I just pray may God give you strength to stand with the truth.

744
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:19,285
It’s not difficult.

745
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:24,245
It’s very joy-giving. But stand with it, grow with it.

746
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:28,965
That’s what you are. Thank you very much.

747
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:39,405
Now if you have any questions you can ask me and we should have Realisation.

748
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:40,225
Hello.

749
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:49,945
What’s that? What’s that here?

750
00:45:55,485 --> 00:46:00,105
Right Swadisthana. She’s showing right Swadisthana.

751
00:46:04,485 --> 00:46:08,805
Oh, all right. Now you take this one.

752
00:46:32,905 --> 00:46:37,725
They are fighting. They are fighting, see, working it out.

753
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:41,165
They are all fighting.

754
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,685
How is your child,[Graham]?

755
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:57,405
That same thing?

756
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:58,945
Much less.

757
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:02,625
Your Agnya? Have you brought her?

758
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:08,605
No, because I haven’t the right, because she has [just come out of / to stay in the] hospital two or three weeks.

759
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:12,965
“All right. On my way back if we have time I will go for see her.

760
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,605
That child is fighting.

761
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:23,405
What sufferings from the very beginning of life.

762
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:27,365
That house also I think has problems.

763
00:47:33,765 --> 00:47:40,005
No questions? Are there any questions please?

764
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:48,985
Yes?

765
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:59,205
I’m from Holland and I wonder whether I should try to stay in England, in London for, should I remain in England to find work? ”

766
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:01,985
It’s difficult to find?

767
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:10,005
I am wondering whether I should try to find work here in England or, do you understand what I am saying?

768
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:11,145
You are English?

769
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,125
No, Holland.

770
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:12,745
Yes?

771
00:48:12,825 --> 00:48:13,525
Holland.

772
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:14,285
Holland?

773
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:17,605
Yes.Oh, we need people in Holland.

774
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:20,965
I haven’t yet touched it.

775
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,065
Excuse me?

776
00:48:22,145 --> 00:48:24,145
I haven’t yet touched Holland.

777
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:29,705
Haven’t been there. I went there once, a long time back, but we have to touch Holland

778
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,585
There are lots of seekers, no doubt, but

779
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,125
drinking too much.

780
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:46,425
Yeah. They drink too much, they told me, like Scotland, see,

781
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:50,225
chana. All right, you eat chana

782
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:55,205
and we have to look after them, no doubt.

783
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,965
There are lots of seekers misled there are.

784
00:48:58,525 --> 00:49:00,525
In Holland we have one great soul.

785
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:03,985
There’s a young boy of sixteen years, I think. Careen, his name is.

786
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:06,865
They asked him about his father, mother, everything.

787
00:49:07,465 --> 00:49:09,705
He said, “my father is just like other fathers.”

788
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:12,725
I said, “Really? What does he do?”

789
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:17,345
“In the daytime he drinks beer. In the night he drinks whisky.”

790
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:21,845
I said, “Really?” “All fathers do that, Mother.”

791
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:24,585
“And what about the children?”

792
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:30,685
“Some of us, our friends, we meditate but most of them also are drinking beer.”

793
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:34,645
When he was twelve years he first came.

794
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:36,565
I think twelve or eight years he came here, I think.

795
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:38,645
Yes, and he must be sixteen now, yes.

796
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:42,305
Wonderful man. He is growing up there.

797
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:45,385
I told him to gather more people who think like him.

798
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:48,045
He might, he is a great person.

799
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:53,965
His mother is French and father is this thing and divorced and another mother,

800
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:55,225
all kinds of problems.

801
00:49:56,725 --> 00:50:00,205
No, would be better in Holland, no doubt, but you get your Realisation,

802
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:04,805
you settle down here and we must start a centre in Holland and next year I am coming down there,

803
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:06,105
all right?

804
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:10,185
Holland is one place I have not been. I didn’t go to Austria.

805
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:13,005
Now, we have a very powerful yogi there. So I am going this year.

806
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:15,505
A few countries I have not tackled.

807
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,645
We should not go away from our country.

808
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:19,065
We should work there.

809
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:21,605
That’s the place we have to work, whatever is the condition.

810
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:27,165
Switzerland now are doing very well. Switzerland is doing so well.

811
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:32,245
Those who were committing suicide are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and doing very well.

812
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:37,165
I said, “The way you [are/were] doing suicide, if you can do Sahaja Yoga even once it will be all right.”

813
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:42,405
Because they did a perfect job always with their suicide things.

814
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:47,225
They used to plan it out so well, the suicide,

815
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:52,265
in such a way, I mean, that it would not create any problems for anyone and sort of thing.

816
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:59,505
They used to think about it all the time, how to commit suicide, and they, very great planning.

817
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:02,885
But look at Switzerland.

818
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:06,505
It’s a challenge to all of you.

819
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:17,205
So it’s a good idea.

820
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:21,845
You get your Sahaja Yoga here, settle down, master it and go to Holland.

821
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:27,605
You would be the one of the—- I gave once a Realisation to one Mr. called August Tigger.

822
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:33,305
He was the chairman of your, one of your very big companies.

823
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:39,365
He was a very big man, no doubt, but he told me that,

824
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:43,785
“I cannot talk about to anyone. They will think I have gone crazy.”

825
00:51:46,165 --> 00:51:47,165
And he died.

826
00:51:47,285 --> 00:51:49,285
He was a very old man when I met him.

827
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:52,525
He was about eighty years of age when I first met him.

828
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:01,205
And a very great seeker he was, very great seeker.

829
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:08,285
Holland I’ll definitely come, no doubt.

830
00:52:09,285 --> 00:52:11,285
And now we have reached Brussels also.

831
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,185
So in Brussels and Holland we can do it, isn’t it?

832
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:18,205
From Brussels it is easier to go to Amsterdam.

833
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,965
Where will you be in Holland?

834
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,965
I have no place at all.

835
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:23,565
Huh.

836
00:52:23,565 --> 00:52:25,565
have no place [where] to go for the moment.

837
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:29,445
But you will be placed in Holland?

838
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,605
Then I have to go back. I have to.

839
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:33,225
Yes, you should, you should.

840
00:52:33,385 --> 00:52:39,985
You see, I would request you, once you become a Sahaja yogi, you should go there,

841
00:52:40,145 --> 00:52:42,145
and we’ll send some people to help you also.

842
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,625
There is somebody very powerful in Brussels,

843
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:48,125
Very powerful in Brussels, who’ll help you, very powerful.

844
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:50,645
You remember that Rajneesh fellow who came?

845
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,105
Oh, he’s so powerful.

846
00:52:54,105 --> 00:52:55,245
You must see that.

847
00:52:55,585 --> 00:53:00,945
He’s brought about ten people from Brussels to Lille.

848
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:04,485
Can you imagine?

849
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:07,325
He’s already started his own centre.

850
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:17,385
It can only work in the democratic countries, isn’t it?

851
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:19,885
And I think Holland is very important.

852
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:24,805
And who is there is Dr Nagen Singh himself, is there in Holland.

853
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:26,045
He’s in Hague.

854
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,145
Is he?

855
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,685
