00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:04,079
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,190
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

3
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:11,907
He went back just for last three years

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,720
and people fixed Him to a cross.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,560
It was somewhat destined.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,400
To open Agnya chakra

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,560
He had to offer this sacrifice.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,880
So in this way He

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,000
set up Agnya chakra.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,960
Agnya chakra is very

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
constricted

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,360
small

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,200
and not easily openable,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,560
because a human being

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,400
got freedom

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,920
that made him egoistic.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,680
This ego

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,880
constricted his Agnya chakra.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,199
And from that

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,253
constricted Agnya chakra

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,182
it was necessary to take out ego.

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,400
And to take out ego

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,960
you have to control your (MAAN).

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,360
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,400
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,160
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
and the ego will go on increasing

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
We do !

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,840
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
the ego will shoot up because

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,960
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Those who think

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
that to our ego

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
will suppress

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,160
will eat less food

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,640
worldwide violence

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,440
one

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
standing on one foot and some on their head.

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,680
Every type of

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
experiment

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,600
people do to destroy their ego

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,640
But it does not supress the ego.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
It shoots up.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,720
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
everything

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,880
shoots up ego !

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,160
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Because Agni is right sided.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
Whatever

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,160
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,000
For the past thousands of years human beings

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,640
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,080
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,840
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,080
There is no need to do any karmakand.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,120
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
As I said

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,640
that to take away your ego

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,760
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,920
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,280
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,560
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,280
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
All this

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,680
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,040
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

69
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,400
It is for sick people.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,000
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,760
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,160
I said it is human being's nature

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,200
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,035
because of my karmakand, work will be done

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,479
and in this karmakand

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,333
not only you

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,527
in foreign country also

78
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,671
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

79
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,560
For example

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,840
will go to church once a year.

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,960
Means today.

82
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,760
After that they don't take even the name of God.

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,200
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,840
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,120
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

86
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
If you can understand that this wrong act

87
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,000
What we have done is wrong

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,520
If you can understand this

90
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,000
your brain will retain it

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Now,

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,800
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,160
One thing is that they are misers number one.

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,800
If you talk to them about ten rupees

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
they start jumping into the sky.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,320
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,640
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,040
That your ego will dissolve easily.

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,720
For example somebody

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,560
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,960
tell him in a low voice

102
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,599
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,700
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,600
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

105
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
So he cools down.

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,560
I did this, i did that, i

107
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,600
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,560
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,480
But it is surprising

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,280
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,200
more than them egoistic I have not seen

112
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
particularly English.

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
American

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
everybody

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
is so much egoistic

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,760
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,711
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

118
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,664
that should be thought

119
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,319
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,560
and He has taught

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,240
that now

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
love everybody

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,080
love your enemies too.

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,520
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
and apart from 'Love'

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,520
there is no remedy.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
But this 'Love'

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,280
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

129
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,360
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

130
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,480
knock the door and the door will open !

131
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,240
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,200
It means open the doors of your heart.

133
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,400
A peson whose heart is small

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
those who are misers

135
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,240
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,480
And another thing which is very important

137
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,920
if you get angry

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,840
it means that you have too much ego.

139
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,120
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

141
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,200
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

142
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,280
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

143
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,240
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

144
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,960
no desire

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,200
those who completely know to love selflessly

146
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

147
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,480
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
I am tired of them.

149
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,876
They will start something on their own

150
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,480
and they won't even tell me.

151
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,280
and by doing so

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Today thousands of questions have risen

153
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,320
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

154
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,400
once they

155
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,200
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

156
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,119
that we are getting land only this much.

157
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,880
How much did we charge ?

158
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,400
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

159
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
And no Sahajyogi told me.

160
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,200
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

161
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,800
leave that person.

162
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,040
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

163
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,160
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

164
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,720
Now those who have given them money

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,360
are holding their heads

166
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,880
that they have been cheated !

167
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,920
How to get back that money ?

168
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,640
Without asking Me all the work

169
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Absolutely without asking Me.

170
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,560
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

171
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,000
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,560
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

173
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
and ask Me

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,760
they made a society of their own

175
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
and became mad

176
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
that they are getting land

177
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,080
It is such a bad land

178
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,480
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

179
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

180
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

181
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,480
and for that I am not responsible.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
But you ask for your money back.

183
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,480
It is none of My resposibility.

184
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Jesus Christ had said that

185
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
those people

186
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
make houses

187
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
live in houses

188
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,800
they should watch birds

189
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,760
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

190
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,600
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

191
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,440
and when they make their home

192
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,240
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

193
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,560
He explained it in every way

194
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
that you give up attatchment.

195
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
This is my house.

196
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,600
This is my land.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
They are my children.

198
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,989
Even this much that it is my country.

199
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,120
This attatchment should be given up.

200
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Then only you can be great.

201
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,800
In the whole world you are

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
brothers and sisters.

203
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,080
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

204
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Not at all !

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,480
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

206
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,592
Within you there should be devotion to country.

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,359
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,600
If there is no devotion to one's country

209
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,840
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

210
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,840
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

211
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,719
If you are working  against your country

212
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,760
you are not devoted to it.

213
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
Jesus Christ

214
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
had no need to go back.

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
He had said also

216
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,120
That there live such people

217
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,200
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

218
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,920
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

219
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,800
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

220
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,960
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

221
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,080
It is mad people's country.

222
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
He didn't need to learn anything.

223
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,680
But had to teach something.

224
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,600
That is why He went there.

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
and for the same reason

226
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
His end was this way.

227
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,400
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

228
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,760
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
If against anyone you have

230
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,360
any ill feeling

231
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
against anyone

232
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
anger

233
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,480
or

234
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,520
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

235
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,720
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

236
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Whatever you have to do

237
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
you have to do with love.

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,360
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

239
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

240
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,760
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

241
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,960
To children

242
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,400
you have to perfectly

243
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,320
discipline

244
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,000
If you cannot discipline children

245
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,920
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

246
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,440
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

247
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,120
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

248
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,800
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

249
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,120
But He was so disciplined

250
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,560
In this way

251
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,880
tolerated

252
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,440
and from His life He showed

253
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,800
He didn't need to be married

254
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,760
He didn't marry

255
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

256
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,440
People have such wrong notions

257
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
And that is why

258
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
they have self made notions

259
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,200
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

260
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,680
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

261
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,200
How can anyone be married to Him ?

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Apart from that

263
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,520
Men also no to marry

264
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,200
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

265
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,160
With that everyone can be kept under control

266
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
but one cannot become Christian.

267
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,440
like such

268
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

269
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
to cover oneself

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,800
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

271
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,760
They forgot Jesus !

272
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,920
and created a religion out of their own

273
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
and call it Christian religion.

274
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,720
The Christian religion of today

275
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

276
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
Because I was born in this religion

277
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,720
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

278
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,480
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

279
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,600
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

280
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,400
Because your various gurus, real gurus

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,920
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

282
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,360
are your many incarnations

283
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,680
and your Sayambus are many.

284
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,800
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

285
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,840
Only Jesus and Bible

286
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,280
They can be fundamentalists.

287
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,960
And they can be Yahudis also

288
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,920
And all the three are related to each other.

289
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,240
It is written in books.

290
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,720
But a Hindu can never be communal.

291
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,200
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

292
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

293
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,800
Others  Renuka Devi.

294
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,520
Some to Krishna.

295
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,800
So, every person

296
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,760
every family individually

297
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,160
adore incarnation, books.

298
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,800
As such there is no book

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,080
which can be called as Holy Bible.

300
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,800
So to all the religions

301
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,760
a Hindu should pay respect.

302
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
I have noticed

303
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,400
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

304
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,840
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

305
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,680
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

306
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
That Bible fell on the floor.

307
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,000
There was one Hindu with us.

308
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,960
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

309
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,520
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

310
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,200
The Christians will do so.

311
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
A Hindu will never do so.

312
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,800
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

313
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,360
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

314
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,680
Those who are our politicians

315
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,960
such people have taken birth.

316
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

317
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,000
same way some people have come out.

318
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,480
But they are not Hindus.

319
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,880
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

320
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,160
North Indians don't know it at all.

321
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
And those

322
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
who are South Indians

323
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,480
they know that bramhins have to be given money

324
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,480
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

325
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,080
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

326
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,120
They are so karmakandi.

327
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,160
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

328
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,880
Everything was waste.

329
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,640
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

330
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
They cannot give it up.

331
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,800
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

332
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,320
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

333
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
Now what do I see that there one mile long

334
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,960
long lines one mile long

335
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,960
are standing on Tuesday.

336
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,000
Gneshji too must have slept.

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,360
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

338
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,600
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

339
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,920
And in North India also

340
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,120
I have seen

341
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,560
that some people are Karmakandi.

342
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,720
And those who are Karmakandi

343
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,720
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

344
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,240
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

345
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,120
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

346
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,400
but respect everything.

347
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,960
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

348
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,520
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

349
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,840
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

350
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,640
Everbody's respect

351
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,400
and unnecessary

352
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,160
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

353
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,360
Now a day's false gurus

354
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

355
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,280
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

356
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,840
Do Havana

357
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,760
108 times daily read these names, those names

358
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,680
giving you mantras, doing this that.

359
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,040
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

360
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,800
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

361
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,680
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

362
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
a human being becomes egoistic.

363
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,800
and to crack this ego,

364
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,080
To Karmakand, He

365
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,680
had totally forbidden.

366
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,280
The same way, in the name of God

367
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,400
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

368
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,160
On the contrary reverse process started.

369
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,400
Earn money and consume.

370
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,280
They don't give up earning

371
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,800
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

372
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,640
It doesn't solve any problem.

373
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Today in Sahajyoga work

374
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,320
We should remember

375
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,400
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

376
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,760
How much money did we give?

377
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,960
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

378
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,240
Even they

379
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

380
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,440
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

381
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
And if you want

382
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,040
you can give realisation to so many people.

383
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

384
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,960
But the people should not be half baked.

385
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,520
They should be deep.

386
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,160
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

387
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,120
And for that the greatest thing is

388
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,320
that how much we love them.

389
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,200
And how much love they give to others.

390
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,240
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

391
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,320
he should remember first of all

392
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,200
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

393
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,800
Am i doing that ?

394
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,120
I shower my anger over everyone.

395
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,920
I keep everybody under control

396
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,000
I express my anger with my eyes.

397
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
This ego is

398
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
very much

399
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,200
not only against  Sahajyoga

400
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,320
but his destructor

401
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,600
Whosoever is egoistic

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,560
should lessen it and replace it with love

403
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
Life will be  a pleasure.

404
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
Life will be beautiful !

405
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,040
If you don't know how to love

406
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

407
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
First you open the doors of your heart.

408
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,540
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

409
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,199
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

410
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,960
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

411
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,397
It will never spread.

412
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,720
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

413
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,720
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

414
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,880
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

415
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,960
because most of the people are here Indians

416
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,360
Some of them are Marathis

417
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,080
and others are from North India.

418
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,040
I was telling them about Christ.

419
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
What was His power ?

420
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
His power was of 'Love'.

421
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,240
And not of anger

422
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,800
Because He is the one

423
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,360
who has crossed

424
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,120
the most difficult center of Agnya.

425
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,280
Those people who have ego

426
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,520
never realise they have ego

427
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,320
With their ego they do

428
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,960
all kinds of nonsensical things.

429
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
Without asking Me

430
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,520
they have done something in Delhi.

431
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,200
Without asking me

432
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,320
they have done something in Russia.

433
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,240
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

434
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,840
that they don't realise

435
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
what they have done is the crime

436
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,400
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

437
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,400
If you want to do anything you must

438
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,400
tell me beforehand.

439
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,880
You must consult Me

440
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,560
you must talk to Me

441
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,840
Because I know what is happening.

442
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,960
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

443
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,200
Then how will you know if you were

444
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,360
so sensitive you would find out

445
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,760
You would have asked Me,

446
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
'Mother what should we do ?'

447
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
At least ask Me.

448
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,560
This is the main thing missing among

449
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,840
Sahajyogis now that

450
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,240
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

451
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,800
If you make somebody a leader

452
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,080
it is very dangerous sometimes.

453
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,920
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

454
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,080
It is a very difficult thing.

455
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,320
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

456
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,480
Anything is possible.

457
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,320
So before you do anything like that

458
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
you have to consult (Me).

459
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,680
I am still living

460
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,360
and you can ask.

461
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,080
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

462
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,240
At least I am there to tell you.

463
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,560
But then you have to develop

464
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
your balance and your love.

465
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,600
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

466
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,200
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

467
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,680
You can develop that discretion.

468
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,280
special

469
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
.....powers.

470
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Even if somebody telephones to Me

471
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,080
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

472
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,680
I don't say that you can become like Me.

473
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,160
But at least you have vibrations to see.

474
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,000
Also see your own vibrations.

475
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,320
How are you moving ?

476
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,520
Put a paper on your hand

477
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,360
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

478
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,440
With this ego

479
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,040
you cannot go further

480
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

481
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
You came here not to become

482
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,400
some sort of a leader

483
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,280
or some sort of a

484
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,120
a king but

485
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,040
you came here

486
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,480
to become a great guru.

487
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,320
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

488
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,840
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

489
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,800
a complete humility

490
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,400
natural humility

491
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,760
natural balance.

492
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,520
This is what Christ has taught us.

493
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,960
At that time

494
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't think that people had that much ego.

495
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,120
Ego is a modern present to you.

496
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,520
People get ego out of anything.

497
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,320
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

498
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,280
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

499
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,960
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

500
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

501
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
For that she had ego.

502
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
What is so great

503
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,560
than to be a good sahajyogi

504
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,320
You may be the king, you may be anything.

505
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
Now you see the Prime Ministers

506
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,280
and all of them going to jail.

507
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,920
What are they compared to you?

508
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,240
They have no balance.

509
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,160
They have no sense.

510
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,320
What makes you a separate

511
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,760
individuals

512
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,320
higher people, because

513
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,360
you have no ego.

514
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,160
Now people try to remove their ego

515
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,720
Their two types.....

516
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,600
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

517
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,440
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

518
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,840
But all this we do with our mind.

519
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,080
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

520
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,600
They become ascetic.

521
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,160
They are the greatest egoist.

522
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,440
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

523
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,640
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

524
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,920
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

525
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,280
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

526
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,840
all this asceticism.

527
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,680
You have to be loving

528
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,400
affectionate

529
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,960
kind and disciplined.

530
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,920
I must say this because when you are loving

531
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,320
you go out of bounds sometimes

532
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,199
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

533
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,240
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

534
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

535
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,320
You must have your balance through your discipline.

536
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,160
If you have no discipline

537
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,600
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

538
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,040
From the life of Christ

539
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,880
we have to learn

540
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,760
these things

541
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
that unless and until we have these things

542
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,520
we cannot

543
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,800
become good Sahajyogis.

544
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,960
Firstly, ritualistic nature

545
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,160
secondly, anger

546
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,280
thirdly, miserliness.

547
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,280
like

548
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,920
if you

549
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,400
go to England

550
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,800
it is written there

551
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,360
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

552
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,160
this is what it is.

553
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,800
Miserliness

554
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,160
where can we save money,

555
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,879
'Mother, can you give concession?'

556
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,880
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

557
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,000
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

558
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,960
''I am not using your money''.

559
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,367
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

560
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,760
of course My money also and your money.

561
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,320
So many things I have done

562
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,520
The whole of Vashi

563
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
the whole of Ashram

564
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
In Delhi two ashrams,

565
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,320
then the whole of school

566
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,200
and also

567
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,000
land in Pune and other places.

568
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,640
Now in Pune they want Me

569
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
to pay the land, to pay for everything

570
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,080
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

571
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
to be great

572
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
miserly, kanjoos people.

573
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,800
Even for their own

574
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,000
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

575
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,360
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

576
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,800
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

577
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,400
Very very miserly people.

578
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,000
Miserly people can never love.

579
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,200
Tthey love money.

580
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,960
Egoistical people can never love

581
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,920
because they love power

582
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,440
to control others.

583
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,440
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

584
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,120
but not.

585
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,840
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

586
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,280
no use working for Sahajyoga.

587
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,120
Look at The Christ

588
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,000
He took birth in a very humble

589
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,720
abode.

590
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,840
But He was the king.

591
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,400
And He lived with the poor

592
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,600
and tried to save them.

593
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
He saved the lepers.

594
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
He saved so many people, there were.

595
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

596
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,920
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

597
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,600
But what is important is if you are curing

598
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,200
you know that you are not curing

599
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,120
It is the Divine power that is curing.

600
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
You are not doing anything

601
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,320
It is best to be like that.

602
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

603
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,520
and I am Nishkriya

604
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,240
doing nothing.

605
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,920
but I am not lazy.

606
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,600
You should be active but all your activity

607
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,160
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

608
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,080
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

609
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,160
You extend your heart

610
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,320
extend your money

611
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,560
house, everything for 'Love'

612
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,520
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

613
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,000
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

614
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,560
Teach her how to be kind and generous

615
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,832
otherway round for the husband.

616
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,227
It is very important

617
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,480
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

618
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,628
and sweet to others.

619
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,040
Christ only once went into temper

620
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
which He had a right to do that

621
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
when He saw people

622
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,640
selling things in the temple.

623
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,440
Samething we have here.

624
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,960
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

625
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,399
But you only go and buy things from them because

626
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,479
you have a habit of shopping.

627
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,520
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

628
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
is a habit

629
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,080
shopping they must do.

630
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,960
They will not see the greenery

631
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,920
the beauty of nature, nothing.

632
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,760
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

633
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
with my husband

634
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,800
I had to go

635
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,960
and see beautiful places like museums.

636
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,680
I never used to shop.

637
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,439
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

638
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,346
So I would go for shops.

639
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,560
But not the way that

640
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,640
that every place is for shopping.

641
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,960
What is there to shop here

642
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,480
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

643
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,440
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

644
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,240
This is the holier than holi.

645
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,160
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

646
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,040
I have told them not to have shops

647
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,560
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

648
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

649
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Nothing essential to buy there.

650
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,480
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

651
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,360
Here you have come for your worship.

652
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,440
In our Mahalaxmi temple

653
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,880
there are people who are selling

654
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,680
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

655
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,560
But they say it is for the Goddess.

656
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,120
And they buy there.

657
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,000
All the people who are coming stupidly

658
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,000
and give it

659
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
to the brahmin in the temple

660
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,840
and the Brahmin sells it back

661
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,760
at a lower price.

662
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,960
And these garlands are

663
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,720
I don't know how many times sold and bought

664
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,920
and sold and bought because of the

665
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,320
stupidity of the people who go there.

666
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,880
If they have to take something

667
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,867
they should buy it from outside,

668
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,840
not at the place where you have come.

669
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,360
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

670
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,480
or you came to Bombay

671
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,360
you could have bought there but not in this place.

672
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,040
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

673
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,440
otherwise why should we come here.

674
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
That is why christ took a hunter

675
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,000
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

676
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,880
Now they don't have

677
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,160
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

678
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,720
They have outside.

679
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,920
But they sell other things

680
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,440
like catholic church sells

681
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,560
a wine called Benedictine.

682
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,760
Imagine !

683
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,400
That is another story.

684
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,320
Christ went

685
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,200
for wedding

686
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,520
and they had no wine.

687
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,640
Now in the Hibru language

688
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,040
wine

689
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,760
means

690
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,600
the juice of the grapes.

691
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,320
It doesn't mean fermented.

692
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,400
So He converted water into black wine.

693
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,160
You cannot convert

694
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,960
water instatantaneously

695
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,920
into wine.

696
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,520
Wine has to rot , has to smell

697
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,080
The more it smells, the best it is.

698
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,960
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

699
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,720
He never said that.

700
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,960
He just converted it into wine.

701
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,160
meaning

702
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,400
the

703
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,520
taste of the juice of grapes.

704
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,320
Once I went

705
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,520
to some television

706
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,200
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

707
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,400
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

708
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,600
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

709
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,080
" Now you drink it".

710
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,320
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

711
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,840
I said,"This is what Christ did".

712
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,320
He got his realisation.

713
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,560
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

714
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,320
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

715
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,360
If somebody is born, they will drink.

716
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,240
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

717
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,239
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

718
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,920
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

719
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,919
Their attention has become nice.

720
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,800
The whole thing is changed.

721
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,560
This is the transformation that has worked

722
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,520
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

723
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,800
everybody has talked about this particular time

724
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
when people will get transformed.

725
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,200
But even after transformation

726
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,880
you do not want to become what you have to be

727
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,806
for which you have come here.

728
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,640
You will be left behind.

729
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,447
It is a big

730
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,463
transformation is taking place.

731
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,256
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

732
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,600
There is a big evolution going on

733
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,840
and those who will not evolve properly

734
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,360
will be left behind.

735
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,840
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

736
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,331
And you will be judged.

737
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,320
You will be left behind.

738
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,320
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

739
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
With your weight you will fall down.

740
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,960
So for you

741
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,920
to understand Christ

742
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,000
is all these qualities you must have.

743
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,920
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

744
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,160
But if you are not, then you need not.

745
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,800
You must know what you are.

746
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,360
First of all introspect.

747
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,760
Accordingly you should work it out.

748
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,720
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

749
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,920
I would love all my children.

750
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,640
To be extremely loving and collective.

751
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,560
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

752
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,360
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

753
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,520
I know what is what !

754
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,560
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

755
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,320
and say i have measured somebody.

756
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,663
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

757
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,080
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

758
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,520
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

759
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,679
You have to tell me.

760
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,800
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

761
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,559
but you should ask.

762
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,439
I know about everyone.

763
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,240
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

764
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,240
You can write to me.

765
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:30,639
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

766
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,560
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

767
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,439
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

768
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,720
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

769
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,960
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

770
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,240
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

771
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:59,520
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

772
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,400
All: "I need money, I have no money.

773
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

774
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,280
You can ask on my photograph.

775
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,040
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

776
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,200
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

777
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,629
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

778
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,040
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

779
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,080
but you must deserve it.

780
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,880
So many miracles have taken place.

781
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,480
So many people have been cured no doubt.

782
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,000
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

783
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,760
Don't get into the trap of ego.

784
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,680
That is most dangerous.

785
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,440
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

786
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,240
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

787
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,320
Put your hands to your heart

788
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,640
and to say

789
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
''Mother, We love,

790
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,760
We spread your Divine Love,

791
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,520
encompass the whole world,

792
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,280
give realisation to all the people.

793
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,120
Will not shout,

794
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,640
will not be angry,

795
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,880
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

796
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,400
Surrender our ego

797
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,040
surrender ego

798
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,960
surrender your ego.

799
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,360
All your problems can be solved.

800
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,680
because, as long as, there is ego

801
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,280
this divine power doesn't take over.

802
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,120
You may do anything

803
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,200
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

804
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,760
Christ is missing. He is no more.

805
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,040
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

806
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,880
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

807
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,360
love your children and love your house.

808
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,120
You have to love everyone.

809
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,280
Try to make everyone happy.

810
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,880
That is why I like music

811
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,120
because through music you can spread vibrations.

812
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,280
Very good media of spreading vibrations

813
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,039
of loving vibrations.

814
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,320
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

815
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,637
not hot tempered

816
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,645
not showing off

817
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,160
not thinking too much of themselves.

818
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,000
All these will work

819
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,800
very well if you understand

820
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
that this Divine power

821
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,120
is so powerful.

822
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,200
No doubt it is love,

823
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
no doubt it is truth,

824
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,000
and no doubt

825
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,600
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

826
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,800
and you could be finished.

827
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,400
It is a very very

828
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,680
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

829
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,160
power you have within yourself.

830
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,080
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

831
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,840
sacrificed his body for our sake

832
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,600
that our agnya is opened up.

833
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

834
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,160
But in this area

835
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,600
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

836
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,640
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

837
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,040
They did it.

838
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,800
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

839
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,000
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

840
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,599
In two three months they have learnt so much,

841
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,800
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

842
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,360
For Indian music

843
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,960
had to really starve.

844
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
For months together they had to practice

845
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,720
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

846
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,880
That is all over now.

847
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,480
because of this Param Chaitanya

848
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,480
and your power

849
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,080
to be one with the Divine.

850
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,880
This Divine power can transform you completely

851
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,760
to such an extent

852
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,840
that anything that you want to do,

853
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,800
you can do it in two, three months.

854
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,920
In Pune when they were singing

855
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,000
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

856
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,440
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

857
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,040
So they were singing.

858
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,920
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

859
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,880
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

860
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,120
Because how could these people

861
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,720
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

862
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,200
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

863
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,320
But they are so good at it

864
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,160
is very surprising.

865
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,720
Now all this has happened in your presence,

866
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,280
in your presence.

867
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,247
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

868
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,440
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

869
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,840
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

870
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,560
should be finished.

871
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:54,000
(clapping)

872
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,600
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

873
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,480
But I know My English may not be so good

874
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,600
but best is to learn hindi,

875
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,520
if possible.

876
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,040
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

877
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,600
and so many languages in another country.

878
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,759
Every country has a different type of English language.

879
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,560
If you go to America,

880
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,960
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

881
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,600
Because they go on

882
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,240
taking their

883
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,240
....tongue

884
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,200
and lips on one side, then on another side.

885
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,360
English of the French is another point.

886
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,640
So best is to learn Hindi.

887
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,320
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

888
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,040
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

889
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,600
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

890
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,080
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

891
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,360
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

892
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,720
But Hindi is very easy.

893
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,680
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

894
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,360
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

895
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,320
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

896
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,840
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

897
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,760
to an English man."

898
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,160
I said," Why this advise ?"

899
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,119
He said," There was an English man who was after me

900
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,466
that i should teach him Hindi."

901
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,000
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

902
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,000
or to close the door.''

903
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,560
So for open the door he said you say

904
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,600
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

905
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,268
(clapping)

906
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,360
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

907
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,680
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

908
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,720
But now it is different.

909
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,280
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

910
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,320
Very quickly, I can see that.

911
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,440
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

912
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,360
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

913
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,960
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

914
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,079
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

915
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,600
Marathi is very difficult.

916
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,040
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

917
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,427
I think that is one of the best languages

918
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:54,920
to put down your ego.

919
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,639
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

920
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,160
because in their language it is built in process.

921
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,080
For example somebody is boasting,

922
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,360
that I have done this, I have done that.

923
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,400
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

924
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,600
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

925
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,119
Then the person is finished.

926
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,760
Like that there are many words by which

927
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,040
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

928
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,600
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

929
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,919
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

930
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,400
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

931
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,640
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

932
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
there is 'Adab'.

933
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,720
'Adab' means modesty

934
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,640
and respect

935
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,960
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

936
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,640
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

937
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,560
there is respect and a way to address others,

938
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,640
to address others.

939
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,760
All this

940
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,960
will give you

941
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,480
a kind of a more

942
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,760
flexible vehichle

943
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,680
to express your love.

944
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,800
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

945
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,080
We never say like that.

946
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
I hate you.

947
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,400
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

948
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,520
We cannot say.

949
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,960
To hate somebody is sinful.

950
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,352
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

951
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,960
Chastity is more in Marathi language

952
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,320
but it is a little hard

953
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,360
because it has got such as I told you

954
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,880
......idioms which can correct you just there.

955
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,000
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

956
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,440
which is very difficult.

957
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,840
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

958
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,800
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

959
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,880
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

960
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
But this is

961
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,560
short time in which I cannot tell you.

962
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,440
The way He had His own priorities.

963
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,160
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

964
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,160
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

965
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,999
Maybe,

966
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,320
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

967
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,280
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

968
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,720
No other way out.

969
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,840
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

970
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,920
May God bless you !
