1
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:10,453
Sahaja yogis should not fall to such a level

2
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:15,328
of mundane type of people after all what is going to happen to you

3
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,745
I would say those who have been worrying and all that,

4
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:22,244
should go into great meditation and understand

5
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,161
that you are insulting yourself. You are saints;

6
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,411
why should you worry about what plane you are going to get,

7
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:32,536
what you are not going to get? Shows that your level is very low;

8
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,994
definitely; all those who have worried.

9
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:41,536
You have come here under My protection,

10
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:52,244
and you will go back under My protection.

11
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:55,161
we’ll not have any pujas. You must know

12
00:03:55,161 --> 00:04:00,828
that you are all part and parcel of My being;

13
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,078
I have put you in My body and you have to behave yourself.

14
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:18,994
so in such an auspicious day when we all have come here

15
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:27,745
to do this special puja, and I would say this should be called

16
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:32,662
as a Mahalakshmi Puja because it’s something to do

17
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:36,578
with the industry of this country, and of the whole world.

18
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:46,620
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

19
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:52,453
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

20
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:56,244
That’s why we have problems now in the West.

21
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:59,370
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

22
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,286
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions

23
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:07,328
and things because they have no balance.

24
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:12,787
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

25
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:17,119
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

26
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:28,787
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

27
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:34,119
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

28
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:41,662
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

29
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:46,578
and for helping others, with a balance,

30
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,244
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

31
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,703
all this She has produced before.

32
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:59,495
She can produce for people who are sensible,

33
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:09,203
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

34
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:20,703
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

35
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:26,244
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

36
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:32,745
And that is how an industry can grow.

37
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:36,244
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

38
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:41,286
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

39
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:47,453
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

40
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:55,620
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

41
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:59,828
So a balance has to be drawn.

42
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:04,745
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

43
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:10,495
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

44
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,203
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

45
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:15,828
about which the Indians are not aware.

46
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,536
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

47
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:28,745
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

48
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:35,745
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

49
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:39,495
because otherwise who will look after them?

50
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,453
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

51
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:48,828
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

52
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:52,745
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

53
00:07:52,745 --> 00:08:02,703
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

54
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:10,203
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

55
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:17,203
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

56
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:21,620
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

57
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:27,161
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

58
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,036
They have tried something like that.

59
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:36,411
But industry should not be looked down upon

60
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:38,870
as it is looked down upon in our country.

61
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,453
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

62
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:46,703
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

63
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:49,453
It should be treated with respect,

64
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,620
and should be understood that it’s very important.

65
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:57,203
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

66
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:03,578
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

67
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,453
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

68
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,411
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

69
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:13,703
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

70
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:21,536
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

71
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:26,994
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

72
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:33,453
who are under the protection, or under the service,

73
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,286
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

74
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:40,370
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

75
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,161
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

76
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,662
to be the worst people, which is not so.

77
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:50,953
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

78
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:54,286
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

79
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,453
of very poor people how they behaved

80
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,119
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

81
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:11,119
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

82
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:16,620
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

83
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:24,620
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

84
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:31,370
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit

85
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,828
will become very important.

86
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,952
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

87
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:41,536
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

88
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:46,745
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon

89
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:53,244
for everyone. But still we are struggling

90
00:10:53,286 --> 00:11:00,161
to be on that state; many are; and still we go into materialistic tantrums

91
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:06,203
or some sort of a stupid worrying fall.

92
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:09,787
All these must be carefully watched.

93
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:16,994
If you can keep this chariot of new progress

94
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,411
progressing faster

95
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:23,662
we are going to create a new world of complete harmony,

96
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:28,870
complete peace, joy and love. But for that

97
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:35,078
you are the ones who have to do it. I cannot do it.

98
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,411
If I could have done it

99
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,328
I would not have asked you to join Sahaja Yoga.

100
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,203
It’s like the horses and the charioteer;

101
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:49,078
horses are to be driven; charioteer doesn’t drive the chariot.

102
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,536
In the same way you must understand your responsibility

103
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:56,244
that this is the greatest work we are doing.

104
00:11:56,286 --> 00:12:05,036
It’s not only the industry, or the labor and the capital,

105
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,495
I’m talking about, but I’m talking about the totality of well being.

106
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:14,662
Of course all of this is a part and parcel of that, no doubt.

107
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:18,453
But the balance should be with the totality.

108
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:23,203
So we have to think of a total well being.

109
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:27,495
Once we start thinking of the total well being then –

110
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,161
first thing that should come to us:

111
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:34,078
Are we capable of bringing up that total well being? Are we?

112
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,119
Have we got the total well being within ourselves or not? Have we?

113
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,787
We are still worried if the plane is coming or not,

114
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,952
I mean, we are so mundane, so little, so small.

115
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:54,994
With one bandhan you can control any plane, any atmosphere,

116
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:59,078
and here you are, I mean, still worried about things

117
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,994
which are absolutely under your control.

118
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:07,203
So this totality has to be thought over.

119
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,578
What is this totality that Mother is talking about?

120
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:18,787
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

121
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:32,703
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

122
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,244
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

123
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:44,161
So for that, what She does is to give  Avaida

124
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:50,912
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

125
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:53,953
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

126
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:59,994
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

127
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:03,453
because everything is mythical for you.

128
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:13,662
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

129
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:19,620
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

130
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,078
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

131
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,703
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

132
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:33,203
and panicked, because they panic others

133
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,495
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

134
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:40,952
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

135
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:45,620
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

136
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:49,703
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

137
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:53,328
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

138
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,662
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

139
00:14:57,703 --> 00:14:59,703
they are the same English who ruled us here.

140
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,328
And we were so bewitched before them and now

141
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,620
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

142
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:07,994
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

143
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:12,203
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

144
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,536
that the other person will dominate him.

145
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,328
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

146
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,536
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

147
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:25,828
out of this mythical fear.

148
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,870
The fear is created by our ego.

149
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:37,036
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

150
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,536
because he has not harmed anyone.

151
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:42,536
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

152
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,495
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

153
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:51,411
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

154
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:55,411
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

155
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,662
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

156
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:06,745
That’s what it is. So when I talk of total benevolence

157
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:12,036
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

158
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,953
So first is the fear,

159
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:17,286
which should go out of your mind completely

160
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:21,787
if you believe in the Almighty God. We’ll say,

161
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:24,495
“You are Almighty God, you are almighty this thing”

162
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,119
It's all lip-service. If you believe that God is almighty,

163
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,912
and you are connected with God,

164
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:32,787
then why should you have any fear of anything?

165
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:37,745
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

166
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,745
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

167
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:45,953
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

168
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:50,078
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

169
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:56,703
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

170
00:16:56,703 --> 00:17:03,370
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

171
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:09,703
But you think you are God. You are not.

172
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:13,745
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

173
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,620
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

174
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,161
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,

175
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:21,870
for yourself, and for everybody else.

176
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:32,453
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

177
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:37,912
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

178
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:41,536
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

179
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:47,495
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

180
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:50,453
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

181
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:54,328
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

182
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,620
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

183
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:06,244
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

184
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:10,870
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

185
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,203
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

186
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:20,328
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

187
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,370
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything

188
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:27,620
that I am telling you. Only I can tell you. Who else?

189
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:30,203
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

190
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:33,036
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.

191
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:39,994
This is another style of reaction one gets,

192
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,578
means they are not interested in their own benevolence,

193
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:45,952
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their children,

194
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:50,328
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their country or the whole world.

195
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:54,203
Now why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? Just ask one question.

196
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:58,578
Of course for you to ascend. But ascend for what?

197
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:02,370
Supposing we bring one tube light.

198
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,578
For what we have to take the tube light? But for what?

199
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,994
We have to put the light. But this tube light doesn’t give light,

200
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:13,411
nothing of the kind, so what’s the use of having this tube light?

201
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:18,119
In the same way, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga

202
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:25,203
if you cannot become the light of the Divine?

203
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:35,453
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

204
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,662
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

205
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:43,495
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

206
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,078
you are no good. All of you can come up,

207
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:50,370
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

208
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:58,078
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

209
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:03,828
Then the attention is very important.

210
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,286
The attention should be on your own perfection

211
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:14,870
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

212
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:17,453
that they start finding faults with others

213
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:21,078
instead of finding faults with themselves.

214
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,787
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

215
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:32,370
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

216
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:35,912
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

217
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:42,620
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

218
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,119
you have every right, you have every control,

219
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:53,787
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

220
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,952
is to find faults with others.

221
00:20:55,952 --> 00:21:00,370
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

222
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:06,328
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

223
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:13,286
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

224
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:17,244
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

225
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:21,703
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

226
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:24,203
They see somebody doing like this,

227
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:27,161
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

228
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,370
so what’s the harm if I do?”

229
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,620
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

230
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,578
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

231
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:42,370
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

232
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:45,870
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

233
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:48,745
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

234
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:51,745
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

235
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:54,370
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

236
00:21:54,411 --> 00:22:00,370
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

237
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,453
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

238
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:09,703
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

239
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:15,161
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

240
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,994
will get their realization to begin with, never.

241
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:24,787
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

242
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:30,119
but I never expected. But it has happened,

243
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:35,828
and even now I have to expect that all of you

244
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,703
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

245
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:46,119
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

246
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:49,286
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

247
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,119
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

248
00:22:52,161 --> 00:23:20,952
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

249
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,161
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

250
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:11,244
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

251
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:14,536
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

252
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:18,994
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

253
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:22,787
he just went and stood before him stunned.

254
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:30,994
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

255
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:35,994
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

256
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:39,703
This is the appreciation one should have,

257
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,745
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

258
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:45,703
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

259
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:51,161
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

260
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:56,745
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

261
00:34:56,787 --> 00:35:04,244
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

262
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:07,828
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

263
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,952
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

264
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:15,952
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

265
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:20,453
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

266
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:24,286
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

267
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:29,119
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

268
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:34,244
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

269
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:39,286
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

270
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:43,787
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

271
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:48,286
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

272
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:51,703
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

273
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,870
that this has come from our country;

274
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:57,286
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

275
00:35:57,328 --> 00:36:00,870
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

276
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:06,994
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

277
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:11,828
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

278
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,952
We have reached that state where we are all one.

279
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:20,411
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

280
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,244
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

281
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:32,161
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

282
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:38,328
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

283
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,953
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

284
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:49,244
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

285
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:51,787
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

286
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:55,870
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

287
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,787
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

288
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:05,953
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

289
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:08,952
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

290
00:37:08,952 --> 00:37:12,828
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

291
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:19,119
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

292
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:25,203
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

293
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:30,620
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

294
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:37,620
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

295
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:40,994
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

296
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:43,828
that this is this; nothing; we love them

297
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:49,828
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

298
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,620
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

299
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,994
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

300
00:37:56,994 --> 00:38:00,870
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

301
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:07,745
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

302
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:11,953
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

303
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:20,036
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

304
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:25,203
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

305
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:32,953
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

306
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:37,870
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

307
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:43,952
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

308
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:49,244
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

309
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,662
not only that, but he told him that,

310
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:54,411
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

311
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:57,994
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

312
00:38:57,994 --> 00:39:03,119
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

313
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:08,828
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

314
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,870
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

315
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:18,495
What can you do? So at that time,

316
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:21,662
if these saints could love each other,

317
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:27,328
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

318
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,745
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

319
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:34,787
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

320
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:39,912
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

321
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:43,453
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

322
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:48,328
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

323
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,495
and this is what we are going to know;

324
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:56,453
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

325
00:39:56,495 --> 00:40:02,078
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

326
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,870
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

327
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:14,745
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

328
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:22,495
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

329
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:26,161
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

330
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,328
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

331
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,620
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

332
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,912
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

333
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:36,578
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

334
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,994
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

335
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:42,620
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

336
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:44,787
to hang themselves for a time being.

337
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:49,078
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

338
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:58,662
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

339
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:03,286
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

340
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:08,411
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

341
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:15,578
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

342
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,119
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

343
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:27,952
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

344
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,870
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

345
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:34,328
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

346
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:37,703
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

347
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:43,453
What does it matter? Why is it so important

348
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:47,370
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

349
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:50,244
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

350
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:54,036
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

351
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,912
so why worry?

352
00:41:55,912 --> 00:42:01,703
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

353
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,244
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

354
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:06,870
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

355
00:42:06,912 --> 00:42:09,870
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

356
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,328
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

357
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:19,994
then again I forget. So you are,

358
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:23,745
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

359
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:29,620
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

360
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,411
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

361
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:38,578
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

362
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,952
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

363
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:46,453
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

364
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:49,912
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

365
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:52,036
but still they go on doing like this.

366
00:42:52,078 --> 00:42:55,328
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

367
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,787
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

368
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:03,453
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

369
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:08,078
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

370
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,161
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

371
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:18,161
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

372
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:22,328
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

373
00:43:22,328 --> 00:43:24,870
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

374
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:28,078
So it is important, it’s a drama.

375
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:35,870
The worry should be one:

376
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:43,495
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

377
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:50,703
I tell you only this universal love will give you

378
00:43:50,745 --> 00:43:55,994
that confidence and that higher status.

379
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,703
Why these saints suffered for you?

380
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:03,078
Why did Christ suffer for you?

381
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:04,703
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

382
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:07,119
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

383
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:12,078
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

384
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,203
What did they get?

385
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:21,453
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

386
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:25,912
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

387
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:28,161
whatever they have done, it’s just

388
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:32,203
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

389
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:33,912
Why not you do it?

390
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:38,952
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

391
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:42,620
to be all the time burning, then please

392
00:44:42,662 --> 00:44:46,745
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

393
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:49,495
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

394
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:52,370
May God bless you.
