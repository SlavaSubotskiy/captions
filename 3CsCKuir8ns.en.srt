1
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:11,054
It was very spontaneously decided

2
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:21,014
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

3
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:30,288
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

4
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,927
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

5
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:37,927
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

6
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,719
We have to today understand

7
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:59,535
that why do we do Devi Puja?

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,600
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

9
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:11,150
What do we get out of it?

10
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,945
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

11
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:20,259
within ourselves?

12
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:30,137
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

13
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:34,367
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,027
So when you worship Devi,

15
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:43,429
first you worship also your own Kundalini

16
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:50,594
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

17
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,128
It’s much deeper understanding

18
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:58,057
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

19
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,638
because they are not realized souls.

20
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,289
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

21
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:07,800
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,776
of getting realization

23
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,415
so that the Devi should be pleased

24
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,137
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

25
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:19,547
or must get our chance to get to somebody

26
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:23,255
who will give them realization.

27
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,744
But you are at a different level now.

28
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:32,334
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

29
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,760
and to Adi Shakti,

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,589
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

31
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:45,272
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

32
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:51,424
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

33
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:57,636
But one has to know that

34
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:06,271
only we are realized souls is not the point,

35
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,311
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

36
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:18,232
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

37
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:25,040
Then what is it? Very important –

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,001
it’s the content within us.

39
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,944
What do we have within us is the point.

40
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:37,697
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

41
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:41,679
Supposing somebody is generous,

42
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:47,160
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

43
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,600
So the content within us, we have to see.

44
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:57,924
And when we start seeing the content,

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,306
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

46
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:14,531
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

47
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:20,594
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

48
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:26,329
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

49
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:29,673
and gives rain.

50
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:37,881
But sea is the lowest level,

51
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:40,082
stands at the lowest level

52
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:44,583
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,817
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

54
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:57,329
to be really achieving more content,

55
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:07,249
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

56
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,081
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

57
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:15,232
but I think it was not explained to people.

58
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:20,506
Only the strong people can be meek,

59
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,753
secured people can be meek,

60
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:29,464
only the rich in essence can be meek,

61
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:36,091
not the people who are insecured.

62
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,831
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,648
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

64
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,794
because if they are rich they are not generous,

65
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:57,545
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

66
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:02,887
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

67
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:11,369
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

68
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:19,485
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

69
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:27,351
But when you love Me,

70
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:32,408
you have to know that there are certain qualities

71
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:36,608
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

72
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,936
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

73
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:45,936
They think they can get over everything,

74
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,416
they’re perfectly all right,

75
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:52,532
and they are thrown overboard.

76
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,295
So when we say that we have to be meek,

77
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:04,818
this is a content, the humility is a content.

78
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,070
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

79
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,470
You’ll like yourself.

80
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,774
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

81
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:24,181
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

82
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:29,560
And what is another thing we find has content

83
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:33,263
are the great mountains,

84
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:36,710
because they have heights

85
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:43,102
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

86
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,590
So such a rapport there is

87
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,175
between the humility of the ocean

88
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:55,559
and the heights of the mountain.

89
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,871
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

90
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:06,751
He is too high because so much of

91
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:15,190
content is there in that ocean,

92
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,550
then it has become beautiful

93
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:26,910
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

94
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,125
where resides the Shiva.

95
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:34,645
So it’s so joy-giving.

96
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:39,270
Of course as you have painted Me there,

97
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,550
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

98
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,110
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

99
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,070
in a very subtle manner,

100
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,310
because there’s so much of negativity

101
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:58,670
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

102
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:09,150
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

103
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,684
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

104
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,685
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

105
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,046
there is a little blessing;

106
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:26,174
goes, I would say, a long rope.

107
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,590
But that long rope one should not care for.

108
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,270
You have to care for your own quality,

109
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,990
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

110
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,598
Now look at the ocean as it is.

111
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:54,421
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

112
00:09:55,006 --> 00:10:01,215
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

113
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,758
Only possible in the ocean.

114
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:08,150
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

115
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,895
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

116
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:14,210
inexhaustible.

117
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:21,290
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

118
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:26,288
and that can go and touch the heart.

119
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:30,331
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

120
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:36,269
where there is Shiva residing.

121
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:42,033
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

122
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:47,017
and unless and until you have that largeness,

123
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:53,748
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

124
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:58,650
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

125
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,930
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

126
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,850
it never leaves.

127
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,770
If Pacific Ocean was

128
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,258
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

129
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:19,370
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

130
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,418
it has its own maryadas.

131
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:26,530
But in that maryada he has the feeling

132
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,298
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

133
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,107
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

134
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:39,334
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

135
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,890
Nature is bound by the Divine.

136
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,050
The Divine looks after the nature.

137
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,736
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

138
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:56,396
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

139
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,346
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

140
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:08,730
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

141
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,386
You are above that like a mountain.

142
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:19,747
And so wherever there is a combination

143
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:25,108
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

144
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:29,562
Deep people can only come to such shores

145
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:32,417
where there is depth.

146
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,810
That’s how you achieve your depth,

147
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,170
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

148
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,843
that beautiful area where people can come to you

149
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:50,635
and just they know this is something great,

150
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,650
everybody knows that.

151
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,930
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

152
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,784
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

153
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:11,410
But how many people come to My program?

154
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,555
How do they come to My program? Must think.

155
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:19,628
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

156
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,770
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

157
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,358
And people had no place to sit.

158
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:37,961
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

159
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,230
there are no books published, nothing.

160
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,290
So you can say that, “Mother,

161
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,152
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

162
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:57,752
I do not, but it does – I think so.

163
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:06,555
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

164
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:10,418
the collective unconscious,

165
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:16,178
the Divine will act, definitely act.

166
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,650
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

167
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,090
this that, yes people come.

168
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,410
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

169
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,250
But where there is no money involved,

170
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,938
no business involved, nothing,

171
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:40,675
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

172
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:46,377
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

173
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,730
So the Divine works it out.

174
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,305
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

175
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:03,657
then even if I am there it does not work.

176
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:08,177
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

177
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:11,875
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

178
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,681
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

179
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:19,618
a complete faith in yourself.

180
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:25,018
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

181
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,954
And what is this ocean?

182
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:33,474
It’s love, it’s love and love.

183
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,053
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

184
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:43,010
It just works spontaneously.

185
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,650
The less you do the better.

186
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,576
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

187
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:56,160
you just develop your content within yourself.

188
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,714
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

189
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,801
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

190
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:09,402
They had to go into jungles, they had to

191
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:13,417
take all the wrath of their gurus

192
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:18,173
and nobody to protect them.

193
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:24,044
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

194
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,570
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

195
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,490
whose power is all this Divine.

196
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:38,090
So you are at such an advantageous position.

197
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,075
But first you must realize.

198
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:45,130
So when we say we should have content,

199
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,490
then the vessel has to be strong

200
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:54,730
otherwise everything will break.

201
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,424
And this strength is the one you should know,

202
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,864
that you are completely protected.

203
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,299
No one can harm you.

204
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,586
They’ll try.

205
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,148
This has to be otherwise how will you test

206
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:12,530
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

207
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,936
So somebody has to try some tricks

208
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:22,036
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

209
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:24,410
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

210
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,596
everything will be cleared out.

211
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:29,194
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

212
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:33,074
how things have worked out.

213
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,850
So the strength comes.

214
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,390
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

215
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,195
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

216
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:48,898
Shraddha is not blind faith.

217
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,610
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

218
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,010
you know everything.

219
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,656
You’ve seen My photographs,

220
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:03,170
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

221
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,160
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

222
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,283
you can feel the vibrations;

223
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:15,481
you can feel others', you can cure others.

224
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,170
All this power is within you.

225
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,170
But just to realize

226
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,770
that power without ego is your strength.

227
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,170
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

228
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,506
because what is the need there?

229
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:36,330
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

230
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,074
because you want to have more, more, more.

231
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:45,806
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

232
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,162
So this power is to be ascertained first,

233
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:55,490
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

234
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,818
to find out first.

235
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:01,145
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

236
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,082
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

237
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,522
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

238
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,490
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

239
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,210
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

240
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,210
who have reached great heights and some

241
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,970
who are outside.

242
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,050
All these are negative forces

243
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,450
which were killed long time back.

244
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:42,458
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

245
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:48,468
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

246
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:52,825
but you have so many of them.

247
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,057
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

248
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,564
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

249
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:04,404
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

250
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:16,323
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

251
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:21,456
you must have complete faith in yourself.

252
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,198
If you still doubt yourself,

253
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:30,650
that’s also a human quality.

254
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,243
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

255
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:38,258
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

256
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,010
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

257
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,450
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

258
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,936
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

259
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:53,656
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

260
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:06,530
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

261
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,330
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

262
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,155
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

263
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:19,113
I am still doing like this, then how?”

264
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:22,250
Then get rid of it!

265
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,170
I mean, how can I solve your problem

266
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,650
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

267
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,770
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

268
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,170
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

269
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,370
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

270
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,641
this is what is the answer.

271
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:39,588
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

272
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:46,440
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

273
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,746
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

274
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:58,180
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

275
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:03,687
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

276
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,650
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

277
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,554
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

278
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,502
None of them!

279
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,210
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

280
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,777
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

281
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:26,367
This is the, they could have said that

282
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:30,578
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

283
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:33,370
They had enough of everything, they must have.

284
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,263
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

285
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:39,832
very big professions, very humble,

286
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:45,503
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

287
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:48,170
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

288
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,658
They wouldn’t even touch My sari like that.

289
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:54,464
The place I walk they wouldn’t touch, just imagine.

290
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:59,940
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

291
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,232
How did they recognize Me?

292
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:08,944
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

293
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,665
And they never talked about God in that country.

294
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,945
They have some stupid people who have

295
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:19,775
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

296
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:24,130
most of the people are so strong

297
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,330
and the content is showing itself.

298
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,930
Imagine every time they have a program,

299
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,690
even now on follow-on,

300
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,090
at least one thousand people are there.

301
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:43,694
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

302
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,208
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

303
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:50,330
from Siberia, this, that.

304
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,857
And they have booked themselves,

305
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,770
because there the halls you have to pay for.

306
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,050
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

307
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,240
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

308
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,306
not to work it out, take it easy,

309
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:12,090
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,010
We don’t have to kill demons.

311
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:21,450
There’s no need to join any war

312
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,010
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

313
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,130
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

314
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,015
lethargy from you, but work it out.

315
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,055
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

316
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,530
but you have to keep them awakened.

317
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,130
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

318
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,450
Not the way to meditate,

319
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,010
"All right, it’s like playing golf, it’s out."

320
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:00,290
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

321
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,218
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

322
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:11,922
With that complete understanding and dedication

323
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:17,890
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

324
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,254
It’s something very subtle and special.

325
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,426
In no action we can describe it,

326
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:35,370
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

327
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,010
To that depth no other feeling goes;

328
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:42,731
with that feeling you have to meditate.

329
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,839
And then see the results.

330
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,570
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

331
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,890
I’ve this still” –

332
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:55,730
because you are not deep enough.

333
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:02,210
It’s not how much you pray,

334
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,650
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

335
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,984
but it is how deeply you have touched

336
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:21,450
the feet of the Divine that is important.

337
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,485
So today we have to see that

338
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:34,597
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

339
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,330
so that all negativity runs away,

340
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,403
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

341
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,603
for Shiva to settle down.

342
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,690
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

343
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,050
It’s like an operation

344
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,570
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

345
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,850
you never even felt it.

346
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,970
The other day somebody gave Me a book of... [on the devilish?]

347
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,370
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

348
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,690
– it’s correct, no doubt,

349
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,730
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

350
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,370
meaning 'without percussions'.

351
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,290
But I was reading that book, I said,

352
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,250
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

353
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,570
going into ‘this means, that means'."

354
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,690
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

355
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,210
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

356
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,410
and they know it so easily.

357
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,090
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

358
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,570
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

359
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,370
has come to you so beautifully,

360
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,130
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

361
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,770
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

362
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,113
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

363
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:16,233
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

364
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,851
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

365
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,775
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

366
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:28,330
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

367
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,690
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

368
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,728
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

369
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:35,970
You see, human beings are great experts,

370
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,730
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

371
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,148
Nothing goes inside the heart.

372
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:49,415
But you have to develop that depth.

373
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,650
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

374
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,370
not through our brains.

375
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:58,182
You have to develop that heart

376
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:08,498
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

377
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:16,209
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

378
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:19,243
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

379
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:21,067
Any intelligent man can see that,

380
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,495
there’s no need to have his realization.

381
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:26,530
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

382
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,850
and he trusts. He trusts

383
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,731
himself then because he’s wise.

384
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:39,785
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

385
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,618
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

386
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:49,722
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

387
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:51,849
as you can see it clearly.

388
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:56,489
Of course, symbolically it is the same

389
00:29:56,817 --> 00:30:00,744
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

390
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:05,744
The first work is to destroy the negativity

391
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,193
which is going on as you know.

392
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:11,489
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

393
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:15,295
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

394
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:19,135
But you are the lights.

395
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,610
You have to put the lights on

396
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:26,258
and you have to look after your light,

397
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:32,098
and you have to make that light eternal.

398
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:39,928
This is one work which you are doing.

399
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,370
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

400
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,970
is to spread light, enlighten people.

401
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,770
The negativity that is around you

402
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,730
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

403
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,663
Today it has become subtler.

404
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:04,490
The negativity has become subtler.

405
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,898
It’s entered into your being,

406
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:12,017
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

407
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:18,136
Even one step

408
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,035
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

409
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:23,715
you can go down.

410
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:27,875
So one has to be alert, without tension.

411
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:31,360
You have to be alert without tension.

412
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,090
And the alertness grows.

413
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,642
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

414
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,177
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

415
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:46,503
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

416
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:51,289
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

417
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:53,090
And immediately you take to it.

418
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,930
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

419
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,330
immediately you clean it.

420
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:11,955
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

421
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:14,905
'daksha' is the word for that.

422
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:19,011
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

423
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,490
Goddess used to give enlightenment

424
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,259
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

425
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,459
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

426
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,810
They are praying, they are doing puja,

427
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,619
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

428
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:38,607
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

429
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,026
from all negativity coming,

430
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:44,319
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

431
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:50,582
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

432
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,576
So you have to kill your negativity,

433
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:59,518
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

434
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,858
No negativity can touch you.

435
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:10,417
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

436
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:16,937
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

437
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,610
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

438
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,970
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

439
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,473
By that nobody is going to gain.

440
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:34,523
At the collective level it just works automatically.

441
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:36,294
You don’t have to worry.

442
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:40,690
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

443
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,850
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

444
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,730
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

445
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,250
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

446
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,150
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

447
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:02,051
Now another quality that you have:

448
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,610
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

449
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,690
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

450
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,370
it’s penetrated into you

451
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:18,930
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

452
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:26,412
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

453
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:29,890
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

454
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,418
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

455
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:38,890
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

456
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,450
you get the cool from there.

457
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,450
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

458
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,930
you give bliss to others.

459
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,570
But there is no bliss within yourself,

460
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,521
but what bliss you can give to others?

461
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:53,905
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

462
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:56,105
You see She has very extreme characters,

463
00:34:56,271 --> 00:35:00,706
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

464
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,610
She can be very cruel,

465
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,905
and She can be extremely gentle

466
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:10,892
– like two ragas of yesterday.

467
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:25,607
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

468
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:29,538
beyond all human expectations,

469
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:36,098
and She could be extremely mild.

470
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:46,130
So this harsh part you need not have.

471
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,370
It will just work.

472
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,090
This part is only kept for the Divine.

473
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,928
You just take to the other side.

474
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:58,690
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

475
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,770
After all, Divine also must do some work.

476
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:08,130
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

477
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:12,064
So the Divine will look after that part.

478
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:17,400
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

479
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,135
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

480
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:24,473
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

481
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:27,314
their love – everything She enjoys.

482
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:30,751
In the same way you have to enjoy.

483
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,570
You have to know about everything,

484
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,636
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

485
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:46,390
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

486
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,270
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

487
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,878
At the most!

488
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:56,750
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

489
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,030
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

490
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,702
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

491
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,390
And you are on the stage,

492
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,710
so they are looking out what to focus light,

493
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,470
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

494
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,870
what is to be changed around.

495
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,815
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

496
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:19,255
So you need not do all that work.

497
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:24,574
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

498
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:29,351
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

499
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:36,551
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

500
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,757
So to leave certain things into the hands

501
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:46,099
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

502
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,694
And that much of this, if done, then

503
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,860
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

504
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,710
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

505
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:06,166
We never expected how things we got it done?”

506
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,686
There’s a very, very big force working:

507
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:12,310
the Force, the Energy

508
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,527
which is the Source of all the energies,

509
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:18,624
which has created this great universe,

510
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:22,064
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

511
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:26,120
which has created you very delicately.

512
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,920
This Force is working.

513
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,480
And that Force is looking after you,

514
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,159
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

515
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:45,751
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

516
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:50,251
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

517
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,640
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

518
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,400
give us Your lion so we fight.”

519
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,790
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

520
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,774
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

521
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,303
these horrible conditionings we have.

522
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:10,526
You have to get rid of it.

523
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:14,863
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

524
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:18,440
lots of things, you see. If you see,

525
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,686
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

526
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,494
but they are there.

527
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:31,406
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

528
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,197
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

529
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:40,477
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

530
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,143
– like a Goddess. Why not?

531
00:39:44,303 --> 00:39:49,760
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

532
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:53,120
So you have all the heritage available to you.

533
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,159
But you have to be worthy,

534
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:01,877
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

535
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:05,490
You have to just know that you are worthy

536
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,130
and that you can do it.

537
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:14,492
So again today we are here to do this puja,

538
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,163
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

539
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:24,715
and is luck for you to have this puja.

540
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:30,426
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

541
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:34,609
very subtler nature.

542
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:39,930
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

543
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,373
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

544
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,810
because it’s blood.

545
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,969
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

546
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:56,083
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

547
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:59,178
another side it is the security.

548
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:03,698
So for you it is the security around you.

549
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:09,733
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

550
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,046
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

551
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,482
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

552
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,111
so beautifully you are settled down.

553
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,984
May God bless you.
