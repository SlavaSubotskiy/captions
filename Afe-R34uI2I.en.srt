1
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,330
I bow to all the seekers of truth. You have
just now heard that within us lies the power

2
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,670
of our ascent, ascent to the Divine. Now maybe
there are some people who can say "How? How

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,790
do You say that? What's Your authority?"

4
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,790
Naturally, one can ask such a question. But
as a scientist we have to keep our minds open

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,530
to any knowledge. I say this is the knowledge
of the roots. Why? Whatever we have known

6
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,030
so far is the knowledge of the tree. It sounds
fantastic sometimes to people how can the

7
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,180
awakening of the Kundalini or the Holy Ghost
as described in the Bible can bring forth

8
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,870
this tremendous change; this transformation
and all the benefits of physical, mental,

9
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,570
emotional and material being within us. It's
impossible to believe because it's too fantastic.

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,720
But we don't realize that how fantastically
we are made by God Almighty.

11
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,720
We take Him so much for granted. When we make
a computer in this world we feel we have done

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,150
a great job. But do you know you yourself
you are a computer which knows without thinking.

13
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:33,060
I see you and I know I see you. I don't have
to go back to some sort of a programming to

14
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,060
find out what am I seeing; is also spontaneous
and living. All the living things are created

15
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,200
by the living God and then we know that we
have come to this stage of human awareness;

16
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,420
from here if we have to ascend, there must
be some method, mechanism within us.

17
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Now some may say that why should we seek.
There's no why about it. Because you see the

18
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,459
confusion all along, you see what's happening
to people. There are so many thought waves

19
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:22,030
coming up like 'we must look after our health',
'we must look after our mind'. There are so

20
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,030
many sorts of theologies and also many intellectual
expositions and manifestations; that one gets

21
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:40,349
absolutely confounded and can't understand
where are we. Naturally in this confusion

22
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,680
one feels very frustrated and wants to find
out what are we here for? Any intelligent

23
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,590
sincere person, honest person thinks that
way. 'Why am I here?' Of course for the frivolous,

24
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,590
they can manage for some time. They can continue
for one or two lives till they become little

25
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:17,110
bit concerned but normally any intelligent
person would think that I have been made a

26
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:26,859
human being for what? What is the purpose
of my being a human being from the animal

27
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:36,129
stage? Then people say that you are a human
being now you forget about your creator; you

28
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:43,860
forget about anything like that and you think
you are the creator. You just believe that

29
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,860
you are the one who has to rule the whole
world. That's how we create a barrier between

30
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:58,939
ourselves and the truth. The truth exists
and God exists whether we believe in it or

31
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:08,349
not. Actually blind faith is not going to
take us to God. The faith has to be based

32
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,819
on experience which is called as 'shraddha'.
It has to be based on experience of the truth.

33
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,819
Supposing, I have not been to this room; I
have not seen it; I don't know what it is

34
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:26,469
and I started describing it and if you believe
Me, then I would say it's just a brain wash

35
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:33,469
and it has been nothing but a talk and talk
and talk about God throughout. The reason

36
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:41,849
was the human beings were not ready at that
time I should say to get to their Realization.

37
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:50,879
We had few people very few in the last say
sixth to the modern times.

38
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:05,259
I asked a Zen master, "How many realized souls
you had? 'Kashyapas'"

39
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:12,080
And he said, "We had altogether only twenty
four 'Kashyapas' from the sixth Century to

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,099
the thirteenth Century and we had none."

41
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,960
So I said, "Then what are you doing there?
You are a Zen Master and you are not a realized

42
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,219
soul."

43
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,210
So he said, "I am doing my job."

44
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:29,210
A priest, I must say John Clover is also a
priest; and a priest very well known personality

45
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,039
and I asked him, "What do you mean by Holy
Ghost?"

46
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,159
So he says, "I am agnostic."

47
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,849
I said, "Then, what are you doing in the church?"

48
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:51,839
So he says "I am doing my job."

49
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,839
I was surprised! What sort of a job you can
do when you do not know what you are talking?

50
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,599
You are professing something about which you
yourself are not sure. You yourself you are

51
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,599
not a free soul and you are talking about
freedom of the soul; is something like a advertising

52
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,860
department.

53
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,860
So people start wondering, is there anything
like God? And no wonder that so many have

54
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,479
discarded as nothing. But the time has come
now to prove the existence of God. The time

55
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,490
has now come to prove all the miracles of
the scriptures. At this time only there's

56
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,899
a controversy should come up that there were
no miracles and the time has come to prove

57
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:52,899
that. Isn't it surprising that spontaneously
at this time only all these intellectuals

58
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,740
are coming out with their novel ideas? And
that this is the time we can prove it that

59
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,759
there is God. We can prove it that there is
Kundalini, the Holy Ghost and we can prove

60
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:17,209
it that there is Spirit and that a human being
can ascend. I think the background is so dark

61
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,819
that the light will show better and that has
to happen. In these modern times, I find if

62
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,440
you talk to anybody about God, they will laugh
at you. Is not regarded fashionable to talk

63
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,070
about God but despite of all that in the modern
times we have the maximum numbers of seekers.

64
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,120
We never had so many seekers at any time.

65
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Think of Christ, he had those twelve disciples
who did not believe in Him till they saw His

66
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,280
resurrection. I mean they did not believe
in Him fully, I mean to say. Look at Buddha

67
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,280
or look at anyone of these people. Mohammad
Saab, how they tortured his life? And they

68
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,600
all have talked about this time as the resurrection
time because before the doomsday the resurrection

69
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,880
has to come. But the people who are in-charge
of the, there are people who have taken their

70
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,180
charge in this world. Will not believe that
there can be redemption, that there could

71
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,830
be resurrection because it's a money making
proposition.

72
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,830
I met a Mayor today in the morning of another
place and he told Me, he asked Me actually

73
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,150
"Why people become so fanatic about religion?"

74
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,150
I said, "Because it is a money making proposition
everywhere".

75
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,570
Any money making proposition has to be fanatic
because you have to be successful money wise

76
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:34,570
and also compromising. It's an enterprise
and God doesn't understand money, that's the

77
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:42,650
worst part of it. He doesn't know what money
is. He does all that is living what human

78
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:54,510
beings do is nothing but they convert dead
to another dead. Now for example some tree

79
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:04,130
is dead, we make a bench out of it; from dead
to dead. But can we transform these flowers

80
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,840
into fruits? We do not. And the one who does
billions and billions of these at the time,

81
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,090
at the right time, proper seasons, who must
be that? Whatever we have done so far is the

82
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,690
dead work. But the work of God is the living
work and the living work of God is evident

83
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,670
in our own existence that we have become human
beings from amoeba stage and that if higher

84
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,660
ascent has to take place it has to take place
through some spontaneous happening meaning

85
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,280
living happening not by some artificial things
like in the Hindu religion we have a ceremony

86
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,530
called as 'munja' where the, at eight years
of age they say the child has now become a

87
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:24,050
Brahmin, means he has known the all pervading
power of Brahma, of Holy Ghost, certified.

88
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,880
As we have in Christian religion also in the
churches they'll put their hand and your head

89
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,880
and say now you have become Christian, Baptized.
How Sir? Just an exercise and we believe in

90
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,370
it. We accept the situation and we believe
that we are that. Mohammad Saab has said,

91
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,470
"You have to become the Pir."

92
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:02,470
There's no religion which has not said that
human awareness is for just balancing yourself.

93
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,370
That's the religion is. It's like trial and
error and trial and error; that you make mistakes

94
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,190
improve yourself, make mistakes improve yourself.
You move from one extreme to another as you

95
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,530
see here to the left or to the right and then
you come to the center and the central path

96
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:28,530
of ascent is within us and which we achieve
through our moderation and not through our

97
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,790
extremes and those who go to extremes and
become fanatic are people who are not religious

98
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:48,990
by any chance because religion must give you
a balance. That's the first thing one must

99
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:58,460
attain, attain through religion. Now within
us lies the power of our ascent and the path

100
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,900
of our ascent and on this path we have got
different centers which represent something

101
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,980
very subtle within us. As I told you this
is the knowledge of the roots.

102
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,650
Supposing a tree is sick we see the leaves
are falling. So we take one leaf. First of

103
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,650
all once if we pluck it out it is already
finished. But even on the tree we try to inject

104
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,360
something to the leaf, does it reach the whole
of the tree? It does not. If you have to cure

105
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:50,490
that tree, you have to go to the roots. In
the same way within ourselves these centers

106
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,610
are placed and the root has to be awakened
so that it passes through all these centers,

107
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:07,630
enlightens all these centers and give you
the ultimate that we call as the true Baptism

108
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:15,260
or Self Realization or in Sanskrit knowledge
they say 'Atma Sakshathkar'.

109
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:24,029
Now where does the Spirit reside? The Spirit
resides in our heart. Now this is a hypothesis

110
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,430
for you. You need not accept. But keep your
mind open for it. But the seat of God almighty

111
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:38,820
is on top of your head though the reflection
of that as the Spirit is in the heart. When

112
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,820
this Kundalini which is called as the Root
also or is called as the Holy Ghost, which

113
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,640
is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, which
is the power of God, which is the Primodial

114
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Mother, which is your individual Mother rises
and when it touches that point the Spirit

115
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:12,050
in your heart starts emitting these cool vibrations.
First you feel it here coming out of your

116
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,440
head, the Cool Breeze. This happens. This
is not artificial you can even see in many

117
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,440
people the pulsation of the Kundalini very
clearly just like a heart or in that bone,

118
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:36,460
which is just a bone; pulsates like a heart,
when there is an obstruction in the higher

119
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,589
centers.

120
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:47,589
Now the subtle side of these centers are that
the first center is related to our innocence.

121
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Have we bothered to find out how are we innocent
in our childhood? What is that creates innocence

122
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,880
within us? Then the second center that we
have is the center of Swadishthana which deals

123
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:22,049
with the creativity that we have. Now God
has made human beings in his image. He has

124
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:31,299
the same centers within Him which He reflects
within us. So with this center He has created

125
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,730
all this universe. This is for the creativity.

126
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:43,730
The third center within us, which is the naval
center, which looks after the solar plexus

127
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:52,169
on the gross, is called as the Nabhi Chakra
meaning the naval center and is responsible

128
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:59,879
for giving us the seeking. We should know
why do we seek. Why do we seek food to begin

129
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:09,889
with? We feel hungry, but how do we know that
we are hungry and that we want food? Even

130
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:17,100
a child knows that, even an animal knows that;
how? This is the center tells us that now

131
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,110
you are hungry better go and have some food.
And this is the center tells us now you better

132
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:33,110
seek some money, maybe some power, maybe all
the human things that we seek and waste our

133
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:41,779
life quite a lot in that. After that when
you are affluent when you have solved all

134
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,700
these mundane things like no more we are living
in the jungles like animals. Then we start

135
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,909
thinking that there must be something beyond
because I have got everything now but I haven't

136
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:01,909
got joy. I don't feel joyous. I am not satisfied,
what is that? When this seeking starts then

137
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:12,539
you are a special category of seekers for
which William Blake has clearly written very,

138
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:20,009
very clearly two hundred years back he said
that men of God will become prophets and they

139
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,970
will have powers to make others prophets and
that is today's Sahaja Yoga. This seeking

140
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,710
is a special category of people who we find
now a days all over the world. That's why

141
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I said it at the very outset that you do not
find so many seekers, in the history of spirituality

142
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:53,649
so many seekers. But today there are thousands
and thousands; I would say millions and millions

143
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:02,070
of seekers. But what happens to them? Again
they get lost. Some start getting lost in

144
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:15,869
the intellectual understanding of God, finished.
How can you understand God with this limited

145
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:22,869
brain? He's unlimited. You have to go beyond
this mind to understand. What can we understand

146
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:34,419
of that God who does all these marvelous things
of living processes which we cannot do even

147
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,480
a wee bit with this brain of ours? So some
are lost in the books and some are lost in

148
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,529
the organized religions, finished.

149
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:58,529
Sunday morning have a nice dress, go to the
church, I have done my work as far as God

150
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:05,340
is concerned. Or I would say for a Hindu is
to go to the temple, take some money give

151
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:12,340
it to the Brahmin there, done. So they are
also lost in it. Then there are lots of markets

152
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,480
now a days. We have 'spiritualists' and we
have 'charismatics' and we have got 'seventh

153
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,080
day adventist' and 'born again'; all sorts.
They are only same people with different brands.

154
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:45,590
There's no difference between one human being
and another, even if you put any brand on

155
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:52,590
our head we are just the same. There is no
difference at all. They may profess something,

156
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
but whatever you profess is not within you.
So it is not what you profess is important,

157
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:13,769
but what you become. Becoming is the point.
What you become on your central nervous system.

158
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:26,429
That is the evolutionary impact. When we evolve
from animal to human state it is expressed

159
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:35,200
on our central nervous system. For example
if you have to take a dog through a dirty

160
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,200
lane, he has no objection, he just walks through.
But we cannot go. Now you bring a dog here

161
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,909
in a good garden, he's quite happy, he doesn't
know whether it is a beautiful garden of flowers

162
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:55,909
or it's a dirty lane. But for a human being
this awareness is there and he can feel it.

163
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:03,309
Now to human beings if you talk of sin this
that, they don't understand. They'll say,

164
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:08,700
"What's wrong? What's wrong?" "If I kill somebody
what's wrong?" "If I do like this what's wrong?"

165
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Because the awareness is at that level. But
Christ, would He do such a thing? Buddha,

166
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:24,499
would He do such a thing? Khalil Gibran, would
he do such a thing? William Blake? No, why?

167
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:35,419
Because they are above us and their sense
and sensitivity has developed in such a manner

168
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,450
that they are the people who know what is
right and what is wrong.

169
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:48,450
So we live in a relative world. We must accept
this. We have no sense of absolute and even

170
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:54,429
if we have it is told to us from our fathers,
forefathers or in the church or in the temple

171
00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:01,429
somewhere; is all conditioning. We do not
know for definite whether it is right or wrong

172
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:12,460
because we haven't got that awareness. So
what has to happen to you is that you have

173
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,600
to become collectively conscious that means
you can feel your own centers on your finger

174
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:28,350
tips. That is Self-Realization, you know your
Self and you should feel the centers of other

175
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,559
people on your finger tips and so that you
know what is wrong with another person or

176
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,789
what is wrong with you. But you are so much
separated from yourself like it becomes your

177
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:51,789
cloth, the whole body, the ego, the superego
that you know it is wrong and you clear it

178
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,029
out, if you know the technique. This is the
another meaning of the word Yoga.

179
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:05,029
The first meaning is that Yoga is the union
with the Divine; also Yoga means to be deft

180
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,320
in the art of God's love, in the technique
of Divine laws; this is the another meaning.

181
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Yoga doesn't mean standing on your head. That's
just a misnomer, because some people have

182
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:34,509
got very little knowledge about things and
they start saying this is Yoga. But I mean

183
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:42,499
Patanjali who has talked about it thousands
of years back has described nothing but Sahaja

184
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:49,499
Yoga; is the spontaneous union, spontaneous
union with the Divine. That's what he has

185
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:58,749
described out and out but who reads that big
book. Yoga you can buy in three pages you

186
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:06,070
see. Stand on your head; bend your feet, but
why? We too have to do some exercises in Sahaja

187
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:16,759
Yoga but the Kundalini has to rise and tell
us where it is obstructed accordingly we do

188
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:23,869
the exercise. Supposing you have a trouble
on your head and you do the stomach exercises,

189
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:29,279
the stomach will be spoilt for nothing at
all. As it is you have a headache plus the

190
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:36,279
stomach is also spoilt. So it is a big science
one has to understand. But it is so simple

191
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:43,340
as a child. Now this child is a realized soul
he knows because you become the absolute.

192
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:53,850
Now if you want to know whether there is God
or not you just put your hands like this and

193
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:01,590
ask the question, "Mother is there God?" When
you ask the question you'll get tremendous

194
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,639
Cool Breeze flowing.

195
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:10,639
Is like a computer, an absolute computer.
Now you ask a question, "Was Christ the son

196
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:17,919
of God?" You get tremendous; but ask about
Rasputin "Was he a saint?" I don't want to

197
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,220
ask because it might burn My hand. That's
how you know the absolute. Afterwards you

198
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:39,710
don't need also to use the hands, just without
that you know and that is what the state one

199
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:47,330
has to achieve, that is the final break-through
we have to achieve because this modern times

200
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:56,999
as they say, these are the times that are
described as the resurrection time, the judgment

201
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:05,210
time and this is the time that people have
to judge themselves. Your own Spirit will

202
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:14,659
judge you. Nobody is going to put you on a
weighing machine to see what have you got.

203
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:22,059
Your own centers will be judged by you yourself.
You become your own master, your own Guru

204
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:28,299
and you judge yourself and correct it. You
judge others and correct it. But you don't

205
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:35,299
tell them, you speak in a strange language
as the disciples of Christ spoke. You talk

206
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,989
in the language of centers. Like you ask somebody,
"What's the matter with this person?" So he'll

207
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:47,989
say, "His left Vishuddhi is catching." Means
he feels guilty. If you feel guilty your left

208
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:51,100
Vishuddhi catches.

209
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:58,100
We went to Nottingham today and there was
a taxi fellow who came in. We sat in the car

210
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,159
and I knew he was a realized soul. And he
started talking to Me. He also took to Me

211
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:16,159
easily and he confessed to Me, "Mother I am
a healer." I knew he was a, everybody knew

212
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,669
that he was a realized soul. He did not know
much about it because he's not a Sahaja Yogi

213
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:28,789
to know all the deftness of it. But he knew
that he was something different and a very

214
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:33,100
gentle and a sweet personality he had.

215
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,269
And while talking I asked him, "What's the
matter with you? Why do you feel so guilty?"

216
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,859
He said, "I don't know but I feel like a criminal."

217
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:41,529
I said, "Why?"

218
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,929
"Because everybody thinks I am queer."

219
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:50,929
I said, "In a lunatic asylum if a saint man
goes everybody thinks that he is insane. So

220
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:56,720
you must not feel that way, you should have
all full confidence in yourself."

221
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,350
But he was so surprised that I could tell
all these things about him. I said, "Anybody

222
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:07,049
would say because we know what you feel on
your finger tips. It's nothing great that

223
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,029
we are doing."

224
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:13,289
Because supposing, dog cannot talk to us,
but supposing we tell the dog that this is

225
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:20,289
music, Indian music. He will ask, "How do
you know it is Indian music?"

226
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,940
Because we know, we can hear. You can't hear;
you cannot differentiate. But we don't take

227
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,509
such pride in saying that we know this color
or we know that thing and we know what is

228
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:39,039
art, what is not. We think it is our own right
to know and we know it. In the same way once

229
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:46,039
you get your Realization you just know it
because you become. So becoming is the main

230
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:53,279
thing that you become a realized soul, a saint,
a sage, a seer, but as a result of this awakening

231
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,999
because it passes through various centers,
into various layers. First thing that happens

232
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:10,999
to you; first thing I must say that you get
your physical body cured. That's how Sahaja

233
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:20,950
Yoga cures cancer. What is so great about
it? It does and it's only this Sahaja Yoga

234
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:27,619
that is going to cure cancer. Otherwise you'll
take chemotherapy, loose your hair, then they'll

235
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:34,619
cut your throat and cut your nose and you'll
end up by parts, you see and when one will

236
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,700
die it won't be in one piece. But in Sahaja
Yoga the Kundalini rises and she supplies

237
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,320
the necessary vital forces to all these centers
and you get cured. Practically everything

238
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:58,249
that is to be repaired can be repaired if
the stage is not very much advanced. If the

239
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:06,169
stage is very much advanced then the Divine
takes a decision that let this body die and

240
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:13,419
come back again in a fresher way. Then it
allows it to die. But mostly if it is in a

241
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:23,710
repairing stage without taking any medicine,
without going to any doctor, without anything

242
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:30,710
you can cure yourself. It's not difficult.
It transforms your personality in the sense

243
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:40,179
that your priorities change completely. I
don't have to tell you 'don't do this'. That

244
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:47,109
I will not say because then half of you may
run away. But it will happen in such a manner

245
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:54,109
that you yourself won't do that. I don't have
to tell you at all. Because firstly if you

246
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,840
try to do it you will lose your vibrations
you feel unhappy. You'll lose your joy and

247
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:12,619
peace and maybe your body may react and that
it may vomit out the thing or it may make

248
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:25,849
you very painful so that you just don't do
it. You become righteousness, you become virtuous

249
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:30,210
and you enjoy your virtues. You don't force
your virtues on others you just say that one

250
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:37,210
day he should get Realization. The concern
is as if a part of your body is sick and you

251
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:48,220
want to soothe it and put it right. No obligation,
nothing. If somebody is drowning himself actually

252
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:55,489
part of you is getting drowned that's why
you jump into it. But here actually you feel

253
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,700
the another person and if you know how to
cure that then there's no obligation at all

254
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,919
because there is a part and parcel of your
being. Supposing this finger is paining and

255
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,919
if I rub it. Am I obliging myself? But it
is so spontaneous it is so automatic that

256
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:22,530
the idea also doesn't come into your head
that you have obliged him. It's so simple.

257
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:28,570
This is the power of God's love. We have never
used that before because we were not capable

258
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,520
of doing that. All these wars and all these
problems of the world are because we are using

259
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,520
the power of hatred. We talk of peace but
how will you make peace on this earth when

260
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,770
the people are so disturbed?

261
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:51,770
The source of peace is the Spirit and if the
whole world or a part of it and a very wee

262
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:01,590
part of it accepts that they should have their
Spirit manifesting and they establish themselves

263
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,630
you'll see all these problems will vanish
into thin air. As it is in your private life

264
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:13,630
they vanish out. Everything becomes smooth
joyous happy. The relationships become very

265
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:23,220
pure and you really enjoy human beings for
the first time. Otherwise it is just we'll

266
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,630
say "Oh we are brothers, brothers, brothers.
We are sisters, we are this that." When it

267
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:41,630
comes to selfishness everything drops out
because it's just a mental projection. Even

268
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,500
countries will say we are all friends, we
are going to help, but when it comes to something

269
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,630
important they drop out. But this is no mental
projection, is reality. Become that and that

270
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:58,630
should happen to many, many people by that
a kind of a catalysism will take place and

271
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,970
the whole world has to be changed as promised.
Those days are ahead, is working out very

272
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,780
well, I have worked in this England for ten
years. In India hardly two years, but thousands

273
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:29,470
and thousands in the villages are now Sahaja
Yogis. They have given up all their bad habits.

274
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:36,470
They have become masters of themselves. Even
I would say in England we have quite a lot

275
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:43,520
of Sahaja Yogis, but still is a very important
place is England because it plays a very important

276
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,560
role in spirituality because it is the heart
of the universe and the heart has to pump

277
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:57,320
out the truth. It's pumping out all kind of
nonsense on the television.

278
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Today on the television they gave Me hardly
thirty seconds first and then three minutes.

279
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:11,820
What do I do in three minutes, but for a joker
or a clown or for absolutely useless person

280
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,200
there will be hours together. This is the
problem that we have to face, but I am sure

281
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:32,450
when the chaos will be seen clearly people
will ask for the answer and when they seek

282
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:41,060
that they will receive what they are seeking.
That is a promise and the promise has to be

283
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,240
fulfilled. All that is promised in the scriptures
has to be fulfilled.

284
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,060
May God bless you all.

285
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Now if you have any problems please ask me.
Today I had a very, very hectic day. The whole

286
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:10,420
day I have been moving from places to places
and somehow you have been so kind to come

287
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:20,730
here and I am sure we'll get the experience
tonight. But in any case if you have any questions

288
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:29,020
please ask. Is important.

289
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:37,310
From the seekers: May I ask a question Mataji?

290
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,620
Mother: Yes please.

291
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:54,200
From the seekers: Is it possible to awaken
Kundalini without a spring guidance like You

292
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,400
because You are not available to us so only
by reading books?

293
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,210
Mother: Yes it is possible. Only

294
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,290
Sahaja Yogi: 'Only by reading books' she said

295
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,590
Mother: By reading books. No, no, no not at
all. Kabir Das has said "Padhi, padhi pandita

296
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,700
murakha bhayei". That by reading too much
even the learned have become stupid.

297
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:11,480
Seeker: So how could we have Divine guidance
like You?

298
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,470
Mother: What you have to do first of all is
to know that it's a living process and for

299
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:24,470
any living process you don't need mental understanding.
Just I have talked to you because after all

300
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:33,150
you are very intelligent people. But supposing
we want to sprout a seed what do we do? We

301
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:41,220
put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts.
Do we give it a lecture before hand? All right

302
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,320
do we do anything? It is built-in in the seed
as well as in the Mother Earth the capacity

303
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,760
to do it. So of course you have to have somebody
who has the capacity. Satguru is the real

304
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:07,020
Guru. But these days they are all in the market;
all making money. First thing is no money

305
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,240
can be paid for sprouting of the seed; first
principle. Ninety nine point nine percent

306
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:19,240
[99.9%] will drop out on that point and is
said that 'Sahib Milaye'. The one who makes

307
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:31,150
you meet the Divine is the Guru. The one who
talks and gives lecture is not the Guru. But

308
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,280
these days there are some very great Gurus
but they are hiding themselves in the Himalayas

309
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,760
and I sent one of them with great request
to America that please go and do some work

310
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,940
in America I won't be able to go. He stayed
in New York for three days and ran back into

311
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:54,860
Himalayas. He said, "The people are at a very
lower level you see, they just talk of dollar."

312
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:01,860
He ran away. So they don't want to deal just
now perhaps maybe after sometime if they see

313
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,990
that the area is all right, they may come
down. But there are many great saints all

314
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:14,990
over the world. But sort of they have receded
themselves. First you all become saints and

315
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,980
they will all come to join.

316
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,900
Seeker: To become saint is very difficult.

317
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,570
Mother: Who told you that?

318
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:33,820
Seeker: Afreed

319
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,910
Mother: It is the easiest thing. Living process
is the easiest. But we are so difficult we

320
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,490
don't want to eat like this we want to go
round and eat, then say...It is the simplest

321
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:49,490
thing. 'Sahaja Samadhi Lago', Sahaja you get
it. Is said by everyone who said it is difficult?

322
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Who has said it tell me? No one. 'Ek hi akshar
premaka pade so pandita ho'.

323
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:11,250
Who has said it? Did Christ say so? Did Buddha
say so? Nobody said. But they could not do

324
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,250
it because people were difficult. So they
said all right go ahead, carry on. Krishna

325
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:35,390
at the very outset of Gita he said that you
find yourself. You become a 'sthita pragya'.

326
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,000
You become a realized soul, at the very outset.

327
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,830
But Arjuna says, "But how You are telling
me to go on war and here You are telling me

328
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,650
to become 'saakshi', the witness?"

329
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:55,650
Krishna was a Father. He said, 'This gentleman
won't understand in a straight way.' Because

330
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:03,580
Krishna is a special incarnation of diplomacy,
he understand how human beings are, like a

331
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,290
Father you see. He won't tell straight forward.
He will say 'all right you want to do it go

332
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:15,290
ahead.' You want to jump in the sea go ahead.
So He said, "All right," it's very interesting

333
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:23,330
we don't understand Gita also without Realization.
Like a father who comes out of his house and

334
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,890
sees his son trying to drive the cart.

335
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:32,750
So he says, "All right you want to drive the
cart please put the horse before the cart."

336
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:38,740
But the son says, "No I can put the horse
behind and drive the cart."

337
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,210
He said, "All right do it no harm. Only put
your attention there."

338
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,190
So he says that, "All right you do all your
work, but put it at the Lotus Feet of the

339
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,440
God."

340
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,400
You cannot do it, is an absurd condition.
You cannot do it; absurd condition. But when

341
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,310
you get your Realization you don't say "I
do it". You say, "It's going", "it's coming",

342
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:09,220
"it's working", "it's happening". You become
a third person; 'akarm'. The second he said

343
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,220
about 'bhakti' is the devotion. He said 'pushpam;
all the flowers and fruits and all these you

344
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:23,910
give Me, I take them' but where did He play?
On the word 'ananya' means you have to do

345
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,700
the devotion when you are not the other 'ananya'.
Now when are you like that? When you are one

346
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:41,890
within and also is logical that unless and
until you are connected within what sort of

347
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,550
a bhakti [devotion] you are doing here? You
must be connected. Only 'bhakti' you can do

348
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:54,230
is to say that "Connect me". But otherwise
if you are not connected, if the telephone

349
00:44:54,230 --> 00:45:01,230
is not connected what are you telephoning?
Is as simple as that, is very logical. So

350
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:10,470
the whole 'Karma Yoga' and 'Bhakti Yoga' is
nothing but that you get your Self-Realization

351
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,480
first. Now this is the problem with human
beings that they want to live on words, but

352
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:33,180
how long? Nothing is difficult. So far I have
not seen it is a difficult thing to do. It

353
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,200
has worked out.

354
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,860
Any other question please?

355
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:45,860
[From the audience someone asks a question
related to astrology, the question is not

356
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,160
audible]

357
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Mother: Is of no consequence.

358
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:17,420
Seeker: Is of no consequence?

359
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,660
Mother: No consequence
This is very subtle, above everything else,

360
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:27,660
makes no difference. But later on I find because
we are problematic people and the Kundalini

361
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:36,930
comes down to help you in different places.
And I find that sometimes the people how they

362
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:44,640
are made at their birth by astrology behave
in different manners. But still the sign and

363
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:55,300
all these things that are so gross do not
bind you. You just throw them away and get

364
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:05,690
out of it. So it's nothing important. You
go beyond all stars, beyond all science and

365
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:19,870
things. It is of help in a way; for example
they cast My horoscope in India and they discovered

366
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:38,870
something about Me and which is something
very fantastic I should say. It has something.

367
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:44,630
For example: discovering this, you may think
'what is it discovering this?' 'What was the

368
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:51,040
use of the Kundalini has nothing to do it?'
But today only on the radio I could give Realization

369
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:58,040
to many people. On the television you can
give Realization to people. So this is also

370
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
useful. Everything is achieved for Self-Realization.
Science has achieved everything for Self-Realization.

371
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:17,830
It is at the service of God and whatever is
not is all destructive. Even I would say atom

372
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:28,030
bomb is important otherwise people would never
have thought of God.

373
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:38,100
Seeker: Yes; On to religion, Catholics why
is it that they make such a do of the Pope?

374
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:53,500
He's only flesh and blood.

375
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,650
Mother: What do they do?

376
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,340
Sahaja Yogi: Why do Christians and Catholicism
particularly make such a thing of the Pope?

377
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,700
He's only flesh and blood.

378
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Mother: You better go and ask them. About
this Pope John, I went with My Husband to

379
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:15,880
Cranko and being a VIP or something, they
asked Me, "What would You like to see?"

380
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,680
I said, "I would like to see some good Church."

381
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,680
So they took Me to Cranko where this fellow
was the Cardinal and they held some sort of

382
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:31,650
a mass. I was sitting there and then I shook
hands with him and had tea with him and I

383
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:38,650
rose his Kundalini. It came and went back
in the same shot. But sometimes when he is

384
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,140
talking sense, the Kundalini is up there;
you see it come up and goes down. Still he's

385
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:53,140
not established himself; the same fellow who
became the Pope. But why they make out of

386
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:01,340
it is this because Mr. Paul who is in the
Bible. I don't know why he's there; has done

387
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:13,930
all this. Now first you must ask Me a question
'Why Mother Mr. Paul is there in the Bible?'

388
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,550
Can you explain to Me that?

389
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:24,200
He never saw Christ; he had nothing to do
with Christ. Now I am asking you a simple

390
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:31,200
question you see, from God's side. Somebody
must ask from God's side also sometimes some

391
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,720
questions. All right now this gentleman was
just torturing Christians, he becomes epileptic,

392
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:46,940
he sees some cross as he says. Whatever it
is, sees something so what? And then he is

393
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:54,330
in the Bible. How come? Now he is not a free
soul. If you accept Paul, this I had said

394
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:07,170
long time back, you will have to give up Christ
and that's what is happening today. All right

395
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:16,730
and even Protestants because I took My birth
in Protestants, among Protestants. I know

396
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:23,730
them. I know about all of them - Christians
and Hindus and Muslims and every one, are

397
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:29,810
all funny fanatics. But the Protestants are
very sophisticated fanatics. It's impossible

398
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:36,810
to talk to them, specially in India. Oh baba!
They are so sophisticated, they've done all

399
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:47,080
the science of the Bible. They've made science
out of Bible. Bible is so great how can you

400
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:55,070
put it in the science? Science is a wee part
of it. You agree there with Me? So now first

401
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:05,860
let us accept we are first and foremost human
beings and we have to become super human beings

402
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:11,460
as realized souls. Whether you are Christian,
Catholics, Hindus, Muslims anything. It should

403
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,460
be such, how can it be different? Does God
know that you went to a Anglican Church or

404
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:27,190
to another Church? Does he, will he know?
Accha tell Me, do you think he will know all

405
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:31,940
these things? Do you think? Somebody must
be keeping a record. Do you think so? I mean

406
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:38,940
is it not ridiculous the way we fight about
these things. Can He keep record of all these

407
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,390
things?

408
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:50,390
And it's not only about Christians, it's same
in Hindus. Hindus are very fanatic, Sikhs

409
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:57,870
are fanatics, Muslims are fanatics; all blind
people are there. But they are good people

410
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:03,900
you know? They believe in it. They are innocent;
they believe that what they believe into is

411
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:10,900
the truth. They have to just know that the
truth is universal and is for everyone. You

412
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,730
cannot claim anyone as your own. Actually
by that you've killed the truth. Like a tree

413
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:24,170
has many flowers, living flowers you pluck
some of them saying this; this is mine, this

414
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:31,170
is mine and the flower dies and that ugly
flower becomes your fanatic religion. It's

415
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:39,650
not a living flower. In Sahaja Yoga we know
that all Prophets were right. What They said

416
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:49,450
were right; we believe in Them. We use Them
on these different centers and all the incarnations

417
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:56,600
we use, but as far as the outside religions
are concerned we think they need some cleansing

418
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:05,310
and light. Then everything will be all right.

419
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:14,650
You are Catholic? I mean you educated, I am
sorry now you are no. But whether the education

420
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:21,820
was in Catholic Church? If you want to hear
about Christians, go and ask Muslims. If you

421
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:29,110
want to hear about Muslims, go and ask Hindus.
If you want to hear about Hindus, go and ask

422
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:33,940
Buddhist. You'll get the full picture about
them. You see we can see what others are we

423
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:39,860
don't see what we are. True.

424
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:46,860
Sahaja Yogi: Any other question? Mother's
going to give you the experience tonight,

425
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,480
so why don't we do it now? Just lift your
shoes off so that your feet...

426
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:02,480
Mother: You better take out your shoes. That's
all I make humble request, that's all. I hope

427
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:24,050
it's not difficult to take them out. I'll
stand up I think. Paul, can you help Me please?

428
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:48,000
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to stand....

429
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Mother: There are lots of saints behind sitting
there and you all have to become saints. For

430
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:07,270
that just you have to put your hands on your
lap as they do for Namaz like that because

431
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:14,800
these fingers as you will see there are indicative
of your sympathetic nervous systems, left

432
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:22,660
and right and they form centers. So just put
your hands like this. Now this hand represents

433
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:36,090
the power of desire as you will see on the
left hand side and this hand represents the

434
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:43,150
power of action. Now what we have to do is
to release our own centers by giving help

435
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:57,060
to them and the Kundalini will then rise immediately
because if the centers are augmented or constricted

436
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:08,400
then Kundalini has to fight it. To make things
easier for Her, we'll have to put our hand,

437
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:16,610
right hand on different centers, which I'll
tell you, which is very simple. You don't

438
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,920
have to do much about it.

439
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:25,920
So now the right hand that is the power of
action we'll be using for touching different

440
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:34,480
parts like the heart, the stomach, the lower
part of the stomach, then here at the base

441
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:42,350
of the neck like this and then here on the
forehead. Ultimately on top of our head where

442
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:50,850
the bone was soft, the fontanel bone area.
That's all. It's very simple one by one I

443
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,680
will tell you. Another thing very important
is that you should not open your eyes till

444
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,680
I tell you because the happening has to take
place within. Your attention should be inside

445
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:09,100
and not outside. It will be sucked in. You
don't have to do, don't fight with it, don't

446
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:14,630
fight with your thoughts, don't fight with
anything. Just let it loose it will work out.

447
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:21,630
You have to sit comfortably in a straight
manner without being lousy or without being

448
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:27,120
over alert. Just sit in a very comfortable
manner with your left hand towards Me and

449
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,880
the right hand on the heart. You may take
out your spectacles or anything because you

450
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,670
have to keep your eyes shut all the time.
It helps also the eye sight. Now put the left

451
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,590
hand on your heart.

452
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,150
Sahaja Yogi: Right hand

453
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:47,150
Mother: I am sorry put your right hand on
the heart and left hand towards Me.

454
00:58:54,770 --> 00:59:01,770
At the very outset I have to tell you one
thing that you should not feel guilty about

455
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:08,800
anything because that's one of the biggest
hurdles in the West. So before saying anything

456
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,750
you have to tell yourself that 'I am not guilty,
I am not guilty, I am not guilty'. Close your

457
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:21,750
eyes and say that. You are not to put your
neck very much backwards or forward or in

458
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:35,670
any abnormal way, but sit comfortably. Now,
on the heart you have to put your right hand

459
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:45,980
and all the time keep the left hand towards
Me. At this stage you have to ask Me a question

460
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,230
because I said you are a computer and this
is a very absolute question. You can call

461
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:01,420
Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever suits you.

462
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:08,420
'Mother, am I the Spirit?' Ask this question,
three times. Please don't open your eyes,

463
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:35,680
keep the left hand towards Myself and put
your right hand on your stomach in the upper-part;

464
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,180
in the upper-part of the abdomen on the left
hand side. We have to just look after the

465
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:49,180
left hand side of our centers. So put the
right hand on the left hand side of the upper

466
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:58,070
part of your stomach. Here lies the center
of mastery; the Guru, the Prophets. So here

467
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:12,620
you have to say, because you have already
asked a question that 'Mother, am I the Spirit?'

468
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:23,670
You have to ask now another question relevantly
with it. 'Mother, am I my own Guru?' Because

469
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:30,670
if you are the master, if you are the Spirit,
automatically you become the master. Unless

470
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,420
and until you are the Spirit you do not become
the master. So the second question should

471
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:46,420
be 'Mother am I my own master? Am I my own
Guru? Mother, am I the Prophet?' Three times

472
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,880
please.

473
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,880
Now, now we start with the real asking by
putting our right hand in the lower part of

474
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:32,980
our abdomen in the left hand side. The right
hand on the lower part of our abdomen, stomach,

475
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:44,369
on the left hand side and press it a little
bit. Here now is the beginning of asking for

476
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:56,610
the true knowledge, for the true technique,
for the pure knowledge. So please ask Me six

477
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:06,710
times because this center is very important
and has six petals, six sub plexuses it controls.

478
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Please ask six times because I cannot force
you to do it unless and until you ask for

479
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:23,420
it because you are free. To respect your freedom
I have tell you that you have to ask 'Mother

480
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:31,340
may I have the true knowledge, the pure knowledge
of the Spirit?' six times. Now you must be

481
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:45,430
confident about it, you should not be diffident,
you should ask with full confidence.

482
01:03:55,450 --> 01:04:02,450
Now, six times. Please don't feel guilty and
be confident. Now we have to raise it so we

483
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:26,110
go back to the same position on the left side
of our stomach in the upper part. Please put

484
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:34,480
your right hand on the upper part of your
abdomen on the left hand side. Now here you

485
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:44,760
have to assert with full confidence. Ten times
you have to say because there are ten valences

486
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:51,890
we have, we have Ten Commandments and ten
times the Primordial Master incarnated on

487
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:58,890
this Earth. So we have to say ten times in
full confidence 'Mother I am my own master.

488
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:12,500
Mother I am my own Guru. Mother I am the Prophet'.
Now please say it ten times. Don't feel guilty,

489
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,830
please don't feel guilty.

490
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:55,830
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

491
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:05,460
Now ten times; raise your right hand after
saying ten times, to your heart. Again here

492
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:21,390
there are twelve sub plexuses, so you have
to assert with full confidence by saying 'Mother

493
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:33,220
I am the Spirit', which is the truth. Without
feeling guilty you must say that because God

494
01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:02,430
is the ocean of love, he is the ocean of compassion.
He is the ocean of forgiveness and what kind

495
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:13,670
of guilt you can have? What kind of sin you
can commit that He cannot forgive? So don't

496
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:22,110
try to count your sins and count your mistakes
and count your guilt just say, 'Mother I am

497
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,490
the Spirit'.

498
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:37,490
Now saying this about twelve times you raise
your right hand at the base of the neck and

499
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:06,740
press it hard on the shoulder. This center
is always caught up. So again I have to say

500
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:20,490
that for sixteen times you have to say, 'Mother
I am not guilty' and if you have the habit

501
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:27,210
of feeling guilty too much better say it hundred
and eight times to punish your self. I am

502
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:32,420
assuring you that you are not guilty but if
you want to say that again and again all right

503
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,350
go ahead with it for hundred and eight times.
Don't feel guilty otherwise you'll miss the

504
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:37,780
point.

505
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:44,780
[ Shri Mataji guides someone in the audience]
From the front hold it from the front not

506
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:54,080
from the back, 'saamne se hath lijiye, aise
pichese nahin, saamne se haath lijiye', tell

507
01:08:57,339 --> 01:09:04,339
him. That gentleman also, that one. Haan!
Better from the front, much better.

508
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:36,390
Sixteen times; believe in yourself. Have faith
in yourself, forgive yourself. First of all

509
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:44,150
you forgive yourself. Or at the most you can
say that 'O Lord forgive me', but don't feel

510
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:54,450
guilty while saying that.

511
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:05,200
[Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You shouldn't disturb,
I know what to do. I don't want to listen

512
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,310
to you.]

513
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Now... you have to raise your hand up to your
forehead 
and here you have to say in a very simple

514
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:33,640
words, 'Mother I forgive everything, I forgive
everyone' with full heart in it. Now some

515
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:42,680
people told Me it's very difficult and this
and that but actually when you don't forgive,

516
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:49,680
what do you do? Or when you forgive what do
you do? Nothing, it's all mythical. On the

517
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:59,920
contrary you are torturing yourself by not
forgiving. So please say from your heart,

518
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:11,190
'Mother I forgive everyone'; on your forehead.

519
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:30,430
Now, now raise your hand on top of your head,
put it on the fontanel bone area, your palm

520
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:50,590
and press it and move it clockwise, your scalp.
At this point you have to say, 'Mother please

521
01:11:55,170 --> 01:12:02,170
give me my Realization' because I cannot cross
your freedom again. This you have to say seven

522
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:11,970
times. But before doing that please say that,
'If I have done anything wrong, O Lord please

523
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:19,530
forgive me'. Without feeling guilty again;
three times. Now seven times you say, 'Mother

524
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:36,130
please give me my Self-Realization' because
I cannot cross.

525
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:43,130
[Mother blows the Cool Breeze twice...]

526
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:03,590
[What heat baap re...]

527
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,470
Now take down that hand.

528
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:17,370
[Mother blows Cool Breeze twice.]

529
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:24,370
Now put the left hand on top of your head
about four inches above and see for yourself

530
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,940
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in.

531
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:36,940
[Mother blows Cool Breeze seven times]

532
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:20,739
Now change your hands and see for yourself
if there's a Cool Breeze coming in. Right

533
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:27,900
side is clear, good. Now left side. Again
change your hands and see if there is a Cool

534
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:05,890
Breeze coming. Ah! better.

535
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:16,010
Mother to Sahaja Yogi: You have to ask the
master question, Holy Ghost; later not just

536
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:31,960
now.

537
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:38,720
Mother: Now those who are not feeling the
Cool Breeze raise your hands please. Please

538
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:45,140
raise them high so that they could see. Now
the Sahaja Yogis will come and attend to you.

539
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:51,560
Now don't get upset with them. If you are
not feeling the Cool Breeze raise your hands

540
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:58,560
and if you are feeling it you got it. She's
got it, Vishuddhi, it is, she feels guilty.

541
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:16,270
You felt it? Have you felt it? Not yet? All
right; Aapko nahin hua? Aarahe hai. Some have

542
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:33,680
felt, some have not felt doesn't matter.

543
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,000
Sahaja Yogi: Just describe again what they
should feel

544
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Mother: You should feel a Cool Breeze coming
out of your head like a cooler. There might

545
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:51,950
be hot coming in doesn't matter. You got it?

546
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:58,930
Sahaja Yogi: ...He's got a Cool Breeze coming
from his hand into his head.

547
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:05,930
Mother: Correct! Now just see if it is coming
from your head or not. Just check. Tell him

548
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:17,550
to say that 'Mother come in my head'. This
lady, Derrick you go, just come and see. It's

549
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,989
better now, see. You may ask 'Is this the
Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?' What about

550
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:28,650
this lady? Ya, no somebody should attend to
her and this one. Is there some another way

551
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:31,050
someone should come and attend to this lady?
'Aaapka nahin hua? Ho gaye? Aaraha hai? Ho

552
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,410
gaye paar? Paar utara gaye sant jana re. Haan'

553
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:35,140
From the audience: There's slight tingling
on this palm.

554
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:42,140
Mother: In the left hand? Ask him to ask the
question of Holy Ghost. On the left hand if

555
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,310
they have tingling you can very easily do
that.

556
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:49,760
Sahaja Yogi: Anyone who's getting the tingling
or not getting the vibrations on the left

557
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,010
hand...

558
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,520
Mother: No, no let them tell them privately;
don't make it open

559
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,090
Sahaja Yogi:...just put your left hand to
Mother.

560
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:53,420
Mother: Ask the question

561
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,750
Sahaja Yogi: Give me the Cool Breeze of the
Holy Ghost.

562
01:17:55,750 --> 01:18:02,180
Mother: No, 'Are You the, Mother are You the
Holy Ghost?' I am asking to ask 'Mother are

563
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:09,180
You the Holy Ghost?' Aa raha hai (it's coming?)
left hand towards Me. Left hand towards Me.

564
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:25,880
From the audience: 'Mother, are You the Holy
Ghost? Are You the Holy Spirit?

565
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:32,820
Mother: All right the tingling has gone, the
answer has come, now recognize. May God bless

566
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:33,070
you. Now this gentleman, what about the one
who was worried about the Pope? Did he feel

567
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,110
the Cool Breeze? This lady she's got it. What
about you?

568
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:33,140
Lady from the seekers: ...tingle

569
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,150
Mother: tingle on both the hands?

570
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:33,160
Lady: ..On both the hands

571
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,170
Mother: She has both the hands give her a
bandhan. Haan ab bas shanti dharo, chit mein

572
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,800
hi shanti. This gentleman - Maria? You have
not forgiven; keep your eyes open and watch

573
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,400
Me and say 'Mother I forgive'.

574
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,300
Seeker: Mother I forgive everyone. Mother
I forgive everyone.

575
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,090
Sahaja Yogi: Getting less tingle? Just say
it again ..., while looking at Mother.

576
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,340
Mother: Ho gaya jagaran? Have got it. You
got it sir? Inke bhi ho gaya (he also got

577
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,340
it). Aap unke sar pe dekhiye aura (you see
on top of his head, aura). Haan has he got

578
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,340
it? Tingling left? Ask him to ask the question
of the Holy Ghost, you ask.

579
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,340
Just enjoy don't think about it; just enjoy
yourself, you got it. Now you have to establish

580
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,800
yourself that's the most important part and
in Leicester we have a very powerful Sahaja

581
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,140
Yogi, .. has spoken to you.

582
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:38,810
Sahaja Yogi: Just say 'Shri Mataji are You
the Holy Ghost? Shri Mataji are You the Holy

583
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:39,060
Ghost?'

584
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,070
Mother: Holy Ghost mane [means] Adi Shakti.
Haan

585
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,150
Sahaja Yogi: You are feeling it on your left
hand?

586
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,250
Mother: That's the answer. What about this
lady? She got it? She's got it.

587
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:39,390
Sahaja Yogi: ...she is Sahaja Yogi

588
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,450
What about her? Haan what about this one,
this gentleman with spectacles? Is she all

589
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,400
right...? Good. Dekhiye sab paar hogaye. Tell
him not to feel guilty. This gentleman here

590
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,350
Sahaja Yogi: Yellow shirt

591
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,900
Mother: Yellow shirt, please don't feel guilty.
What about the gentleman behind.....he's all

592
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,790
right, he's got it, he's got it. John you
better get their names, who belong to Leicester.

593
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,520
Maria, Maria come. Gavin I saw I think?

594
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,180
Sahaja Yogini: Yes he's here.

595
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,910
Mother: He's here; all right, all right. What
do you say comes up and down? Tie it up, tie

596
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,160
it up. Gavin...

597
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,170
Sahaja Yogi: ..he's the Indian gentleman

598
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,340
Mother: Haan he's what? Ask him to pull his
ears.

599
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:49,370
Sahaja Yogi: He's feeling it now, he pulled
his ears. Please work in silence. Please work

600
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:49,420
in silence. Please work in silence.

601
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:49,430
Sahaja yogi: It's very important that you
should follow-up this experience. There is

602
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:49,890
a center in Leicester and at that center they
can teach you very simple techniques some

603
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:50,489
of which you've seen being done now to purify
and remove these blockages in the charkas.

604
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:51,120
They'll teach you how to raise your Kundalini
how to establish it, how to develop your vibrations

605
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:51,710
and then ultimately how to cure yourself,
how to cure others and how to give others

606
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:52,160
self-realization. It's so simple that you
have to work it out together. John is going

607
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,820
to be here ultimately and meanwhile they are
going to have regular meetings so that you

608
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,070
can follow it up. John will tell you little
more.

609
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,290
[Mother: Agya; she has very bad Agya. Ask
her to forgive everyone.]

610
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:53,610
John: We'll be holding meetings every Thursday
evening at his place; probably in the other

611
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:54,000
room but in this building, 7.30 Thursday evenings.
If you come along we can help you to maintain

612
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,340
this experience and also to deepen it because
what's happened this evening is like a seed

613
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:57,110
as I say it's not become a old tree yet. It's
still a seed so by nurturing it, protecting

614
01:18:57,110 --> 01:19:04,110
it, watering it so on. It will enable it to
grow and that's what you can do at these meetings.

615
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,480
Very soon you can learn as much as the Sahaja
Yogis here have learnt, maybe even more hopefully

616
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:12,230
by Shri Mataji's blessings. There's an address
list that we are taking if you'd like to leave

617
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:12,920
us your name and address we can then get in
touch and you know in any other big meetings

618
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,670
we can send you a post card reminding you
where our regular meetings are and we'll also

619
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:15,870
put in the address of the center, the Sahaja
Yoga center and then if you have any problems

620
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,060
any [stage?] or anything like that you can
contact us and we can tell you what to do

621
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:18,920
and so on. Thank you very much

622
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,200
[Mother: So I am very thankful for all this...What
was the name of the gentleman on the TV?

623
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:22,980
Sahaja yogi: The interviewer?

624
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,720
Mother: No the other person. He's the main
person...

625
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,260
Sahaja yogi: He's the editor, the film editor.]

626
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,580
Mother: Now I have to tell you one thing,
you should not discuss about your realization

627
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:30,500
too much. Please Sahaja Yogis also should
know. You see you are all Sahaja Yogis and

628
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:37,500
you have achieved it, but they are still just,
they have just gone into it. So try to understand,

629
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,200
they are not like you that whatever is the
situation you keep there. They, you have attained

630
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:58,989
it, they have to attain still. So keep quiet
and another thing is please don't think about

631
01:19:58,989 --> 01:19:59,700
it don't talk about it too much. Work it out.
Its not that by talking is will work out on

632
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,890
the contrary the more you'll think about it
the worse it will be. It's like a small little

633
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:07,310
plant, a little shoot. We have to be now careful
with it, respect it and gradually when you'll

634
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,060
be coming to those meetings you'll develop
it. While the Sahaja Yogis who are here, all

635
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,489
are experts and whatever may happen even there's
earthquake...
