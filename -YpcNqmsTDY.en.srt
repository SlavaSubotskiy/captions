1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:07,940
[CLAPPING]

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,620
We said on our National television to day that

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,880
sahaja yoga is a respectable yoga

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,620
because of some so called yogas that have gone before.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,320
Shri Mataji has come to

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,380
show us the truth because that's what we all desire for.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,940
That we have a special reason for existence -

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,860
- it is to find the truth.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,340
And those of us who have been blessed to be with Her

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,600
have found the truth. So She's come to Sydney

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,600
to tell us about the truth.

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,660
In a very troubled world, has arrived with

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,720
many other wrong answers to our troubles - the answers of drugs, hard and soft

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,540
and other things that distract us - we found that those are not the answer.

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Holy Mother thank You for coming and thank You for being with us.

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,980
So, once again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,040
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
The idea about truth

19
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,740
is sometimes a misconception.

20
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,640
Truth is what it is and will be the truth.

21
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,160
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,460
we cannot work it out - it remains what it is.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,620
And the greatest truth is that we all have become human beings

24
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,960
to become the spirit. We're still

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,760
not in that stage that's why there are problems around us.

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,320
Once you become the truth, it being the Absolute,

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,900
you reach the state of Absoluteness. Then there is

28
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,700
no difference of ideologies,

29
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,740
no differences of nation -

30
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,380
- all nations one knows are created by God Almighty.

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:28,620
Just He created variety to give a beautiful world to us.

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,760
Variety always gives beauty.

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,480
That's why this variety was created just to make the world very interesting

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,180
but not for fighting or for quarreling or for believing

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,880
that this part belongs to us and that part belongs to somebody else.

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,620
The human problem, as I have studied, is very simple -

37
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,920
- is to be understood in a detached way.

38
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:28,660
Now here you can see the beautiful machinery that is working within ourselves.

39
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:37,260
If you see on the left-hand side we have [ASIDE - SOMEBODY SHOULD COME AND SHOW] blue colored line

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,120
and the right-hand side you see a yellow line.

41
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,680
In the center you see a white channel

42
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,440
These are our Autonomous Nervous Systems - three channels -

43
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,860
Left and Right Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

44
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:12,120
When I talk of Medical Science people get quite surprised.

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,140
But it has something to do to understand what are we inside ourselves.

46
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,480
Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system that gives us balance.

47
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,140
For example, if I'm running fast, My heart will start thumping

48
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,180
but it comes to normal through Parasympathetic Nervous System.

49
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,420
And Medical Science doesn't know much about the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is actually in the center.

50
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,100
These chakras are around the Parasympathetic Nervous System and

51
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:01,440
like My fingers here, this is the chakra in the center here

52
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,860
and this the Left Sympathetic and this the Right Sympathetic and they both put together make this center

53
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,920
to form the Parasympathetic - simple as that.

54
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,120
Now what happens with human-beings, that they have a capacity, they have a freedom also

55
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:30,060
to go to the left or to the right. They can be very emotional people.

56
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,600
They can go to the emotional side to such an extent that they can become fanatics.

57
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,460
They can go further with it so that

58
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,260
the left side which represents our Subconscious,

59
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,700
then the Collective Subconscious can be entered into.

60
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,480
So they can enter into Collective Subconscious also.

61
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,200
Subconscious also has 3 - 4 layers that is we can say the Present Subconscious,

62
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,620
the Past Subconscious and the Subconscious of ages.

63
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,480
Then the Collective Subconscious where all that is dead exists in that area.

64
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:33,420
Now, when you move too much on that side, you get attacked by that side

65
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:42,320
and that side has got all that is dead which attacks you, which triggers you.

66
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,000
On the right hand side we have got another channel of the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

67
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,740
This channel represents our activity and our future.

68
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:13,420
So when you're overactive, you're working very hard, you're futuristic - all the time thinking about the future

69
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,900
- you start moving towards the right side

70
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:26,960
to such an extent that you can enter into your Collective Supra-conscious also.

71
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,080
In the same way you have got your Present Supra-conscious and also Collective Supra-conscious.

72
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,780
Now, human beings have a capacity, that they can move to the left and to the right with their attention.

73
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:51,240
They can project their attention to the left or to their right or they can be moderate in the center.

74
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,340
So, when people talked of religion - I mean the real people who came on this earth, they talked of religion -

75
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:08,500
they talked about our valency, that's a human valency is of ten number -

76
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,280
and that's why they talked of ten commandments. Or in every religion they talked about it

77
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,220
that we have to keep this balance. When we go out of this balance

78
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,800
then we either move to the left or to the right.

79
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,260
But, if you see the history of religions, it is just the opposite.

80
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,660
That all these religions have created conditionings within us -

81
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,220
a kind of a fanatism, a kind of a blind faith

82
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,380
which was never the purpose of establishing your

83
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,480
valencies within yourself.

84
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,880
The movement to the right is also another problem of the modern times.

85
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,080
When we move to the right, we actually start becoming very egoistical.

86
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,240
The activity that we form, the activity that we perform

87
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,660
creates a balloon like structure on our head, as you see, crossing over here,

88
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,500
as ego - that yellow stuff.

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,160
On the left hand side when we're conditioned very much, we get another balloon, which we call as super-ego.

90
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,000
Jung also, missed the point because he described

91
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,840
that there're layers horizontally placed within ourselves - it is not so.

92
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,780
God, is a great constructor and a manager.

93
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:13,740
For example, you have put a road for Me here - I don't have to pass through different, different rows.

94
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,020
In the same way He placed everything in a vertical way

95
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,060
and the road to realization is kept free within us.

96
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
The road to realization is straightforward, which you see,

97
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,780
is the shown in the white color, is the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

98
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Now those people who move to the left or to the right, develop diseases.

99
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,060
For example, I'll show you here, now supposing, I move one finger too much here

100
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,700
then I'm cut off, cut off with the main -

101
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,720
this side is cut off with the main, this side is cut off with the main. Then what happens that there is no control

102
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,640
and the cells become malignant, on their own. They start over-powering others

103
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,480
and that's how they start destroying other cells - we say cancer has been established.

104
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,060
Is a very simple thing, is to bring them back again and put them in contact

105
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,660
with the Divine and bring them to the mains.

106
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Secondly, people have these days diseases like Diabetes - very common, Diabetes is a very common disease.

107
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,620
Now in Indian villages, the villagers when they take tea

108
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,240
they say, the we must take so much sugar that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

109
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,800
And they drink such a lot of sugar - they never have Diabetes, never - they have never known Diabetes.

110
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,920
What is the cause of Diabetes or liver trouble

111
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,780
or we can say, other troubles like Blood Cancer?

112
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,080
Is a very simple thing that we do - is the imbalance within us.

113
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,280
Is you see, the yellow center we call as Swadhisthana,

114
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,560
which looks after the Aortic plexus in our body, on the physical level,

115
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,040
this center has a very special work to do

116
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,980
that is to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain.

117
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,380
So it converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

118
00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:00,160
If people are very futuristic - all the time thinking, thinking, thinking - then this poor

119
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,020
center or chakra has one work, is to convert cells after cells for the use of the brain.

120
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,440
Brain starts growing but what about the other function it has to do?

121
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,460
It has to look after the liver, it has to look after the pancreas,

122
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:29,540
it has to look after the spleen, it has to look after part of the intestines and also the kidneys.

123
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,200
When we start thinking too much, we give too much work to this one center

124
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,200
all these visceras are neglected and you may develop any one of these troubles.

125
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,100
But when it comes to spleen, it is even worse.

126
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,900
When it comes to spleen - these days the life is so hectic - first of all,

127
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:02,800
we get up in the morning, first thing we do is to read the newspaper - that's the horrid thing to do.

128
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,900
Coming out of very nice sleep, you suddenly read the newspaper and so many are bombed,

129
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,640
so many are killed and so many are harassed - Oh God!

130
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,900
You get a shock, the system gets a shock.

131
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,840
Now, when the system gets a shock, the spleen has to

132
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,740
produce more Red blood corpuscles - it has to work very hard.

133
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,140
Then you suddenly discover, you have to go to your work, so you get out of your bed and rush here and there,

134
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,340
brush your teeth on your way and carry your breakfast - maybe your wife is running after you with the breakfast - you have no time for anything.

135
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,640
Such a hectic life you lead - extremely hectic.

136
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,800
Then you get into the car, you find there's a jam - finished.

137
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,600
Is a, we don't understand how much you're shocking ourselves all the time.

138
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,420
We are on a war path with the watch.

139
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,680
All the time struggling for time, struggling for time.

140
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,460
This spleen doesn't understand the person -

141
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,860
there's no rhythm in the life of that person.

142
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:24,800
The spleen thinks, what am I to do now? Suddenly this person needs the Red blood corpuscles, then it doesn't need, then suddenly it needs it - it becomes hectic.

143
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:34,660
It needs hec.. when it becomes hectic, it becomes vulnerable for Blood Cancer.

144
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:43,280
And then, if a person gets any shock or goes to the left side in an emotional way, he gets Blood Cancer.

145
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,960
Even the mothers who are like this, very hectic, disciplining their children, "Keep the carpet clean,

146
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,220
eh..walk this way, first put your right foot then left foot, don't walk that way" -

147
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,540
the child, when she's pregnant, can get Blood Cancer.

148
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,780
We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God, we're human beings

149
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,320
and the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

150
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:28,340
This is the blossom time. But we shock our system with so many things - for what have we achieved?

151
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,580
In India we have Taj Mahal, we have Ajanta caves, we have so many things to show you

152
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,360
but they are all in the past. I don't think in Sydney you can make a hall like this anymore - is not possible.

153
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,460
What have we achieved - plastics?

154
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,080
What are we achieving?

155
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:06,080
The modern times we have lost the sense of greatness and glorious things.

156
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,520
All the time you're struggling with time and no body has time.

157
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,420
Everybody is rushing up. I asked one gentleman, "Why're you in such a hurry to go to London, after all,

158
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,960
it's all right you can go tomorrow, if you don't get the seat today you can go tomorrow?"

159
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,100
He said, "No, I have to attend a ball."

160
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,660
He'll waste 3 hours in the ball or in a pub, that's all right.

161
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,780
But, he's so worried about getting his ticket - for that he will completely rattle his system.

162
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,920
Just to get the ticket and that for what?

163
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,500
That ball is not going to give him any relaxation because he's already finished his system.

164
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,300
That's how one develops this Blood Cancer.

165
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,040
Then the pancreas is out of order, one develops Diabetes

166
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,900
Kidneys are out of order - high blood pressure.

167
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,980
Then all kinds of kidney troubles and then they go on the machine and all kinds of things happen.

168
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,720
It is happening in all the nonsensical things also we have taken.

169
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,260
Like for us now, so far he was, Mr. Freud was

170
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,420
had displaced Christ completely. He had become Christ for us.

171
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,880
Blind-folded we followed him and also out-witted him

172
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,260
in our projections. "What's wrong?"

173
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,880
When I went to America in '73

174
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,860
I told them that this is all wrong you're doing, it will have a very bad effect, it's not natural.

175
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,360
If promiscuousness is good, then why does it give diseases?

176
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,720
If it is natural, then why does it give you problems - simple question?

177
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,760
There's a kind of a ego that we can do it - but why fight with the nature?

178
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,040
If you fight with the nature, nature will take it's respite.

179
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,780
And today that's why, we have to say, "This was wrong we have done and we're not going to do it anymore."

180
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Our children are not going to do it.

181
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,860
After going through all the experiences now they're talking that cigarette should be abandoned.

182
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,140
But Nanak Sahab had told long time back that cigarette is the worst thing, it will cause horrible trouble to you.

183
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,000
Now they're saying about no smoking - now they cannot give up.

184
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,460
There are thousand and one problems - the greatest is, I think now, is AIDS -

185
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,160
is caused by nothing but stupid ego.

186
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Anything they try, you ask them why do you do it ; like some people are now coloring their heads.

187
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,520
And I found some of them are becoming blind. So I said, "Why are you doing it?" They said, "What's wrong?"

188
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,720
But why do you want to color your hair? "But what's wrong?" I didn't know what to answer.

189
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,260
I said, "But it will make you blind." "We'll see when it makes us blind." - Such arrogance!

190
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:20,240
You can't challenge your system like that, you have to be humble about it because it's a delicate system of a human being.

191
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,040
We are not hippopotamus, are we? That on a hippopotamus you paint anything, nothing will happen to him.

192
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,100
But we're human beings, we have got cells here, which absorb paints and that can go on to our nerves,

193
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,900
can also go on to our other centers.

194
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,200
There should be a basic understanding - what is ridiculous?

195
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:02,680
As if, people have gone a muck and doing all these things - but that's what, you're going to the left or to the right.

196
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,580
Now, those people who move too much to the right, get heart attacks.

197
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:19,960
They maybe thin like dried fishes but they can get heart attacks.

198
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,620
When you extract too much of your energy on the right side, the heart gives in.

199
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,020
There is no need to put in so much effort

200
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,620
- like one day I met a lady who had a heart attack -

201
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,380
she's just a housewife with only two children.

202
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:00,000
I said, "Why do you get a heart attack, madam?" She said, "I've to work very hard, You know."

203
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:07,900
"With two children what do you do?" "Oh, I've to keep everything clean, absolutely clean,

204
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,100
to keep my children clean, I've to keep my husband clean, I've to keep my bathroom clean, to keep," and I said,

205
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,500
"It's all right, but why don't you understand that also your health is there and you should take some rest in between."

206
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,600
"No, to me cleanliness is everything." Then you have the heart attack.

207
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,640
This is the norms of today's life.

208
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't think our parents used to polish everything all the time

209
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,140
or they were all the time with a vacuum cleaner, you see, like a tail we have a vacuum cleaner with us.

210
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:52,480
Doesn't matter, it's house. After all, it should be a cozy place for children

211
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,960
and for the husband to come down. Doesn't matter, once you clean it, it's all right.

212
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,240
But that kind of a attitude we cannot take because that's the norm.

213
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,560
So many norms we have which are really absurd and ridiculous.

214
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,200
We can never sit down and enjoy each other's company.

215
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:24,340
If the husband and wife are sitting, there should be a television in between or some sort of a drama or something.

216
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:32,220
There should be something in between, they cannot talk to each other - there's no relaxing mood.

217
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,040
There's so much to be talked between husband and wife.

218
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,840
I mean, when husband wife are enjoying themselves and talking to each other, it's better to switch off the horrible

219
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,900
television which is showing the quarrel between husband and wife all the time.

220
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,860
So, all these things work out - the family system, the household and the all the norms we have started.

221
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,240
All these things work out on our sweet beautiful system that we have.

222
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,120
We are fighting all the time with each other, for what?

223
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:22,280
This is what takes us to the extremes and these extremes are responsible for giving us all these problems.

224
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,140
Now, with the Kundalini awakening, when She rises, passes through those centers -

225
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,220
first of all She puts them like a slot, they all come back,

226
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,880
fall in lines, She awakens them, gives them energy, the energy flows out

227
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,740
cures cancer, cures this, cures that, cures that.

228
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,980
Then it passes through your Agnya chakra here, where you forgive everyone.

229
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:05,620
You just forgive. You don't know, what a weapon Christ has given us to forgive.

230
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,900
Half of the marriages would be all right if we know how to forgive.

231
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Just makes you a sweet, beautiful, charming person

232
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,940
in the real sense of the word, not outwardly because you're dressed up well or you have

233
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:32,820
a beautiful ornament or something like that. You really become a very charming person in the sense

234
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,440
that you charm the children, you charm your family, you charm the whole world.

235
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,060
Because once you start forgiving, the love of your heart starts pouring everywhere.

236
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,340
When She opens this last center, actually here on the fontanel bone area, where you get your real baptism

237
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,340
this is the, we call the seat of the heart center, seat of the heart center.

238
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,700
When She opens the transformation starts

239
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,700
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So, the transformation in the temperament,

240
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,720
in the behavior of a person - you immediately notice the face changing -

241
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,940
the tense face that you see suddenly becomes mellowed down - we're relaxed.

242
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:43,320
And this Kundalini awakening then kept up well, makes you grow spiritually.

243
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,060
And the spiritual growth in a person is what we want today.

244
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:59,180
Of course, no diseases, no physical problems, no mental problems -

245
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,600
many mad people have been cured, this Schizophrenia has been cured with sahaja yoga.

246
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:13,880
Is all because our spirit has not come into our attention.

247
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,540
Spirit is the light but the light we see here is jarring sometimes -

248
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,640
has nothing in it - the light of the spirit has love -

249
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:35,220
is beautiful love about which we have heard about, which is All Pervading, is all over

250
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,780
and you just feel absolutely sure of yourself as if you're entered

251
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,160
into the beautiful hall of God's kingdom where you're secured, you're respected,

252
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,020
you're loved, you're looked after - is a fact.

253
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,680
But we have to enter there and we have to receive that blessing.

254
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,880
Then this physical things look nothing, insignificant.

255
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,760
If somebody has some problem you can go and cure it, I need not be there.

256
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,280
You can raise the Kundalini of other people. This is your birthright

257
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,800
to get the Kundalini awakened and to have your real baptism.

258
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,300
You have got it within yourself, all is your power - I'm doing nothing,

259
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,320
maybe a catalyst - for a little while and then you become the catalyst.

260
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,440
The whole world can change and transform itself

261
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,580
if it follows the power of love. We have never used the power of love -

262
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,220
is all the power of hatred all the time.

263
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,480
But the power of love that is Divine love is devoid of lust and greed -

264
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,380
is just you enjoy the loving of love.

265
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,900
And that situation when it works, you see the whole world in a different way

266
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,940
and you develop that witness state which is described many a times by many saints

267
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,160
and many prophets and Incarnations.

268
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,280
It's a very easy thing to happen, it is spontaneous because it's the living force,

269
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:39,860
is the living thing - you cannot pay for it, it's ridiculous to think that you can pay for it - you cannot.

270
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:50,400
How much money did we pay to the plants which produce these beautiful flowers - nothing.

271
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,700
They just gave you the flowers because they enjoy giving.

272
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:04,780
That sort of personalities we all become - beautiful people. Actually we have wasted our life quite a lot.

273
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:12,080
After realization we understand how valuable we are, how glorified we are,

274
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:19,760
how God loves us and how He looks after us moment to moment!

275
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,180
These imbalances within us have now increased more by time

276
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:39,260
because the ego increased a lot and then we said, "Why not do this, why not try this, why not try that,"

277
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,180
like everybody going a muck trying this, trying that, trying that. Everything new they should have,

278
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,800
they did not believe in what people told them before, they discarded all that and they said, "Let's try everything new."

279
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,940
Like, the other day we were having a banquet and there was an ambassador sitting next to Me

280
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,480
and he said, "I know, You don't like Freud." Oh, I said, " I don't like him at all."

281
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,920
But he said, "He told us something new, while Hume didn't tell us something new, You see."

282
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,540
I said, "All right, we've had dinner many a times but we have never eaten the table, let's have it."

283
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:29,380
[LAUGHTER] That's a new thing, why not? He was shocked at Me.

284
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,920
He said, " Everything new can be very dangerous."

285
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,740
Let us try with the snakes, let us try with the tigers.

286
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,220
This is the trouble with us. We have to humble down to understand that no, this

287
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,600
is a trust of God within us - this body of ours - we have no business to insult it,

288
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,360
to be disrespectful to it, to waste it - we have to respect it.

289
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:21,280
With what difficulty it was made, the whole, you see, beautiful mechanism that is made within us

290
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,060
and it works so spontaneously, so beautifully -

291
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,920
even whatever you have done to it, doesn't matter, forget it -

292
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,600
even if you have not respected it, forget it.

293
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:44,740
Please don't develop any guilt - that's another disease of the modern times - everybody is guilty.

294
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,540
Why are you guilty? You're human beings, if you have done mistakes so it's all right.

295
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,580
It's for God to correct it - that's His job, so give Him to do that job.

296
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,940
But we shouldn't go on doing the mistakes.

297
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,520
Once we're blessed by Him, let us enjoy.

298
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,400
Now many scientists say that there is no God - I think it's very unscientific to say that.

299
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,220
A scientist must have an open mind.

300
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,540
If he doesn't have an open mind, he's not a scientist at all.

301
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,440
He has not known anything about God, how does he say there's no God.

302
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,240
You may say that the way religion is followed, is wrong - I agree there.

303
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,340
The way they make money in the name of God, is wrong - I agree there - but there is God.

304
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:55,580
Definitely there is God - keep your minds open like a scientist and also,

305
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,220
what I say is a hypothesis to you - tomorrow it will become a law and you'll be amazed

306
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,040
the laws of God's love are so definite,

307
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:20,740
unchangeable, they work so beautifully. For example, when you get your realization

308
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,280
you feel the cool breeze on top of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around your fingers.

309
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,360
These fingers tell you - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

310
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,600
seven centers that are within you - which one is catching.

311
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,860
Is said so - Mohammad Sahab has said, "Your hands will tell you,

312
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,800
they will speak at the time of your resurrection."

313
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,440
Your fingers tell you what's wrong with you, they will tell you what's wrong with another person.

314
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:14,560
And that's absolute - all those who're realized will say the same thing.

315
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,220
What's wrong with this country, what's wrong with that country, and you can verify it.

316
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,720
It's very easy to verify whether it's the truth or not.

317
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,200
Supposing you want to ask a question, "Is there God?" - You'll get tremendous vibrations.

318
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,060
If you say, "Is Freud was a good man?" - You'll get blisters, maybe.

319
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,960
So, it is within you, just to reach that point where you become so sensitive

320
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,840
that you can say what is what and you can verify,

321
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,240
and you can correct yourself, you can diagnose yourself, you can treat yourself, you can treat others,

322
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,600
you can help the whole world. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten many lights -

323
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,380
that's how it is going to work out.

324
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,960
Yesterday we spent a lot of time asking questions.

325
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,520
Today if you want, you can ask but not too many and sensible questions will be better

326
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:44,160
because I'm not here for election. They ask me questions as if I'm standing for some election or asking for goods from you.

327
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,220
I have come here to give you what is yours

328
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,060
- nothing to take.

329
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:07,780
[INAUDIBLE]

330
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:16,020
[INAUDIBLE]

331
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,800
I will, little later we'll do that, that's good. Listening to Me you may not, may some people maybe but you will be.

332
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm happy that you're anxious to get the enlightenment - it's correct, very correct attitude.

333
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,520
Does it, does it matter if you're following another teaching?

334
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Depends on.

335
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:50,420
You see, if you're following the teachings which are against natural things, naturally

336
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:59,060
how can you judge - let us see on Kundalini. Kundalini immediately indicates

337
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:07,960
All right? If you're following a wrong person then it indicates immediately

338
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,840
and then you better give up, all right, in that case. Whatever is good for you, you should take it.

339
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:24,020
There have been horrible people in this world, I must confess.

340
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,140
I'm very sorry, so many have been Indians who came around spoiling the name of India.

341
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,600
I don't know what to say and taking full advantage

342
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,920
of your ignorance about this knowledge.

343
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:56,200
Uh.. I have to just say one thing, that you must give a full test

344
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,480
of these people - take a full understanding - how?

345
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:10,460
For example, if somebody is here and says, "You pay five hundred rupees or five hundred dollars

346
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:19,280
for just seeing my face," - you better never see such a face again. [LAUGHTER]

347
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,020
Or that, "There is some technique which I'll teach you." There is no technique for living things.

348
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,800
It's already built-in, it works out by itself.

349
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,240
Or anybody who says, "There's a course you have to go through," - there is no course.

350
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,200
What is a course of a tree that is growing -  do you give a course to that tree?

351
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,120
All right, you have five days' course - [LAUGHTER] It will grow despite everything.

352
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,760
Then,

353
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,660
you cannot take any money in the name of God.

354
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,560
You cannot live on the earnings in the name of God.

355
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:25,320
We don't believe in priesthoods in sahaja yoga. You have to do your normal work

356
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,840
you have to be married, you must have children, you must live like normal people

357
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,060
and be spiritually developed.

358
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,960
We don't have all these systems that people had

359
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,800
where we become a priest and you pay them money - the priest is taking money and living on that.

360
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,440
God has nothing to do with money, He actually doesn't understand any money.

361
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,400
If you put only this test, then most of them will be finished.

362
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,580
We may say, how are they to live? They should live by, as they have been living.

363
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,100
They can teach in the school, they can sell things in the market, do what they like.

364
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,340
What is the need to take money?

365
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,900
Now for Me, I must say, luckily in this lifetime, I have

366
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,940
a good husband and we're well off but still

367
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:46,420
if these boys want to pay, say, for My travelling they can pay to the travel agent, not to Me.

368
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:58,920
If they give Me any presents, I can return them sweetly, something of the same kind or better.

369
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,920
But there should not be any greed.

370
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,780
Sometimes you feel like giving flowers - all right, then I must also return it.

371
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,020
All matter has this value is to

372
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:27,620
gives and communicate your feelings to another - that's the only thing a matter can do

373
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,680
and that's what we should utilize it for.

374
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:47,980
So this ghost of materialism will drop out. It's a ghost, I tell you and it's growing bigger and bigger.

375
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:56,620
I won't be surprised after some time people won't have their hair, won't have their teeth, won't have their ears left.

376
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,220
Because all kinds of things they tell you to do to your hair, all kinds of things they tell you to do to your face -

377
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,440
I mean, it's going on and on and on.

378
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,880
The kind of food we have to eat, God knows whether we are to eating plastic or polyester. [LAUGHTER]

379
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,880
Everything becoming uh.. materialistic. With sahaja yoga

380
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,700
you can transform non-hybrid seeds for such

381
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:38,880
great germination power that they can produce crops better than hybrid - this we have experimented.

382
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,640
What's this question there? Somebody was asking.

383
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,560
It's gone away or what?

384
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,180
- All right. 
- Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

385
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,120
Can you speak out, it's raining outside, we can't hear?

386
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,740
- She tends to sleep twelve to fourteen hours a day, she said that 
- She sleeps a lot 
- sleeps a lot

387
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,520
You're left sided, that's all - we'll work it out, all right. It's very simple to give a balance to yourself.

388
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,920
That's simple. You're a left sided person, that's why you sleep more.

389
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:49,880
- Can, can somebody stand up and say things? 
- He's asking the question 
- Is he?

390
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:59,020
[INAUDIBLE AND UNCLEAR]

391
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,720
Mother, may Your Holiness explain us

392
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:30,800
whether there is a difference between a knowledge, a steady wisdom and Self- realization?

393
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,660
If there is a difference in what aspect do they differ?

394
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,940
- What is the difference between Self-realization and knowledge? 
- It's just the same. 
- And

395
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:50,160
No difference. You see in the Vedas it is written Vid - Vid is the word used in Sanskrit language -

396
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,440
means to know on your Central Nervous System.

397
00:47:53,820 --> 00:48:00,120
Whatever is known on your Central Nervous System is the knowledge, the rest of it is just

398
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:05,040
'Shabd Pandityam' means only the word, the words.

399
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,980
Words and words. Whatever you know on your Central Nervous System is the Knowledge.

400
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,520
the rest of it is just talking, talking, talking.

401
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:28,360
What's it? - [UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE]

402
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,660
Knowledge, wisdom and Self-realization.

403
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:39,660
Huh.. Now, Knowledge - When you have knowledge you get wisdom automatically - is a result of that, all right?

404
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:55,220
- What is it yet? 
-  [UNCLEAR] he wants to be detached

405
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,200
Yes, by, by realization you become detached and then you become wise.

406
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,840
All right. By Self-realization you automatically become detached

407
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,200
and you develop a witness state and that's how you become wise.

408
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,420
All right, now let others say.

409
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,520
These are half-read Indians. Haan, what's it?

410
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:37,400
- Yes, My child. 
- I have a question about re-birthing and whether that is an advanced technique, it's very common nowadays.

411
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,120
- [UNCLEAR] re-birthing 
- Annh? 
- Re-birthing, the technique of re-birthing

412
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,980
It's the technique that's being solved in, in example in Sydney

413
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,280
- What it is? 
- It's a technique where people are made to re-live their birth

414
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,040
- That's the vogue, that's the fashion? 
- The fashion. 
- What is that?

415
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:12,660
A technique called re-birthing where people pay money and they made to re-live their birth

416
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:19,720
their actual physical birth to clear any sub-conscious', sub-conscious blocks that are there in the system.

417
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,120
She wants to know that's an advanced...
