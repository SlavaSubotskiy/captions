1
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:26,664
This was least expected that we'll have a Puja here or

2
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:31,236
we'll have any program of this kind.

3
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:37,104
But I think something was left out of the whole

4
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:43,616
program of such a fast one as you know

5
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:48,742
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt

6
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:52,251
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

7
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:56,603
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

8
00:06:56,628 --> 00:07:00,184
And I came here in London I learned that

9
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,097
 there was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

10
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,838
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan

11
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:16,029
because it is the sister relationship and brother relationship.

12
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:27,156
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna was born

13
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:29,863
 the day his sister was born,

14
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:40,394
and this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed

15
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,815
I should say, into a lightning later on,

16
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:48,976
but She was the one who announced

17
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:55,456
 the existence of Shri Krishna at that time -

18
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:59,770
that He is born and He is living, He is in the present.

19
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:04,582
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of the lightning,

20
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:10,292
 and you have seen that whenever
I am going to any place, or

21
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:14,060
 I will be giving a program or something, just before that,

22
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,731
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears in the sky, you see,

23
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:22,055
to show that announcement.

24
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:26,826
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

25
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:33,185
To make it more practical and understanding is

26
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:38,760
 that we use electricity now for our televisions,

27
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:43,426
for our announcements, for telling people about messages

28
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:45,943
of something of great importance.

29
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:49,142
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

30
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:54,416
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement

31
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,042
of the coming of Adi Shakti.

32
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:01,734
But on the contrary, people start using it as a pocket

33
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:06,232
kept for our extra ego to be filled.

34
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,951
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty when

35
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:17,327
 our sense of relationships are not all right.

36
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:25,819
For example, we do not understand a sister

37
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:32,599
and a brother, the relationship, which is very pure,

38
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:38,242
and is above all kinds of contamination.

39
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:45,177
But as you know in the West,

40
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,180
because maybe of drinking and doing all kinds of things

41
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:55,257
which are against awareness, people have lost the value system,

42
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,803
and in that they have also lost

43
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,886
the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

44
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,994
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely important -

45
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:19,404
 because of Her, announcement of an incarnation takes place.

46
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,898
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

47
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,602
It works it out.

48
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,227
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides in the left Vishuddhi,

49
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:41,057
 and I find that Vishnumaya is the thing that suffers
the most, especially in the West,

50
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,408
because it's a fashion to feel guilty about everything.

51
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:52,897
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced

52
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:58,408
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing on this Earth,

53
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:03,270
if you see from a practical point of view might think
it's a wrong thing She has done,

54
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,461
 because to tell Kamsa that He exists and He resides,

55
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:12,828
is still existing, is giving Him a danger

56
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:17,109
and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

57
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,810
If I had not told, he would not have known."

58
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:25,306
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

59
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:31,242
So we have to see for ourselves that

60
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:35,313
what makes us guilty for small, small things

61
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,925
is actually is our own ego reacting against us and

62
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,234
wants us to reconcile with what mistakes we have committed.

63
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:48,371
Like some people feel guilty because

64
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:53,139
 they have said something they should not have said,

65
00:11:53,171 --> 00:12:01,776
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

66
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:09,166
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

67
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:13,383
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

68
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,933
They feel guilty.

69
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,958
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,

70
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,760
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

71
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,850
I mean such stupid things like that which are

72
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,630
regarded as norms in the society and people start thinking

73
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:35,025
that these norms are very, very important -
as if they are something like a dharma

74
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,015
and you must maintain those
norms.

75
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,147
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

76
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:48,599
You see some of them are so stupid and so horrifying

77
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:52,596
 that I think, in England I feel,
there are some, which must be really

78
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:56,455
 completely squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

79
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,736
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone,

80
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,862
because God knows what kinds of hands people are having,

81
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:06,274
 what kinds of vibrations they have.

82
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,153
Now, when My husband has his reception
sometimes I have to shake hands

83
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:19,577
with seven hundred people coming in,
and then seven hundred drunkards going out.

84
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:27,768
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

85
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,484
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,

86
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:34,281
 but for others to shake anybody's hand, is better to do Namaste,

87
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:37,928
 though it might be some a very simple Indian method,

88
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,567
but I think is the best way is to say, "Namaste",

89
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:46,649
because shaking hands can cause
 lots of problems to human beings,

90
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:50,782
and now with all these diseases coming up and all that,

91
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:53,848
I think one has to be very careful about shaking hands.

92
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:57,989
Worse than that is in France I find is like

93
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,679
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

94
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:03,249
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

95
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:07,126
But they do kiss you all the time if you go there,

96
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,334
 I had very bad shocks to begin with, you see

97
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,837
anybody would just get you, kiss you here,

98
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:16,506
 kiss you there, you start looking at the person.

99
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:22,024
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

100
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,435
But there is no need to do all,

101
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,304
this is not a very good way of wishing anyone,

102
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,138
 doesn't show any respect, in both the cases.

103
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,016
When you shake hands also there's no respect

104
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,952
and even when you kiss somebody there is no respect.

105
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,484
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",

106
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:42,487
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect,

107
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:46,539
and this is one thing we have to do is to respect each other.

108
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,940
But when we are not then we feel guilty,

109
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:53,813
and like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

110
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,941
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody

111
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,254
then we think we have done a big mistake.

112
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,048
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you know.

113
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:03,822
We get so much used to it,

114
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:09,695
that even if you see a statue you say
"Thank you very much for your darshan."

115
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,878
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit too much.

116
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:16,317
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service - or "sorry".

117
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:21,351
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

118
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,978
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

119
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:29,147
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

120
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:34,089
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

121
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,689
fault of the other person.

122
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:41,219
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

123
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:47,209
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

124
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:53,788
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

125
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:58,629
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

126
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:59,749
person.

127
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:08,491
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

128
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:09,516
matter.

129
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:14,529
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

130
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,559
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

131
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,309
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

132
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:31,429
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

133
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:35,649
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

134
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,909
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

135
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:43,038
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

136
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:47,399
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

137
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,348
car to move and the car was moving.

138
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:52,339
I couldn't understand what was happening.

139
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,609
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

140
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,609
I said, "What's the matter?"

141
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,799
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

142
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,109
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

143
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:01,329
you should say "Thank you".

144
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:07,929
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

145
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,976
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

146
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,329
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

147
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:21,613
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

148
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,728
to people for what they have done.

149
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:29,289
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

150
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:34,054
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

151
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,874
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

152
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:41,405
Either you go to the left or to the right.

153
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:46,254
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

154
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:52,654
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

155
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,424
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

156
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:59,904
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

157
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:06,724
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

158
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:11,914
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

159
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,254
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

160
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,014
Christmas card is not important.

161
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:19,414
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

162
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,724
Is to wish this person.

163
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,463
Do you have that in your heart?

164
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:26,614
Did you feel that from your heart?

165
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:32,424
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

166
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:36,804
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

167
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:42,164
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

168
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:47,523
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

169
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,523
Should have done it.

170
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:51,143
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

171
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:54,964
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

172
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:59,484
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

173
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:05,764
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

174
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,644
have to worry about small, small things.

175
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:12,773
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

176
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:18,407
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

177
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:20,288
from their aggression.

178
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:24,947
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

179
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:29,800
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

180
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:33,491
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

181
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,163
I don't want."

182
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:40,597
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

183
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:43,942
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

184
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:49,072
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

185
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:54,212
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

186
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:59,422
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

187
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:04,732
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

188
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:11,304
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

189
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:13,889
But then he was told about it.

190
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:21,110
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

191
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:23,277
saint I have a duty to perform.

192
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:31,807
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

193
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:40,007
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

194
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:47,977
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

195
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:56,417
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

196
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,811
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

197
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:01,767
the left Vishuddhi.

198
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:08,215
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

199
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:16,038
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

200
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:21,611
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

201
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,198
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

202
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:28,672
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

203
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:34,237
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

204
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,128
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

205
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:44,723
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

206
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:50,946
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

207
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:57,017
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

208
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,696
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

209
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:21,917
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

210
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:47,303
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

211
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:54,794
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

212
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,475
up, face it up and never do it again.

213
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:01,985
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

214
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,399
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

215
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:08,416
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

216
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:12,568
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

217
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,763
Another thing is the announcement.

218
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:19,162
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

219
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:23,973
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

220
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:25,763
have to go on telling about it.

221
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:26,763
It works!

222
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:27,763
It works very well.

223
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:32,764
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

224
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,687
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

225
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:40,202
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

226
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:48,341
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

227
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:51,341
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

228
00:23:51,341 --> 00:23:54,691
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

229
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:55,976
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

230
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,248
He showed My photograph.

231
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:58,273
Finished.

232
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,443
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

233
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:11,892
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

234
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,982
you singing, where are you fixed?"

235
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:16,262
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

236
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:23,712
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

237
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,444
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

238
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:29,782
The fellow was an Englishman.

239
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:33,931
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

240
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,136
Thik He."

241
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:38,698
So these things announcement helps a lot.

242
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:48,262
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

243
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:51,961
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

244
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:58,172
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

245
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:04,332
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

246
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,332
people will know.

247
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:08,722
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

248
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,542
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

249
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,542
If you like you can wear.

250
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,542
But there's a freedom to you.

251
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:15,752
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

252
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:20,592
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

253
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,402
wear these dresses and go about.

254
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:26,442
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

255
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:30,206
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

256
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,231
Why not?

257
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:33,561
They would like to see you in sarees.

258
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,872
If you want you can wear it.

259
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:37,032
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

260
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:39,301
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

261
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:45,972
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

262
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:47,912
and those jeans and things like that.

263
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:49,212
So it doesn't matter.

264
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:51,492
But then don't feel guilty with it.

265
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:56,092
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

266
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:58,992
Be a brave person.

267
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:03,872
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

268
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:06,082
Because you are brave you are doing it.

269
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:07,592
That's the culture that has to come.

270
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:11,332
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

271
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:14,212
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

272
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:15,311
Is it good?

273
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:21,152
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

274
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:24,552
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

275
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,832
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

276
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:30,612
All right, some people can, but not all.

277
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:35,421
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

278
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:39,692
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

279
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:45,082
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

280
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:50,792
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

281
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,321
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

282
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:57,362
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

283
00:26:57,362 --> 00:27:04,612
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

284
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,612
beings.

285
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:10,551
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

286
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:12,342
into the state of Virata.

287
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:16,882
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

288
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:21,662
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

289
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,552
How can you be guilty?

290
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:26,362
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

291
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:27,912
He's the One.

292
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,026
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

293
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,387
You don't blame your hand for it.

294
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:35,873
What you blame is the body.

295
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:38,412
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

296
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:40,212
The body takes over.

297
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:43,622
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

298
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:48,068
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

299
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:52,349
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

300
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,770
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

301
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,679
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

302
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,990
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

303
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,530
It has no place.

304
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,070
It has no place.

305
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,500
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

306
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,820
What's the logic?

307
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,430
You cannot feel guilty.

308
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:24,570
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

309
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,390
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

310
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,340
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

311
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,080
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

312
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,150
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

313
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,150
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

314
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:46,660
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

315
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
No!

316
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:55,215
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

317
00:28:57,913 --> 00:29:05,130
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

318
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,620
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

319
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:12,579
The collectivity part of it.

320
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:18,076
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

321
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:22,729
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

322
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:27,209
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

323
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:35,333
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

324
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:45,466
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

325
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,514
into thin air.

326
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:53,011
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

327
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:55,651
God knows where it has gone.

328
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:59,969
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

329
00:29:59,994 --> 00:30:01,810
what it is.

330
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:12,239
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

331
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:21,668
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

332
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,821
Herself, shines and announces.

333
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:27,359
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

334
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:28,129
it?

335
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:29,676
We are saints.

336
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:30,781
Of course we are.

337
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:31,966
"Are you saints??"

338
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:33,151
"Yes, we are."

339
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,894
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

340
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:40,443
to feel shy about it.

341
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:45,200
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

342
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:49,281
But here we dare not have any procession.

343
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:54,346
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

344
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:55,632
a procession.

345
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:58,948
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

346
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:03,689
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

347
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:09,401
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

348
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,344
to announce, then you are.

349
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:17,531
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

350
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:22,182
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

351
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:23,207
about it.

352
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:28,781
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

353
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:32,713
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

354
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:39,731
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

355
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,311
guilty about everything.

356
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:45,551
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

357
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,911
That's the trouble.

358
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:50,481
Think of it positively.

359
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:55,171
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

360
00:31:55,171 --> 00:32:00,631
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

361
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:02,961
have gone further."

362
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:09,171
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

363
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:14,551
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

364
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:15,551
destiny?

365
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:18,899
What have you to become?

366
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:23,791
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

367
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:28,330
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

368
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,142
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

369
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:41,281
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

370
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,525
can create so many things - it's true.

371
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,690
But, that is not your destiny.

372
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,820
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

373
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,371
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

374
00:32:56,371 --> 00:33:00,031
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

375
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:05,301
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

376
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:09,810
only a few people were there putting the posters.

377
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:19,251
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

378
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:23,401
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

379
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,710
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

380
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,391
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

381
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:34,940
my, my, my, my that, my that."

382
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,731
So they live in an island.

383
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:42,101
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

384
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:45,271
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

385
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:46,491
Then they feel guilty.

386
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,291
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

387
00:33:50,291 --> 00:34:02,671
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

388
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:04,381
of the whole of humanity.

389
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:12,060
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

390
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,505
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

391
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,530
way.

392
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:24,651
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

393
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:32,320
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

394
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,440
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

395
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,141
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

396
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:46,106
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

397
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:52,041
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

398
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,491
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

399
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:57,058
They don't have to possess anyone.

400
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:02,081
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

401
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:05,861
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

402
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:14,177
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

403
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:20,460
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

404
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,433
parcel of the whole.

405
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:28,162
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

406
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:32,981
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

407
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:40,231
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

408
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:44,341
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

409
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,959
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

410
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:49,921
We are all one.

411
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,244
So what is there to say sorry?

412
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:55,229
There is no foreigner within us.

413
00:35:55,254 --> 00:36:01,943
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

414
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:02,968
or anything.

415
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:09,413
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

416
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:15,003
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

417
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:18,863
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

418
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:22,283
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

419
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,702
They are part and parcel of My being.

420
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:27,443
So why should I send this to them?

421
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,893
But I can nourish them.

422
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:35,092
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

423
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:40,383
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

424
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:45,283
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

425
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:49,623
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

426
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:50,623
Think about it.

427
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:54,702
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

428
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,003
It is sometimes so.

429
00:36:56,003 --> 00:37:05,783
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

430
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:11,483
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

431
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,393
they started the song.

432
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:19,043
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

433
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:21,413
that I like this song."

434
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:27,243
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

435
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:29,812
also pleasing other people.

436
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:31,847
The example of that is like this.

437
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:35,757
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

438
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:40,933
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

439
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:46,297
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

440
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,456
mozzarella cheese.

441
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,537
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

442
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:56,866
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

443
00:37:56,866 --> 00:38:00,169
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

444
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,537
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

445
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:04,537
"Eh, you have a choice?"

446
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:06,427
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

447
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,436
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

448
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:13,437
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

449
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:24,437
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

450
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:28,016
So this kind of understanding shows what?

451
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:33,467
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

452
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:36,317
You have not seen Me.

453
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:41,847
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

454
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:43,565
mozzarella, mozzarella.

455
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:49,787
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

456
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:54,937
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

457
00:38:54,937 --> 00:39:01,277
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

458
00:39:01,277 --> 00:39:02,277
no choice of anything.

459
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:08,217
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

460
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:12,136
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

461
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,496
I don't make fuss about things.

462
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:21,577
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

463
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:23,126
that they are not collective.

464
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:25,297
Collective is to understand Me fully.

465
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:31,886
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

466
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,157
They all know about it.

467
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:35,147
They know about the whole body.

468
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:37,516
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

469
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:43,667
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

470
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,386
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

471
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:53,047
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

472
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,016
thousand names of the Goddess.

473
00:39:55,016 --> 00:40:01,207
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

474
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:06,277
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

475
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:09,053
She can finish people.

476
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:12,127
She's absolutely wrathful.

477
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:13,407
It's true, I accept, it is so.

478
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:16,307
But it is so, so it is so.

479
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:20,277
But you must understand My in full ways.

480
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:25,677
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

481
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:32,327
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

482
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:37,126
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

483
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:44,347
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

484
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:46,777
So the other side will definitely punish you.

485
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:55,787
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

486
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,438
understood properly.

487
00:40:57,604 --> 00:41:01,776
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

488
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:05,767
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

489
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:10,696
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

490
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:15,226
Try to understand the essence of everything.

491
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:18,566
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

492
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:21,756
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

493
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:33,213
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

494
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:35,563
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

495
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:38,104
We don't have to judge it mentally.

496
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:41,803
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

497
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:42,803
What is the need?

498
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,423
Ten minutes is sufficient.

499
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:49,123
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

500
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:55,063
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

501
00:41:55,063 --> 00:42:00,764
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

502
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:05,933
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

503
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:10,754
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

504
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:15,004
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

505
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,454
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

506
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:22,083
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

507
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:29,413
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

508
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,343
maximum love.

509
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:35,913
So many there are ways of handling things.

510
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:43,244
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

511
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:49,873
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

512
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:53,123
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

513
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:55,903
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

514
00:42:55,903 --> 00:43:02,474
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

515
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:09,534
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

516
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:16,204
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

517
00:43:16,204 --> 00:43:18,464
You are not facing it.

518
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:21,814
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

519
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:27,704
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

520
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:32,224
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

521
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:40,554
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

522
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:43,393
Because that is the essence.

523
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:48,474
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

524
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:53,524
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

525
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:55,994
mantras, they are not effective.

526
00:43:55,994 --> 00:44:05,433
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

527
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,774
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

528
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:13,774
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

529
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:22,652
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

530
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:23,884
It has the full effect.

531
00:44:51,351 --> 00:45:01,902
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

532
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:08,937
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

533
00:45:08,937 --> 00:45:09,937
bad.

534
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:12,846
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

535
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:13,866
You will do it.

536
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:16,397
You will hurt others.

537
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:17,397
You will torture others.

538
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:18,397
You will take advantage of them.

539
00:45:18,397 --> 00:45:21,266
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

540
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:26,137
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

541
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:31,437
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

542
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:38,116
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

543
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:44,177
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

544
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:54,466
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

545
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:57,427
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

546
00:45:57,427 --> 00:46:02,457
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

547
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:06,887
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

548
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:11,856
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

549
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:13,743
come and correct the sister.

550
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:19,748
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

551
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:22,349
relationship that you could think of.

552
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:28,208
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

553
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:33,628
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

554
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:39,538
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

555
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:42,978
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

556
00:46:42,978 --> 00:46:48,968
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

557
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:55,278
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

558
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:56,918
it as a guilt.

559
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:59,959
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

560
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:05,788
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

561
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:10,859
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

562
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:17,339
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

563
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:28,139
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

564
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:35,258
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

565
00:47:35,258 --> 00:47:40,668
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

566
00:47:40,668 --> 00:47:49,468
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

567
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:50,468
pleasure.

568
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:55,929
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

569
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:59,988
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

570
00:47:59,988 --> 00:48:01,138
sister, doesn't matter.

571
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:07,708
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

572
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:12,609
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

573
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:16,978
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

574
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,709
the sisters.

575
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:24,958
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

576
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:28,125
open - there should be no formality in it.

577
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,056
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

578
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:37,198
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

579
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:39,762
But it can be the other way around.

580
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:45,337
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

581
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:49,107
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

582
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:50,247
So what?

583
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:53,148
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

584
00:48:53,148 --> 00:48:56,363
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

585
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:57,443
Finished.

586
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,038
That's broken long time back.

587
00:48:59,063 --> 00:49:02,278
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

588
00:49:02,303 --> 00:49:07,668
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

589
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:12,658
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

590
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:19,077
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

591
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:28,778
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

592
00:49:28,778 --> 00:49:32,009
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

593
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,987
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

594
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:39,507
That's why the discretion stands in between.

595
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:43,557
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

596
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:44,844
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

597
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:47,457
That discretion is in between.

598
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:54,577
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

599
00:49:54,577 --> 00:50:00,807
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:05,457
Other than that it doesn't exist.

601
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:10,117
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

602
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:19,045
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

603
00:50:19,378 --> 00:50:26,557
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

604
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:29,023
May God Bless you!

605
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:34,962
Now for a puja, we should have a very simple puja.

606
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:38,152
Actually, I was saying there’s no need to give Me a saree

607
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:42,065
 because I am not anybody’s sister or a brother.

608
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:50,380
But Rakhi day, My brother is here.

609
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:57,694
 It’s nice that we can have it in a way My physical brother is here.

610
00:50:58,163 --> 00:51:04,580
 It’s very good we are having a rakhi program today in his presence.

611
00:51:04,787 --> 00:51:12,867
 And, all of you should also understand
that it’s a very subtle, pure,

612
00:51:12,954 --> 00:51:19,514
beautiful relationship that exists between a brother and a sister.

613
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,834
Talk after puja 03:38

614
03:38:01,327 --> 03:38:06,607
Tomorrow of course you all can rest and enjoy yourself.

615
03:38:06,768 --> 03:38:09,659
But day after tomorrow is the programme

616
03:38:10,324 --> 03:38:12,724
for these musicians who have come.

617
03:38:12,814 --> 03:38:15,943
But I was thinking we should also combine

618
03:38:16,078 --> 03:38:19,175
some of you with them when they are singing

619
03:38:19,231 --> 03:38:21,694
so you also could bring your

620
03:38:21,790 --> 03:38:26,445
as we call them, to play with them.

621
03:38:27,366 --> 03:38:31,931
Plus we could have some nice English music also,

622
03:38:32,067 --> 03:38:34,816
a few English nice music things, you see.

623
03:38:34,983 --> 03:38:38,416
This is American, this she has [sung]:

624
03:38:38,686 --> 03:38:40,864
The Whole World In Your Hands is American.

625
03:38:40,889 --> 03:38:44,684
So why not something English which is faster, one or two?

626
03:38:44,780 --> 03:38:47,695
So, also you should play something English.

627
03:38:47,775 --> 03:38:52,611
Also bring your maridas  (bells) it’s better
 that you should bring them.

628
03:38:53,104 --> 03:38:56,045
And I hope you will all be there

629
03:38:56,411 --> 03:38:59,930
and you’ll be there to sing these.

630
03:38:59,986 --> 03:39:02,051
If you sing these Hindi songs

631
03:39:02,086 --> 03:39:05,522
and Marathi songs they’ll be all surprised.

632
03:39:05,665 --> 03:39:10,161
You see, nobody has picked up these things
so fast as you people have.

633
03:39:10,312 --> 03:39:13,245
It shows that, once you have your Self-realisation,

634
03:39:13,349 --> 03:39:18,343
you can pick up any music, you can pick up any kind of a

635
03:39:18,784 --> 03:39:21,156
rhythm very easily.

636
03:39:21,553 --> 03:39:29,291
And we can show them that we are all united,
we are one religion,

637
03:39:29,370 --> 03:39:33,566
what we call as the ‘pure religion’ which is within us.

638
03:39:33,860 --> 03:39:39,629
We do not believe in separating people

639
03:39:40,003 --> 03:39:43,469
who say that, “This religion is good,”
or “That religion is good.”

640
03:39:43,603 --> 03:39:48,337
All religions are good if they are taken in their proper essences.

641
03:39:48,418 --> 03:39:55,479
So we don’t have to part up ourselves
along religion of all the things.

642
03:39:55,861 --> 03:40:00,413
So our religion is Pure Religion which is innate,
which is within us,

643
03:40:00,590 --> 03:40:08,000
which we know about and which we know
how to cleanse and how to use it.

644
03:40:08,103 --> 03:40:12,347
This is a very great thing of Sahaj Yoga

645
03:40:12,569 --> 03:40:17,051
that we are all united together in our Spirits,

646
03:40:17,432 --> 03:40:21,732
not in the outward show or outward things.

647
03:40:21,757 --> 03:40:25,155
And this is what you have to show them that we are all united:

648
03:40:25,235 --> 03:40:27,634
whatever country you may come from,

649
03:40:27,745 --> 03:40:31,105
whatever background you may come from,

650
03:40:31,225 --> 03:40:33,395
we are all one within ourselves.

651
03:40:33,427 --> 03:40:36,705
And this is what the world needs today this oneness.

652
03:40:38,581 --> 03:40:41,594
Also this warmongering and all that comes from

653
03:40:41,667 --> 03:40:47,932
too much of greed and too much of ambitions
which  we do not have;

654
03:40:48,076 --> 03:40:51,287
we have crossed all that, we are satisfied people.

655
03:40:51,454 --> 03:40:57,181
So we don’t fight each other for small things
or for countries or for nations

656
03:40:57,206 --> 03:41:00,079
because the whole world is made by one God,

657
03:41:00,278 --> 03:41:02,266
and He rules the whole world.

658
03:41:02,291 --> 03:41:05,951
It’s stupidity to feel, “This is my country, this is your country,”

659
03:41:05,976 --> 03:41:08,478
and then fight and do all kind of things.

660
03:41:09,090 --> 03:41:13,482
So we don’t believe in all this mess
and these human made differences.

661
03:41:13,522 --> 03:41:19,832
We believe in the oneness of our

662
03:41:20,521 --> 03:41:24,401
belief and in our understanding

663
03:41:24,427 --> 03:41:28,088
on our central nervous system, that we know the truth,

664
03:41:28,143 --> 03:41:31,016
this is the truth and we believe in that truth.

665
03:41:31,186 --> 03:41:35,584
So tomorrow we have to show with our patience and our love

666
03:41:35,609 --> 03:41:40,425
and affection to these English people.
I hope something will go into their heads also,

667
03:41:40,450 --> 03:41:45,501
as it has happened in Switzerland.
We have to break their ices.

668
03:41:46,038 --> 03:41:50,270
Tomorrow it should be arranged in such a way
 that they should feel that there’s no quarrel,

669
03:41:50,278 --> 03:41:52,385
there’s no argument, there’s no struggle,

670
03:41:52,386 --> 03:41:56,078
nothing; we are so smoothly, all of us are, together,

671
03:41:56,103 --> 03:41:58,477
to help each other to work it out

672
03:41:58,509 --> 03:42:00,670
and to be kind  to each other.

673
03:42:00,822 --> 03:42:06,246
I will be happy if you can provide some kind of a refreshment also,

674
03:42:07,448 --> 03:42:11,124
so that they will feel that there is something.

675
03:42:11,236 --> 03:42:15,477
And very loving and good mannered you must talk to all of them.

676
03:42:15,645 --> 03:42:18,783
We could also have some dancing there, doesn’t matter.

677
03:42:18,887 --> 03:42:21,376
We can have some dancing and something.

678
03:42:21,432 --> 03:42:24,196
And now for dancing you must little bit practice.

679
03:42:24,291 --> 03:42:27,389
Should be in some rhythms, you see.

680
03:42:34,799 --> 03:42:40,081
But should be nice and beautifully done and should be proper.

681
03:42:40,106 --> 03:42:43,986
And dancing is an expression of the body of your joy

682
03:42:44,034 --> 03:42:46,197
and should be in proper rhythm.

683
03:42:46,221 --> 03:42:49,046
I was surprised, this time when I came,

684
03:42:49,086 --> 03:42:54,449
I saw, I think it was in two, three films,

685
03:42:54,513 --> 03:42:58,117
documentaries, they were showing dancing as a theme:

686
03:42:58,136 --> 03:43:01,188
how dancing has evolved, how dancing is important,

687
03:43:01,215 --> 03:43:02,842
how it has to by rhythmic.

688
03:43:02,875 --> 03:43:05,034
They were also showing about African dancing,

689
03:43:05,059 --> 03:43:09,833
how it is so artistic and beautifully done.

690
03:43:09,992 --> 03:43:13,042
So I mean, this has started already,

691
03:43:13,075 --> 03:43:15,578
to feel that dancing in proper rhythm

692
03:43:15,587 --> 03:43:20,312
and proper ecstasy is an expression of the inner joy.

693
03:43:20,354 --> 03:43:23,314
But should not be frantic and should not be funny

694
03:43:23,347 --> 03:43:26,762
and I don’t think we should shout much in between shown

695
03:43:26,859 --> 03:43:31,434
but we can say something nice, that would be better:

696
03:43:31,499 --> 03:43:33,929
in a way that it should not look [like] vulgar dancing,

697
03:43:33,954 --> 03:43:35,501
that’s what I want to say.

698
03:43:35,532 --> 03:43:39,020
You, yourselves have to judge it; now you are all great saints

699
03:43:39,045 --> 03:43:40,985
and walis and prophets so

700
03:43:41,017 --> 03:43:44,847
I have to keep my words,

701
03:43:44,879 --> 03:43:48,301
discreetly for you to judge yourself and to say things

702
03:43:48,341 --> 03:43:51,335
and to do things which are sensible.

703
03:43:51,407 --> 03:43:54,506
So we’ll have somebody as a compere

704
03:43:54,538 --> 03:43:57,445
and somebody who has to say things properly,

705
03:43:57,470 --> 03:44:02,068
to explain things beforehand so that nobody gets

706
03:44:02,078 --> 03:44:06,033
sort of worried or upset or bored — that’s the main thing.

707
03:44:06,074 --> 03:44:10,514
And you should not have many songs with the slow tone.

708
03:44:10,539 --> 03:44:16,085
I think even in English music
they should start with very fast numbers.

709
03:44:17,288 --> 03:44:20,795
 ‘Ai giri nandini’ or they can start with ‘Jogawa’ or something

710
03:44:20,812 --> 03:44:23,411
and then end up also with fast tones.

711
03:44:23,442 --> 03:44:27,251
But should be slow because they don’t understand any language.

712
03:44:29,148 --> 03:44:34,227
